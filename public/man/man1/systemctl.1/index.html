</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p><strong>list-units</strong> [/PATTERN/…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>List units that <strong>systemd</strong> currently has in memory. This includes units
that are either referenced directly or through a dependency, units that
are pinned by applications programmatically, or units that were active
in the past and have failed. By default only units which are active,
have pending jobs, or have failed are shown; this can be changed with
option <strong>–all</strong>. If one or more /PATTERN/s are specified, only units
matching one of them are shown. The units that are shown are
additionally filtered by <strong>–type=</strong> and <strong>–state=</strong> if those options are
specified.</p>
<p>
Note that this command does not show unit templates, but only instances
of unit templates. Units templates that arent instantiated are not
runnable, and will thus never show up in the output of this command.
Specifically this means that foo@.service will never be shown in this
list — unless instantiated, e.g. as foo@bar.service. Use
<strong>list-unit-files</strong> (see below) for listing installed unit template files.</p>
<p>
Produces output similar to</p>
<blockquote>

LOAD   = Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.
ACTIVE = The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.
SUB    = The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.

123 loaded units listed. Pass --all to see loaded but inactive units, too.
To show all installed unit files use systemctl list-unit-files.

The header and the last unit of a given type are underlined if the
terminal supports that. A colored dot is shown next to services which
were masked, not found, or otherwise failed.</p>

The LOAD column shows the load state, one of <strong>loaded</strong>, <strong>not-found</strong>,
<strong>bad-setting</strong>, <strong>error</strong>, <strong>masked</strong>. The ACTIVE columns shows the general
unit state, one of <strong>active</strong>, <strong>reloading</strong>, <strong>inactive</strong>, <strong>failed</strong>,
<strong>activating</strong>, <strong>deactivating</strong>. The SUB column shows the
unit-type-specific detailed state of the unit, possible values vary by
unit type. The list of possible LOAD, ACTIVE, and SUB states is not
constant and new systemd releases may both add and remove values.</p>

<p>
<strong>is-active */PATTERN/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Check whether any of the specified units are active (i.e. running).
Returns an exit code <strong>0</strong> if at least one is active, or non-zero
otherwise. Unless <strong>–quiet</strong> is specified, this will also print the
current unit state to standard output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*is-failed [*/PATTERN/…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Check whether any of the specified units is in the &#34;failed&#34; state. If no
unit is specified, check whether there are any failed units, which
corresponds to the &#34;degraded&#34; state returned by <strong>is-system-running</strong>.
Returns an exit code <strong>0</strong> if at least one has failed, non-zero otherwise.
Unless <strong>–quiet</strong> is specified, this will also print the current unit or
system state to standard output.</p>
<p>
Added in version 197.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>status</strong> [/PATTERN/…|/PID/…]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show runtime status information about the whole system or about one or
more units followed by most recent log data from the journal. If no
positional arguments are specified, and no unit filter is given with
<strong>–type=</strong>, <strong>–state=</strong>, or <strong>–failed</strong>, shows the status of the whole
system. If combined with <strong>–all</strong>, follows that with the status of all
units. If positional arguments are specified, each positional argument
is treated as either a unit name to show, or a glob pattern to show
units whose names match that pattern, or a PID to show the unit
containing that PID. When <strong>–type=</strong>, <strong>–state=</strong>, or <strong>–failed</strong> are used,
units are additionally filtered by the TYPE and ACTIVE state.</p>
<p>
This function is intended to generate human-readable output. If you are
looking for computer-parsable output, use <strong>show</strong> instead. By default,
this function only shows 10 lines of output and ellipsizes lines to fit
in the terminal window. This can be changed with <strong>–lines</strong> and <strong>–full</strong>,
see above. In addition, *journalctl –unit=*/NAME/ or *journalctl
–user-unit=*/NAME/ use a similar filter for messages and might be more
convenient.</p>
<p>
Note that this operation only displays <em>runtime</em> status, i.e.
information about the current invocation of the unit (if it is running)
or the most recent invocation (if it is not running anymore, and has not
been released from memory). Information about earlier invocations,
invocations from previous system boots, or prior invocations that have
already been released from memory may be retrieved via <strong>journalctl
–unit=</strong>.</p>
<p>
systemd implicitly loads units as necessary, so just running the
<strong>status</strong> will attempt to load a file. The command is thus not useful for
determining if something was already loaded or not. The units may
possibly also be quickly unloaded after the operation is completed if
theres no reason to keep it in memory thereafter.</p>

<p>
The dot (&#34;●&#34;) uses color on supported terminals to summarize the unit
state at a glance. Along with its color, its shape varies according to
its state: &#34;inactive&#34; or &#34;maintenance&#34; is a white circle (&#34;○&#34;), &#34;active&#34;
is a green dot (&#34;●&#34;), &#34;deactivating&#34; is a white dot, &#34;failed&#34; or &#34;error&#34;
is a red cross (&#34;×&#34;), and &#34;reloading&#34; is a green clockwise circle arrow
(&#34;↻&#34;).</p>
<p>
The &#34;Loaded:&#34; line in the output will show &#34;loaded&#34; if the unit has been
loaded into memory. Other possible values for &#34;Loaded:&#34; include: &#34;error&#34;
if there was a problem loading it, &#34;not-found&#34; if no unit file was found
for this unit, &#34;bad-setting&#34; if an essential unit file setting could not
be parsed and &#34;masked&#34; if the unit file has been masked. Along with
showing the path to the unit file, this line will also show the
enablement state. Enabled units are included in the dependency network
between units, and thus are started at boot or via some other form of
activation. See the full table of possible enablement states —
including the definition of &#34;masked&#34; — in the documentation for the
<strong>is-enabled</strong> command.</p>
<p>
The &#34;Active:&#34; line shows active state. The value is usually &#34;active&#34; or
&#34;inactive&#34;. Active could mean started, bound, plugged in, etc depending
on the unit type. The unit could also be in process of changing states,
reporting a state of &#34;activating&#34; or &#34;deactivating&#34;. A special &#34;failed&#34;
state is entered when the service failed in some way, such as a crash,
exiting with an error code or timing out. If the failed state is entered
the cause will be logged for later reference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>show</strong> [/PATTERN/…|/JOB/…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show properties of one or more units, jobs, or the manager itself. If no
argument is specified, properties of the manager will be shown. If a
unit name is specified, properties of the unit are shown, and if a job
ID is specified, properties of the job are shown. By default, empty
properties are suppressed. Use <strong>–all</strong> to show those too. To select
specific properties to show, use <strong>–property=</strong>. This command is intended
to be used whenever computer-parsable output is required. Use <strong>status</strong>
if you are looking for formatted human-readable output.</p>
<p>
Many properties shown by <strong>systemctl show</strong> map directly to configuration
settings of the system and service manager and its unit files. Note that
the properties shown by the command are generally more low-level,
normalized versions of the original configuration settings and expose
runtime state in addition to configuration. For example, properties
shown for service units include the services current main process
identifier as &#34;MainPID&#34; (which is runtime state), and time settings are
always exposed as properties ending in the &#34;…USec&#34; suffix even if a
matching configuration options end in &#34;…Sec&#34;, because microseconds is
the normalized time unit used internally by the system and service
manager.</p>
<p>
For details about many of these properties, see the documentation of the
D-Bus interface backing these properties, see
*org.freedesktop.systemd1*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>cat */PATTERN/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show backing files of one or more units. Prints the &#34;fragment&#34; and
&#34;drop-ins&#34; (source files) of units. Each file is preceded by a comment
which includes the file name. Note that this shows the contents of the
backing files on disk, which might not match the system managers
understanding of these units if any unit files were updated on disk and
the <strong>daemon-reload</strong> command wasnt issued since.</p>
<p>
Added in version 209.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>help */PATTERN/</strong>…|*/PID/*…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show manual pages for one or more units, if available. If a PID is
given, the manual pages for the unit the process belongs to are shown.</p>
<p>
Added in version 185.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>list-dependencies</strong> [/UNIT/…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shows units required and wanted by the specified units. This recursively
lists units following the <em>Requires=</em>, <em>Requisite=</em>, <em>Wants=</em>,
<em>ConsistsOf=</em>, <em>BindsTo=</em>, and <em>Upholds=</em> dependencies. If no units are
specified, default.target is implied.</p>
<p>
The units that are shown are additionally filtered by <strong>–type=</strong> and
<strong>–state=</strong> if those options are specified. Note that we wont be able to
use a tree structure in this case, so <strong>–plain</strong> is implied.</p>
<p>
By default, only target units are recursively expanded. When <strong>–all</strong> is
passed, all other units are recursively expanded as well.</p>
<p>
Options <strong>–reverse</strong>, <strong>–after</strong>, <strong>–before</strong> may be used to change what
types of dependencies are shown.</p>
<p>
Note that this command only lists units currently loaded into memory by
the service manager. In particular, this command is not suitable to get
a comprehensive list at all reverse dependencies on a specific unit, as
it wont list the dependencies declared by units currently not loaded.</p>
<p>
Added in version 198.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>start */PATTERN/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Start (activate) one or more units specified on the command line.</p>
<p>
Note that unit glob patterns expand to names of units currently in
memory. Units which are not active and are not in a failed state usually
are not in memory, and will not be matched by any pattern. In addition,
in case of instantiated units, systemd is often unaware of the instance
name until the instance has been started. Therefore, using glob patterns
with <strong>start</strong> has limited usefulness. Also, secondary alias names of
units are not considered.</p>
<p>
Option <strong>–all</strong> may be used to also operate on inactive units which are
referenced by other loaded units. Note that this is not the same as
operating on &#34;all&#34; possible units, because as the previous paragraph
describes, such a list is ill-defined. Nevertheless, *systemctl start
–all */GLOB/ may be useful if all the units that should match the
pattern are pulled in by some target which is known to be loaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>stop */PATTERN/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop (deactivate) one or more units specified on the command line.</p>
<p>
This command will fail if the unit does not exist or if stopping of the
unit is prohibited (see <em>RefuseManualStop=</em> in *systemd.unit*(5)). It
will <em>not</em> fail if any of the commands configured to stop the unit
(<em>ExecStop=</em>, etc.) fail, because the manager will still forcibly
terminate the unit.</p>
<p>
If a unit that gets stopped can still be triggered by other units, a
warning containing the names of the triggering units is shown.
<strong>–no-warn</strong> can be used to suppress the warning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>reload */PATTERN/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asks all units listed on the command line to reload their configuration.
Note that this will reload the service-specific configuration, not the
unit configuration file of systemd. If you want systemd to reload the
configuration file of a unit, use the <strong>daemon-reload</strong> command. In other
words: for the example case of Apache, this will reload Apaches
httpd.conf in the web server, not the apache.service systemd unit file.</p>
<p>
This command should not be confused with the <strong>daemon-reload</strong> command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>restart */PATTERN/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop and then start one or more units specified on the command line. If
the units are not running yet, they will be started.</p>
<p>
Note that restarting a unit with this command does not necessarily flush
out all of the units resources before it is started again. For example,
the per-service file descriptor storage facility (see
<em>FileDescriptorStoreMax=</em> in *systemd.service*(5)) will remain intact as
long as the unit has a job pending, and is only cleared when the unit is
fully stopped and no jobs are pending anymore. If it is intended that
the file descriptor store is flushed out, too, during a restart
operation an explicit <strong>systemctl stop</strong> command followed by <strong>systemctl
start</strong> should be issued.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>try-restart */PATTERN/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop and then start one or more units specified on the command line if
the units are running. This does nothing if units are not running.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>reload-or-restart */PATTERN/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reload one or more units if they support it. If not, stop and then start
them instead. If the units are not running yet, they will be started.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>try-reload-or-restart */PATTERN/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reload one or more units if they support it. If not, stop and then start
them instead. This does nothing if the units are not running.</p>
<p>
Added in version 229.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*isolate */UNIT/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Start the unit specified on the command line and its dependencies and
stop all others, unless they have <strong>IgnoreOnIsolate=yes</strong> (see
*systemd.unit*(5)). If a unit name with no extension is given, an
extension of &#34;.target&#34; will be assumed.</p>
<p>
This command is dangerous, since it will immediately stop processes that
are not enabled in the new target, possibly including the graphical
environment or terminal you are currently using.</p>
<p>
Note that this operation is allowed only on units where <strong>AllowIsolate=</strong>
is enabled. See *systemd.unit*(5) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>kill */PATTERN/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Send a UNIX process signal to one or more processes of the unit. Use
<strong>–kill-whom=</strong> to select which process to send the signal to. Use
<strong>–signal=</strong> to select the signal to send. Combine with <strong>–kill-value=</strong>
to enqueue a POSIX Realtime Signal with an associated value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>clean */PATTERN/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remove the configuration, state, cache, logs or runtime data of the
specified units. Use <strong>–what=</strong> to select which kind of resource to
remove. For service units this may be used to remove the directories
configured with <em>ConfigurationDirectory=</em>, <em>StateDirectory=</em>,
<em>CacheDirectory=</em>, <em>LogsDirectory=</em> and <em>RuntimeDirectory=</em>, see
*systemd.exec*(5) for details. It may also be used to clear the file
descriptor store as enabled via <em>FileDescriptorStoreMax=</em>, see
*systemd.service*(5) for details. For timer units this may be used to
clear out the persistent timestamp data if <em>Persistent=</em> is used and
<strong>–what=state</strong> is selected, see <strong>systemd.timer*(5). This command only
applies to units that use either of these settings. If *–what=</strong> is not
specified, the cache and runtime data as well as the file descriptor
store are removed (as these three types of resources are generally
redundant and reproducible on the next invocation of the unit). Note
that the specified units must be stopped to invoke this operation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Freeze one or more units specified on the command line using cgroup
freezer</p>
<p>
Freezing the unit will cause all processes contained within the cgroup
corresponding to the unit to be suspended. Being suspended means that
units processes wont be scheduled to run on CPU until thawed. Note that
this command is supported only on systems that use unified cgroup
hierarchy. Unit is automatically thawed just before we execute a job
against the unit, e.g. before the unit is stopped.</p>

<p>
<strong>thaw */PATTERN/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thaw (unfreeze) one or more units specified on the command line.</p>
<p>
This is the inverse operation to the <strong>freeze</strong> command and resumes the
execution of processes in the units cgroup.</p>
<p>
Added in version 246.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>set-property */UNIT/</strong> <strong><em>PROPERTY/*=*/VALUE</em></strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the specified unit properties at runtime where this is supported.
This allows changing configuration parameter properties such as resource
control settings at runtime. Not all properties may be changed at
runtime, but many resource control settings (primarily those in
<strong>systemd.resource-control*(5)) may. The changes are applied immediately,
and stored on disk for future boots, unless *–runtime</strong> is passed, in
which case the settings only apply until the next reboot. The syntax of
the property assignment follows closely the syntax of assignments in
unit files.</p>
<p>
Example: <strong>systemctl set-property foobar.service CPUWeight=200</strong></p>
<p>
If the specified unit appears to be inactive, the changes will be only
stored on disk as described previously hence they will be effective when
the unit will be started.</p>
<p>
Note that this command allows changing multiple properties at the same
time, which is preferable over setting them individually.</p>
<p>
Example: <strong>systemctl set-property foobar.service CPUWeight=200
MemoryMax=2G IPAccounting=yes</strong></p>
<p>
Like with unit file configuration settings, assigning an empty setting
usually resets a property to its defaults.</p>
<p>
Example: <strong>systemctl set-property avahi-daemon.service IPAddressDeny=</strong></p>

<strong>bind</strong> <em>UNIT</em> <em>PATH</em> [/PATH/]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bind-mounts a file or directory from the host into the specified units
mount namespace. The first path argument is the source file or directory
on the host, the second path argument is the destination file or
directory in the units mount namespace. When the latter is omitted, the
destination path in the units mount namespace is the same as the source
path on the host. When combined with the <strong>–read-only</strong> switch, a
ready-only bind mount is created. When combined with the <strong>–mkdir</strong>
switch, the destination path is first created before the mount is
applied.</p>
<p>
Note that this option is currently only supported for units that run
within a mount namespace (e.g.: with <strong>RootImage=</strong>, <strong>PrivateMounts=</strong>,
etc.). This command supports bind-mounting directories, regular files,
device nodes, <strong>AF_UNIX</strong> socket nodes, as well as FIFOs. The bind mount
is ephemeral, and it is undone as soon as the current unit process
exists. Note that the namespace mentioned here, where the bind mount
will be added to, is the one where the main service process runs. Other
processes (those exececuted by <strong>ExecReload=</strong>, <strong>ExecStartPre=</strong>, etc.) run
in distinct namespaces.</p>
<p>
If supported by the kernel, any prior mount on the selected target will
be replaced by the new mount. If not supported, any prior mount will be
over-mounted, but remain pinned and inaccessible.</p>
<p>
Added in version 248.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>mount-image</strong> <em>UNIT</em> <em>IMAGE</em> [/PATH/ [/PARTITION_NAME/:/MOUNT_OPTIONS/]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mounts an image from the host into the specified units mount namespace.
The first path argument is the source image on the host, the second path
argument is the destination directory in the units mount namespace (i.e.
inside <strong>RootImage=*/*RootDirectory=</strong>). The following argument, if any,
is interpreted as a colon-separated tuple of partition name and
comma-separated list of mount options for that partition. The format is
the same as the service <strong>MountImages=</strong> setting. When combined with the
<strong>–read-only</strong> switch, a ready-only mount is created. When combined with
the <strong>–mkdir</strong> switch, the destination path is first created before the
mount is applied.</p>
<p>
Note that this option is currently only supported for units that run
within a mount namespace (i.e. with <strong>RootImage=</strong>, <strong>PrivateMounts=</strong>,
etc.). Note that the namespace mentioned here where the image mount will
be added to, is the one where the main service process runs. Note that
the namespace mentioned here, where the bind mount will be added to, is

<strong>service-log-level</strong> <em>SERVICE</em> [/LEVEL/]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the <em>LEVEL</em> argument is not given, print the current log level as
reported by service <em>SERVICE</em>.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument <em>LEVEL</em> is provided, then change the current

syslog log level, i.e. a value in the range 0…7 or one of the strings
<strong>emerg</strong>, <strong>alert</strong>, <strong>crit</strong>, <strong>err</strong>, <strong>warning</strong>, <strong>notice</strong>, <strong>info</strong>, <strong>debug</strong>;

<strong>service-log-target</strong> <em>SERVICE</em> [/TARGET/]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the <em>TARGET</em> argument is not given, print the current log target as
reported by service <em>SERVICE</em>.</p>
<p>
If the optional argument <em>TARGET</em> is provided, then change the current
log target of the service to <em>TARGET</em>. The log target should be one of
the strings <strong>console</strong> (for log output to the services standard error
stream), <strong>kmsg</strong> (for log output to the kernel log buffer), <strong>journal</strong>
(for log output to <strong>systemd-journald.service*(8) using the native

/dev/log), <strong>null</strong> (for no log output whatsoever) or <strong>auto</strong> (for an
automatically determined choice, typically equivalent to <strong>console</strong> if
the service is invoked interactively, and <strong>journal</strong> or <strong>syslog</strong>
otherwise).</p>
<p>
For most services, only a small subset of log targets make sense. In
particular, most &#34;normal&#34; services should only implement <strong>console</strong>,

<strong>reset-failed [*/PATTERN/</strong>…]*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reset the &#34;failed&#34; state of the specified units, or if no unit name is
passed, reset the state of all units. When a unit fails in some way
(i.e. process exiting with non-zero error code, terminating abnormally
or timing out), it will automatically enter the &#34;failed&#34; state and its
exit code and status is recorded for introspection by the administrator
until the service is stopped/re-started or reset with this command.</p>
<p>
In addition to resetting the &#34;failed&#34; state of a unit it also resets
various other per-unit properties: the start rate limit counter of all
unit types is reset to zero, as is the restart counter of service units.
Thus, if a units start limit (as configured with

<p><strong>list-unit-files</strong> [/PATTERN…/]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>List unit files installed on the system, in combination with their
enablement state (as reported by <strong>is-enabled</strong>). If one or more
/PATTERN/s are specified, only unit files whose name matches one of them
are shown (patterns matching unit file system paths are not supported).</p>
<p>
Unlike <strong>list-units</strong> this command will list template units in addition to
explicitly instantiated units.</p>
<p>
Added in version 233.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>enable */UNIT/</strong>…*, <strong>enable */PATH/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable one or more units or unit instances. This will create a set of
symlinks, as encoded in the [Install] sections of the indicated unit
files. After the symlinks have been created, the system manager
configuration is reloaded (in a way equivalent to <strong>daemon-reload</strong>), in
order to ensure the changes are taken into account immediately. Note
that this does <em>not</em> have the effect of also starting any of the units
being enabled. If this is desired, combine this command with the <strong>–now</strong>
switch, or invoke <strong>start</strong> with appropriate arguments later. Note that in
case of unit instance enablement (i.e. enablement of units of the form
foo@bar.service), symlinks named the same as instances are created in
the unit configuration directory, however they point to the single
template unit file they are instantiated from.</p>
<p>
This command expects either valid unit names (in which case various unit
file directories are automatically searched for unit files with
appropriate names), or absolute paths to unit files (in which case these
files are read directly). If a specified unit file is located outside of
the usual unit file directories, an additional symlink is created,
linking it into the unit configuration path, thus ensuring it is found
when requested by commands such as <strong>start</strong>. The file system where the
linked unit files are located must be accessible when systemd is started
(e.g. anything underneath <em>home</em> or <em>var</em> is not allowed, unless those
directories are located on the root file system).</p>
<p>
This command will print the file system operations executed. This output
may be suppressed by passing <strong>–quiet</strong>.</p>
<p>
Note that this operation creates only the symlinks suggested in the
[Install] section of the unit files. While this command is the
recommended way to manipulate the unit configuration directory, the
administrator is free to make additional changes manually by placing or
removing symlinks below this directory. This is particularly useful to
create configurations that deviate from the suggested default
installation. In this case, the administrator must make sure to invoke
<strong>daemon-reload</strong> manually as necessary, in order to ensure the changes
are taken into account.</p>
<p>
When using this operation on units without install information, a
warning about it is shown. <strong>–no-warn</strong> can be used to suppress the
warning.</p>
<p>
Enabling units should not be confused with starting (activating) units,
as done by the <strong>start</strong> command. Enabling and starting units is
orthogonal: units may be enabled without being started and started
without being enabled. Enabling simply hooks the unit into various
suggested places (for example, so that the unit is automatically started
on boot or when a particular kind of hardware is plugged in). Starting
actually spawns the daemon process (in case of service units), or binds
the socket (in case of socket units), and so on.</p>
<p>
Depending on whether <strong>–system</strong>, <strong>–user</strong>, <strong>–runtime</strong>, or <strong>–global</strong> is
specified, this enables the unit for the system, for the calling user
only, for only this boot of the system, or for all future logins of all
users. Note that in the last case, no systemd daemon configuration is
reloaded.</p>
<p>
Using <strong>enable</strong> on masked units is not supported and results in an error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>disable */UNIT/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disables one or more units. This removes all symlinks to the unit files
backing the specified units from the unit configuration directory, and
hence undoes any changes made by <strong>enable</strong> or <strong>link</strong>. Note that this
removes <em>all</em> symlinks to matching unit files, including manually
created symlinks, and not just those actually created by <strong>enable</strong> or
<strong>link</strong>. Note that while <strong>disable</strong> undoes the effect of <strong>enable</strong>, the two
commands are otherwise not symmetric, as <strong>disable</strong> may remove more
symlinks than a prior <strong>enable</strong> invocation of the same unit created.</p>
<p>
This command expects valid unit names only, it does not accept paths to
unit files.</p>
<p>
In addition to the units specified as arguments, all units are disabled
that are listed in the <em>Also=</em> setting contained in the [Install]
section of any of the unit files being operated on.</p>
<p>
This command implicitly reloads the system manager configuration after
completing the operation. Note that this command does not implicitly
stop the units that are being disabled. If this is desired, either
combine this command with the <strong>–now</strong> switch, or invoke the <strong>stop</strong>
command with appropriate arguments later.</p>
<p>
This command will print information about the file system operations
(symlink removals) executed. This output may be suppressed by passing
<strong>–quiet</strong>.</p>
<p>
If a unit gets disabled but its triggering units are still active, a
warning containing the names of the triggering units is shown.
<strong>–no-warn</strong> can be used to suppress the warning.</p>
<p>
When this command is used with <strong>–user</strong>, the units being operated on
might still be enabled in global scope, and thus get started
automatically even after a successful disablement in user scope. In this
case, a warning about it is shown, which can be suppressed using
<strong>–no-warn</strong>.</p>
<p>
This command honors <strong>–system</strong>, <strong>–user</strong>, <strong>–runtime</strong>, <strong>–global</strong> and
<strong>–no-warn</strong> in a similar way as <strong>enable</strong>.</p>

<strong>mask */UNIT/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mask one or more units, as specified on the command line. This will link
these unit files to /dev/null, making it impossible to start them. This
is a stronger version of <strong>disable</strong>, since it prohibits all kinds of
activation of the unit, including enablement and manual activation. Use
this option with care. This honors the <strong>–runtime</strong> option to only mask
temporarily until the next reboot of the system. The <strong>–now</strong> option may
be used to ensure that the units are also stopped. This command expects
valid unit names only, it does not accept unit file paths.</p>
<p>
Note that this will create a symlink under the units name in
<em>etc/systemd/system</em> (in case <strong>–runtime</strong> is not specified) or
<em>run/systemd/system</em> (in case <strong>–runtime</strong> is specified). If a matching
unit file already exists under these directories this operation will
hence fail. This means that the operation is primarily useful to mask
units shipped by the vendor (as those are shipped in
<em>usr/lib/systemd/system</em> and not the aforementioned two directories),
but typically doesnt work for units created locally (as those are
typically placed precisely in the two aforementioned directories).
Similar restrictions apply for <strong>–user</strong> mode, in which case the
directories are below the users home directory however.</p>
<p>
If a unit gets masked but its triggering units are still active, a
warning containing the names of the triggering units is shown.
<strong>–no-warn</strong> can be used to suppress the warning.</p>

<strong>unmask */UNIT/</strong>…*</p>

<p>
<strong>link */PATH/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Link a unit file that is not in the unit file search path into the unit

The effect of this may be undone with <strong>disable</strong>. The effect of this
command is that a unit file is made available for commands such as
<strong>start</strong>, even though it is not installed directly in the unit search
path. The file system where the linked unit files are located must be
accessible when systemd is started (e.g. anything underneath <em>home</em> or
<em>var</em> is not allowed, unless those directories are located on the root
file system).</p>
<p>

</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>revert */UNIT/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Revert one or more unit files to their vendor versions. This command
removes drop-in configuration files that modify the specified units, as
well as any user-configured unit file that overrides a matching vendor
supplied unit file. Specifically, for a unit &#34;foo.service&#34; the matching
directories &#34;foo.service.d/&#34; with all their contained files are removed,
both below the persistent and runtime configuration directories (i.e.
below <em>etc/systemd/system and /run/systemd/system); if the unit file has
a vendor-supplied version (i.e. a unit file located below /usr</em>) any
matching persistent or runtime unit file that overrides it is removed,
too. Note that if a unit file has no vendor-supplied version (i.e. is
only defined below <em>etc/systemd/system or /run/systemd/system, but not
in a unit file stored below /usr</em>), then it is not removed. Also, if a
unit is masked, it is unmasked.</p>
<p>
Effectively, this command may be used to undo all changes made with
<strong>systemctl edit</strong>, <strong>systemctl set-property</strong> and <strong>systemctl mask</strong> and puts
the original unit file with its settings back in effect.</p>

<strong>edit */UNIT/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Edit or replace a drop-in snippet or the main unit file, to extend or

<p>
Depending on whether <strong>–system</strong> (the default), <strong>–user</strong>, or <strong>–global</strong>
is specified, this command will operate on the system unit files, unit
files for the calling user, or the unit files shared between all users.</p>
<p>
The editor (see the &#34;Environment&#34; section below) is invoked on temporary
files which will be written to the real location if the editor exits
successfully. After the editing is finished, configuration is reloaded,
equivalent to <strong>systemctl daemon-reload –system</strong> or <strong>systemctl
daemon-reload –user</strong>. For <strong>edit –global</strong>, the reload is not performed
and the edits will take effect only for subsequent logins (or after a
reload is requested in a different way).</p>
<p>
If <strong>–full</strong> is specified, a replacement for the main unit file will be
created or edited. Otherwise, a drop-in file will be created or edited.</p>
<p>
If <strong>–drop-in=</strong> is specified, the given drop-in file name will be used
instead of the default override.conf.</p>
<p>
The unit must exist, i.e. its main unit file must be present. If
<strong>–force</strong> is specified, this requirement is ignored and a new unit may
be created (with <strong>–full</strong>), or a drop-in for a nonexistent unit may be
created.</p>
<p>
If <strong>–runtime</strong> is specified, the changes will be made temporarily in
<em>run</em> and they will be lost on the next reboot.</p>
<p>
If <strong>–stdin</strong> is specified, the new contents will be read from standard
input. In this mode, the old contents of the file are discarded.</p>
<p>
If the temporary file is empty upon exit, the modification of the
related unit is canceled.</p>

Note that this command cannot be used to remotely edit units and that
you cannot temporarily edit units which are in <em>etc</em>, since they take
precedence over <em>run</em>.</p>

Environment Commands
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-3">
<p><strong>systemd</strong> supports an environment block that is passed to processes the
manager spawns. The names of the variables can contain ASCII letters,
digits, and the underscore character. Variable names cannot be empty or
start with a digit. In variable values, most characters are allowed, but
the whole sequence must be valid UTF-8. (Note that control characters
like newline (<strong>NL</strong>), tab (<strong>TAB</strong>), or the escape character (<strong>ESC</strong>), <em>are</em>
valid ASCII and thus valid UTF-8). The total length of the environment
block is limited to <strong>_SC_ARG_MAX</strong> value defined by *sysconf*(3).</p>
<p>
<strong>show-environment</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dump the systemd manager environment block. This is the environment
block that is passed to all processes the manager spawns. The
environment block will be dumped in straightforward form suitable for
sourcing into most shells. If no special characters or whitespace is
present in the variable values, no escaping is performed, and the
assignments have the form &#34;VARIABLE=value&#34;. If whitespace or characters
which have special meaning to the shell are present, dollar-single-quote
escaping is used, and assignments have the form &#34;VARIABLE=$value&#34;. This
syntax is known to be supported by *bash*(1), *zsh*(1), *ksh*(1), and
*busybox*(1)s *ash*(1), but not *dash*(1) or *fish*(1).</p>
<p>
Note that this shows the <em>effective</em> block, i.e. the combination of
environment variables configured via configuration files, environment
generators and via IPC (i.e. via the <strong>set-environment</strong> described below).
At the moment a unit process is forked off this combined environment
block will be further combined with per-unit environment variables,
which are not visible in this command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>set-environment */VARIABLE=VALUE/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set one or more service manager environment variables, as specified on
the command line. This command will fail if variable names and values do
not conform to the rules listed above.</p>
<p>
Note that this operates on an environment block separate from the
environment block configured from service manager configuration and
environment generators. Whenever a process is invoked the two blocks are
combined (also incorporating any per-service environment variables), and
passed to it. The <strong>show-environment</strong> verb will show the combination of
the blocks, see above.</p>
<p>
Added in version 233.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>unset-environment */VARIABLE/</strong>…*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unset one or more systemd manager environment variables. If only a
variable name is specified, it will be removed regardless of its value.
If a variable and a value are specified, the variable is only removed if
it has the specified value.</p>
<p>
Note that this operates on an environment block separate from the
environment block configured from service manager configuration and
environment generators. Whenever a process is invoked the two blocks are
combined (also incorporating any per-service environment variables), and
passed to it. The <strong>show-environment</strong> verb will show the combination of
the blocks, see above. Note that this means this command cannot be used
to unset environment variables defined in the service manager
configuration files or via generators.</p>
<p>
Added in version 233.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>import-environment</strong> <em>VARIABLE…</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Import all, one or more environment variables set on the client into the
systemd manager environment block. If a list of environment variable
names is passed, client-side values are then imported into the managers
environment block. If any names are not valid environment variable names
or have invalid values according to the rules described above, an error
is raised. If no arguments are passed, the entire environment block
inherited by the <strong>systemctl</strong> process is imported. In this mode, any
inherited invalid environment variables are quietly ignored.</p>
<p>
Importing of the full inherited environment block (calling this command
without any arguments) is deprecated. A shell will set dozens of
variables which only make sense locally and are only meant for processes
which are descendants of the shell. Such variables in the global
environment block are confusing to other processes.</p>

Manager State Commands
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-3">
<p><strong>daemon-reload</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reload the systemd manager configuration. This will rerun all generators
(see *systemd.generator*(7)), reload all unit files, and recreate the
entire dependency tree. While the daemon is being reloaded, all sockets
systemd listens on behalf of user configuration will stay accessible.</p>
<p>
This command should not be confused with the <strong>reload</strong> command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>daemon-reexec</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reexecute the systemd manager. This will serialize the manager state,
reexecute the process and deserialize the state again. This command is
of little use except for debugging and package upgrades. Sometimes, it
might be helpful as a heavy-weight <strong>daemon-reload</strong>. While the daemon is
being reexecuted, all sockets systemd listening on behalf of user
configuration will stay accessible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>log-level</strong> [/LEVEL/]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If no argument is given, print the current log level of the manager. If
an optional argument <em>LEVEL</em> is provided, then the command changes the
current log level of the manager to <em>LEVEL</em> (accepts the same values as
<strong>–log-level=</strong> described in *systemd*(1)).</p>
<p>
Added in version 244.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>log-target</strong> [/TARGET/]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If no argument is given, print the current log target of the manager. If
an optional argument <em>TARGET</em> is provided, then the command changes the
current log target of the manager to <em>TARGET</em> (accepts the same values
as <strong>–log-target=</strong>, described in *systemd*(1)).</p>
<p>
Added in version 244.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>service-watchdogs</strong> [yes|no]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If no argument is given, print the current state of service runtime
watchdogs of the manager. If an optional boolean argument is provided,
then globally enables or disables the service runtime watchdogs
(<strong>WatchdogSec=</strong>) and emergency actions (e.g. <strong>OnFailure=</strong> or
<strong>StartLimitAction=</strong>); see *systemd.service*(5). The hardware watchdog is
not affected by this setting.</p>

<p><strong>is-system-running</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Checks whether the system is operational. This returns success (exit
code 0) when the system is fully up and running, specifically not in

Failure is returned otherwise (exit code non-zero). In addition, the
current state is printed in a short string to standard output, see the
table below. Use <strong>–quiet</strong> to suppress this output.</p>
<p>
Use <strong>–wait</strong> to wait until the boot process is completed before printing
the current state and returning the appropriate error status. If
<strong>–wait</strong> is in use, states <em>initializing</em> or <em>starting</em> will not be
reported, instead the command will block until a later state (such as

<strong>–no-block</strong> to request asynchronous behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>halt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shut down and halt the system. This is mostly equivalent to <strong>systemctl
start halt.target –job-mode=replace-irreversibly –no-block</strong>, but also
prints a wall message to all users. This command is asynchronous; it
will return after the halt operation is enqueued, without waiting for it
to complete. Note that this operation will simply halt the OS kernel
after shutting down, leaving the hardware powered on. Use <strong>systemctl
poweroff</strong> for powering off the system (see below).</p>
<p>
If combined with <strong>–force</strong>, shutdown of all running services is skipped,
however all processes are killed and all file systems are unmounted or
mounted read-only, immediately followed by the system halt. If <strong>–force</strong>
is specified twice, the operation is immediately executed without
terminating any processes or unmounting any file systems. This may
result in data loss. Note that when <strong>–force</strong> is specified twice the
halt operation is executed by <strong>systemctl</strong> itself, and the system manager
is not contacted. This means the command should succeed even when the
system manager has crashed.</p>
<p>
If combined with <strong>–when=</strong>, shutdown will be scheduled after the given
timestamp. And <strong>–when=cancel</strong> will cancel the shutdown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>poweroff</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shut down and power-off the system. This is mostly equivalent to
<strong>systemctl start poweroff.target –job-mode=replace-irreversibly
–no-block</strong>, but also prints a wall message to all users. This command
is asynchronous; it will return after the power-off operation is
enqueued, without waiting for it to complete.</p>
<p>
This command honors <strong>–force</strong> and <strong>–when=</strong> in a similar way as <strong>halt</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>reboot</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shut down and reboot the system.</p>
<p>
This command mostly equivalent to <strong>systemctl start reboot.target
–job-mode=replace-irreversibly –no-block</strong>, but also prints a wall
message to all users. This command is asynchronous; it will return after
the reboot operation is enqueued, without waiting for it to complete.</p>
<p>
If the switch <strong>–reboot-argument=</strong> is given, it will be passed as the
optional argument to the *reboot*(2) system call.</p>
<p>
Options <strong>–boot-loader-entry=</strong>, <strong>–boot-loader-menu=</strong>, and
<strong>–firmware-setup</strong> can be used to select what to do <em>after</em> the reboot.

<p>
This command honors <strong>–force</strong> and <strong>–when=</strong> in a similar way as <strong>halt</strong>.</p>

been set. If a new root file system has been set up on &#34;<em>run/nextroot</em>&#34;,
a <strong>soft-reboot</strong> will be performed instead of a reboot, unless
&#34;SYSTEMCTL_SKIP_AUTO_SOFT_REBOOT=1&#34; has been set.</p>
<p>
Added in version 246.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>kexec</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shut down and reboot the system via <strong>kexec</strong>. This command will load a
kexec kernel if one wasnt loaded yet or fail. A kernel may be loaded
earlier by a separate step, this is particularly useful if a custom
initrd or additional kernel command line options are desired. The
<strong>–force</strong> can be used to continue without a kexec kernel, i.e. to
perform a normal reboot. The final reboot step is equivalent to
<strong>systemctl start kexec.target –job-mode=replace-irreversibly
–no-block</strong>.</p>
<p>
To load a kernel, an enumeration is performed following the <strong>Boot Loader
Specification</strong>[1], and the default boot entry is loaded. For this step
to succeed, the system must be using UEFI and the boot loader entries
must be configured appropriately. <strong>bootctl list</strong> may be used to list
boot entries, see *bootctl*(1).</p>
<p>
This command is asynchronous; it will return after the reboot operation
is enqueued, without waiting for it to complete.</p>
<p>
This command honors <strong>–force</strong> and <strong>–when=</strong> similarly to <strong>halt</strong>.</p>
<p>
If a new kernel has been loaded via <strong>kexec –load</strong>, a <strong>kexec</strong> will be
performed when <strong>reboot</strong> is invoked, unless &#34;SYSTEMCTL_SKIP_AUTO_KEXEC=1&#34;
has been set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>soft-reboot</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shut down and reboot userspace. This is equivalent to <strong>systemctl start
soft-reboot.target –job-mode=replace-irreversibly –no-block</strong>. This

enqueued, without waiting for it to complete.</p>
<p>
This command honors <strong>–force</strong> and <strong>–when=</strong> in a similar way as <strong>halt</strong>.</p>
<p>
This operation only reboots userspace, leaving the kernel running. See
*systemd-soft-reboot.service*(8) for details.</p>

If a new root file system has been set up on &#34;<em>run/nextroot</em>&#34;, a
<strong>soft-reboot</strong> will be performed when <strong>reboot</strong> is invoked, unless

<strong>exit</strong> [/EXIT_CODE/]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ask the service manager to quit. This is only supported for user service
managers (i.e. in conjunction with the <strong>–user</strong> option) or in containers
and is equivalent to <strong>poweroff</strong> otherwise. This command is asynchronous;
it will return after the exit operation is enqueued, without waiting for
it to complete.</p>

The service manager will exit with the specified exit code, if
<em>EXIT_CODE</em> is passed.</p>

<p>
<strong>switch-root</strong> [/ROOT/ [/INIT/]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Switches to a different root directory and executes a new system manager
process below it. This is intended for use in the initrd, and will
transition from the initrds system manager process (a.k.a. &#34;init&#34;
process, PID 1) to the main system manager process which is loaded from
the actual host root files system. This call takes two arguments: the
directory that is to become the new root directory, and the path to the
new system manager binary below it to execute as PID 1. If both are
omitted or the former is an empty string it defaults to <em>sysroot</em>. If
the latter is omitted or is an empty string, a systemd binary will
automatically be searched for and used as service manager. If the system
manager path is omitted, equal to the empty string or identical to the
path to the systemd binary, the state of the initrds system manager
process is passed to the main system manager, which allows later
introspection of the state of the services involved in the initrd boot
phase.</p>

<p>
<strong>sleep</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Put the system to sleep, through <strong>suspend</strong>, <strong>hibernate</strong>, <strong>hybrid-sleep</strong>,
or <strong>suspend-then-hibernate</strong>. The sleep operation to use is automatically
selected by <strong>systemd-logind.service*(8). By default,
*suspend-then-hibernate</strong> is used, and falls back to <strong>suspend</strong> and then
<strong>hibernate</strong> if not supported. Refer to <em>SleepOperation=</em> setting in
*logind.conf*(5) for more details. This command is asynchronous, and
will return after the sleep operation is successfully enqueued. It will
not wait for the sleep/resume cycle to complete.</p>
<p>
Added in version 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>suspend</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suspend the system. This will trigger activation of the special target
unit suspend.target. This command is asynchronous, and will return after
the suspend operation is successfully enqueued. It will not wait for the
suspend/resume cycle to complete.</p>
<p>
If <strong>–force</strong> is specified, and <strong>systemd-logind</strong> returned error for the
operation, the error will be ignored and the operation will be tried
again directly through starting the target unit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>hibernate</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hibernate the system. This will trigger activation of the special target
unit hibernate.target. This command is asynchronous, and will return
after the hibernation operation is successfully enqueued. It will not
wait for the hibernate/thaw cycle to complete.</p>
<p>
This command honors <strong>–force</strong> in the same way as <strong>suspend</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>hybrid-sleep</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hibernate and suspend the system. This will trigger activation of the
special target unit hybrid-sleep.target. This command is asynchronous,
and will return after the hybrid sleep operation is successfully
enqueued. It will not wait for the sleep/wake-up cycle to complete.</p>
<p>
This command honors <strong>–force</strong> in the same way as <strong>suspend</strong>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>suspend-then-hibernate</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suspend the system and hibernate it when the battery is low, or when the
delay specified in systemd-sleep.conf elapsed. This will trigger
activation of the special target unit suspend-then-hibernate.target.
This command is asynchronous, and will return after the hybrid sleep
operation is successfully enqueued. It will not wait for the
sleep/wake-up or hibernate/thaw cycle to complete.</p>

Parameter Syntax
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Unit commands listed above take either a single unit name (designated as
<em>UNIT</em>), or multiple unit specifications (designated as <em>PATTERN</em>…).
In the first case, the unit name with or without a suffix must be given.
If the suffix is not specified (unit name is &#34;abbreviated&#34;), systemctl
will append a suitable suffix, &#34;.service&#34; by default, and a
type-specific suffix in case of commands which operate only on specific
unit types. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# systemctl start sshd
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
and</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# systemctl start sshd.service
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
are equivalent, as are</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# systemctl isolate default
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
and</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# systemctl isolate default.target
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that (absolute) paths to device nodes are automatically converted
to device unit names, and other (absolute) paths to mount unit names.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# systemctl status /dev/sda
# systemctl status /home
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
are equivalent to:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# systemctl status dev-sda.device
# systemctl status home.mount
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the second case, shell-style globs will be matched against the
primary names of all units currently in memory; literal unit names, with
or without a suffix, will be treated as in the first case. This means
that literal unit names always refer to exactly one unit, but globs may
match zero units and this is not considered an error.</p>
<p>
Glob patterns use <strong>fnmatch*(3), so normal shell-style globbing rules are
used, and &#34;</strong>&#34;, &#34;?&#34;, &#34;[]&#34; may be used. See *glob*(7) for more details.
The patterns are matched against the primary names of units currently in
memory, and patterns which do not match anything are silently skipped.
For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# systemctl stop &#34;sshd@*.service&#34;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
will stop all sshd@.service instances. Note that alias names of units,
and units that arent in memory are not considered for glob expansion.</p>
<p>
For unit file commands, the specified <em>UNIT</em> should be the name of the
unit file (possibly abbreviated, see above), or the absolute path to the
unit file:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# systemctl enable foo.service
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
or</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# systemctl link /path/to/foo.service
</pre>

<p>
<strong>–state=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The argument is a comma-separated list of unit LOAD, SUB, or ACTIVE
states. When listing units with <strong>list-units</strong>, <strong>list-dependencies</strong>,
<strong>show</strong> or <strong>status</strong>, show only those in the specified states. Use
<strong>–state=failed</strong> or <strong>–failed</strong> to show only failed units.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-p</strong>, <strong>–property=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When showing unit/job/manager properties with the <strong>show</strong> command, limit
display to properties specified in the argument. The argument should be
a comma-separated list of property names, such as &#34;MainPID&#34;. Unless
specified, all known properties are shown. If specified more than once,
all properties with the specified names are shown. Shell completion is
implemented for property names.</p>
<p>
For the manager itself, <strong>systemctl show</strong> will show all available
properties, most of which are derived or closely match the options
described in *systemd-system.conf*(5).</p>
<p>
Properties for units vary by unit type, so showing any unit (even a
non-existent one) is a way to list properties pertaining to this type.
Similarly, showing any job will list properties pertaining to all jobs.
Properties for units are documented in *systemd.unit*(5), and the pages
for individual unit types *systemd.service*(5), *systemd.socket*(5),
etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-P</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Equivalent to <strong>–value</strong> <strong>–property=</strong>, i.e. shows the value of the
property without the property name or &#34;=&#34;. Note that using <strong>-P</strong> once
will also affect all properties listed with <strong>-p*/</strong>–property=*.</p>
<p>
Added in version 246.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-a</strong>, <strong>–all</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When listing units with <strong>list-units</strong>, also show inactive units and units
which are following other units. When showing unit/job/manager
properties, show all properties regardless whether they are set or not.</p>
<p>
To list all units installed in the file system, use the
<strong>list-unit-files</strong> command instead.</p>
<p>
When listing units with <strong>list-dependencies</strong>, recursively show
dependencies of all dependent units (by default only dependencies of
target units are shown).</p>
<p>
When used with <strong>status</strong>, show journal messages in full, even if they
include unprintable characters or are very long. By default, fields with
unprintable characters are abbreviated as &#34;blob data&#34;. (Note that the
pager may escape unprintable characters again.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-r</strong>, <strong>–recursive</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When listing units, also show units of local containers. Units of local
containers will be prefixed with the container name, separated by a
single colon character (&#34;:&#34;).</p>
<p>
Added in version 212.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–reverse</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show reverse dependencies between units with <strong>list-dependencies</strong>, i.e.
follow dependencies of type <em>WantedBy=</em>, <em>RequiredBy=</em>, <em>UpheldBy=</em>,
<em>PartOf=</em>, <em>BoundBy=</em>, instead of <em>Wants=</em> and similar.</p>
<p>
Added in version 203.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–after</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With <strong>list-dependencies</strong>, show the units that are ordered before the
specified unit. In other words, recursively list units following the
<em>After=</em> dependency.</p>
<p>
Note that any <em>After=</em> dependency is automatically mirrored to create a
<em>Before=</em> dependency. Temporal dependencies may be specified explicitly,
but are also created implicitly for units which are <em>WantedBy=</em> targets
(see *systemd.target*(5)), and as a result of other directives (for
example <em>RequiresMountsFor=</em>). Both explicitly and implicitly introduced
dependencies are shown with <strong>list-dependencies</strong>.</p>
<p>
When passed to the <strong>list-jobs</strong> command, for each printed job show which
other jobs are waiting for it. May be combined with <strong>–before</strong> to show
both the jobs waiting for each job as well as all jobs each job is
waiting for.</p>

<strong>–job-mode=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When queuing a new job, this option controls how to deal with already
queued jobs. It takes one of &#34;fail&#34;, &#34;replace&#34;, &#34;replace-irreversibly&#34;,
&#34;isolate&#34;, &#34;ignore-dependencies&#34;, &#34;ignore-requirements&#34;, &#34;flush&#34;,
&#34;triggering&#34;, or &#34;restart-dependencies&#34;. Defaults to &#34;replace&#34;, except
when the <strong>isolate</strong> command is used which implies the &#34;isolate&#34; job mode.</p>
<p>
If &#34;fail&#34; is specified and a requested operation conflicts with a
pending job (more specifically: causes an already pending start job to
be reversed into a stop job or vice versa), cause the operation to fail.</p>
<p>
If &#34;replace&#34; (the default) is specified, any conflicting pending job
will be replaced, as necessary.</p>
<p>
If &#34;replace-irreversibly&#34; is specified, operate like &#34;replace&#34;, but also
mark the new jobs as irreversible. This prevents future conflicting
transactions from replacing these jobs (or even being enqueued while the
irreversible jobs are still pending). Irreversible jobs can still be
cancelled using the <strong>cancel</strong> command. This job mode should be used on
any transaction which pulls in shutdown.target.</p>
<p>
&#34;isolate&#34; is only valid for start operations and causes all other units
to be stopped when the specified unit is started. This mode is always
used when the <strong>isolate</strong> command is used.</p>
<p>
&#34;flush&#34; will cause all queued jobs to be canceled when the new job is
enqueued.</p>
<p>
If &#34;ignore-dependencies&#34; is specified, then all unit dependencies are
ignored for this new job and the operation is executed immediately. If
passed, no required units of the unit passed will be pulled in, and no
ordering dependencies will be honored. This is mostly a debugging and
rescue tool for the administrator and should not be used by
applications.</p>
<p>
&#34;ignore-requirements&#34; is similar to &#34;ignore-dependencies&#34;, but only
causes the requirement dependencies to be ignored, the ordering
dependencies will still be honored.</p>
<p>
&#34;triggering&#34; may only be used with <strong>systemctl stop</strong>. In this mode, the
specified unit and any active units that trigger it are stopped. See the
discussion of <em>Triggers=</em> in *systemd.unit*(5) for more information
about triggering units.</p>
<p>
&#34;restart-dependencies&#34; may only be used with <strong>systemctl start</strong>. In this
mode, dependencies of the specified unit will receive restart
propagation, as if a restart job had been enqueued for the unit.</p>

dependencies. Note that the output will only include jobs immediately
part of the transaction requested. It is possible that service start-up

jobs to be pulled in. This means that completion of the listed jobs
might ultimately entail more jobs than the listed ones.</p>

<strong>–check-inhibitors=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When system shutdown or sleep state is requested, this option controls
checking of inhibitor locks. It takes one of &#34;auto&#34;, &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;no&#34;.
Defaults to &#34;auto&#34;, which will behave like &#34;yes&#34; for interactive
invocations (i.e. from a TTY) and &#34;no&#34; for non-interactive invocations.
&#34;yes&#34; lets the request respect inhibitor locks. &#34;no&#34; lets the request
ignore inhibitor locks.</p>
<p>
Applications can establish inhibitor locks to prevent certain important
operations (such as CD burning) from being interrupted by system
shutdown or sleep. Any user may take these locks and privileged users
may override these locks. If any locks are taken, shutdown and sleep
state requests will normally fail (unless privileged). However, if &#34;no&#34;
is specified or &#34;auto&#34; is specified on a non-interactive requests, the
operation will be attempted. If locks are present, the operation may
require additional privileges.</p>

<strong>–kill-whom=</strong></p>

<p>When used with <strong>kill</strong>, choose which processes to send a UNIX process
signal to. Must be one of <strong>main</strong>, <strong>control</strong> or <strong>all</strong> to select whether
to kill only the main process, the control process or all processes of
the unit. The main process of the unit is the one that defines the
life-time of it. A control process of a unit is one that is invoked by
the manager to induce state changes of it. For example, all processes
started due to the <em>ExecStartPre=</em>, <em>ExecStop=</em> or <em>ExecReload=</em>
settings of service units are control processes. Note that there is only
one control process per unit at a time, as only one state change is
executed at a time. For services of type <em>Type=forking</em>, the initial
process started by the manager for <em>ExecStart=</em> is a control process,
while the process ultimately forked off by that one is then considered
the main process of the unit (if it can be determined). This is
different for service units of other types, where the process forked off
by the manager for <em>ExecStart=</em> is always the main process itself. A
service unit consists of zero or one main process, zero or one control
process plus any number of additional processes. Not all unit types
manage processes of these types however. For example, for mount units,
control processes are defined (which are the invocations of
/nix/store/s0gg4vga0a92cakdqbziz145ck89k60q-util-linux-minimal-2.39.4-mount/bin/mount

This option may be specified more than once, in which case all specified
resource types are removed. Also accepts the special value <strong>all</strong> as a
shortcut for specifying all six resource types. If this option is not
specified defaults to the combination of <strong>cache</strong>, <strong>runtime</strong> and
<strong>fdstore</strong>, i.e. the three kinds of resources that are generally
considered to be redundant and can be reconstructed on next invocation.
Note that the explicit removal of the <strong>fdstore</strong> resource type is only
useful if the <em>FileDescriptorStorePreserve=</em> option is enabled, since
the file descriptor store is otherwise cleaned automatically when the

When used with <strong>halt</strong>, <strong>poweroff</strong>, <strong>reboot</strong>, or <strong>kexec</strong>, execute the
selected operation without shutting down all units. However, all

immediately, without terminating any processes or unmounting any file
systems.</p>

<p>
The mapping of LSB service states to systemd unit states is imperfect,
so it is better to not rely on those return values but to look for
specific unit states and substates instead.</p>

ENVIRONMENT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-2">
<p><em>$SYSTEMD_EDITOR</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Editor to use when editing units; overrides <em>$EDITOR</em> and <em>$VISUAL</em>. If
neither <em>$SYSTEMD_EDITOR</em> nor <em>$EDITOR</em> nor <em>$VISUAL</em> are present or if
it is set to an empty string or if their execution failed, systemctl
will try to execute well known editors in this order: *editor*(1),
*nano*(1), *vim*(1), *vi*(1).</p>
<p>
Added in version 218.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a higher log
level, i.e. less important ones, will be suppressed). Takes a
comma-separated list of values. A value may be either one of (in order
of decreasing importance) <strong>emerg</strong>, <strong>alert</strong>, <strong>crit</strong>, <strong>err</strong>, <strong>warning</strong>,
<strong>notice</strong>, <strong>info</strong>, <strong>debug</strong>, or an integer in the range 0…7. See
<strong>syslog*(3) for more information. Each value may optionally be prefixed
with one of *console</strong>, <strong>syslog</strong>, <strong>kmsg</strong> or <strong>journal</strong> followed by a colon
to set the maximum log level for that specific log target (e.g.
<strong>SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug,console:info</strong> specifies to log at debug level
except when logging to the console which should be at info level). Note
that the global maximum log level takes priority over any per target
maximum log levels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be colored
according to priority.</p>
<p>
This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the
terminal, because *journalctl*(1) and other tools that display logs will
color messages based on the log level on their own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed with a
timestamp.</p>
<p>
This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the
terminal or a file, because *journalctl*(1) and other tools that display
logs will attach timestamps based on the entry metadata on their own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename and line
number in the source code where the message originates.</p>
<p>
Note that the log location is often attached as metadata to journal
entries anyway. Including it directly in the message text can
nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The destination for log messages. One of <strong>console</strong> (log to the attached
tty), <strong>console-prefixed</strong> (log to the attached tty but with prefixes
encoding the log level and &#34;facility&#34;, see <strong>syslog*(3), *kmsg</strong> (log to
the kernel circular log buffer), <strong>journal</strong> (log to the journal),
<strong>journal-or-kmsg</strong> (log to the journal if available, and to kmsg
otherwise), <strong>auto</strong> (determine the appropriate log target automatically,
the default), <strong>null</strong> (disable log output).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pager to use when <strong>–no-pager</strong> is not given; overrides <em>$PAGER</em>. If
neither <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</em> nor <em>$PAGER</em> are set, a set of well-known pager
implementations are tried in turn, including *less*(1) and *more*(1),
until one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is
invoked. Setting this environment variable to an empty string or the
value &#34;cat&#34; is equivalent to passing <strong>–no-pager</strong>.</p>
<p>
Note: if <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em> is not set, <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</em> (as well as
<em>$PAGER</em>) will be silently ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LESS</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Override the options passed to <strong>less</strong> (by default &#34;FRSXMK&#34;).</p>
<p>
Users might want to change two options in particular:</p>
<p>
<strong>K</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when Ctrl+C is
pressed. To allow <strong>less</strong> to handle Ctrl+C itself to switch back to the
pager command prompt, unset this option.</p>
<p>
If the value of <em>$SYSTEMD_LESS</em> does not include &#34;K&#34;, and the pager that
is invoked is <strong>less</strong>, Ctrl+C will be ignored by the executable, and
needs to be handled by the pager.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>X</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option instructs the pager to not send termcap initialization and
deinitialization strings to the terminal. It is set by default to allow
command output to remain visible in the terminal even after the pager
exits. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager functionality from
working, in particular paged output cannot be scrolled with the mouse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that setting the regular <em>$LESS</em> environment variable has no effect
for <strong>less</strong> invocations by systemd tools.</p>
<p>
See *less*(1) for more discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Override the charset passed to <strong>less</strong> (by default &#34;utf-8&#34;, if the
invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).</p>
<p>
Note that setting the regular <em>$LESSCHARSET</em> environment variable has no
effect for <strong>less</strong> invocations by systemd tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument. When true, the &#34;secure&#34; mode of the pager is
enabled; if false, disabled. If <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em> is not set at
all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the
owner of the login session, see <strong>geteuid*(2) and
*sd_pid_get_owner_uid*(3). In secure mode, *LESSSECURE=1</strong> will be set
when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open
or create new files or start new subprocesses. When
<em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em> is not set at all, pagers which are not known to
implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only *less*(1)
implements secure mode.)</p>
<p>
Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for example
under *sudo*(8) or *pkexec*(1), care must be taken to ensure that
unintended interactive features are not enabled. &#34;Secure&#34; mode for the
pager may be enabled automatically as describe above. Setting
<em>SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0</em> or not removing it from the inherited
environment allows the user to invoke arbitrary commands. Note that if
the <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</em> or <em>$PAGER</em> variables are to be honoured,
<em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em> must be set too. It might be reasonable to
completely disable the pager using <strong>–no-pager</strong> instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_COLORS</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument. When true, <strong>systemd</strong> and related utilities
will use colors in their output, otherwise the output will be
monochrome. Additionally, the variable can take one of the following
special values: &#34;16&#34;, &#34;256&#34; to restrict the use of colors to the base 16
or 256 ANSI colors, respectively. This can be specified to override the
automatic decision based on <em>$TERM</em> and what the console is connected
to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_URLIFY</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should be
generated in the output for terminal emulators supporting this. This can
be specified to override the decision that <strong>systemd</strong> makes based on
<em>$TERM</em> and other conditions.</p>
