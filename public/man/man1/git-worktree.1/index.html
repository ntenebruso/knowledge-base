DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Manage multiple working trees attached to the same repository.</p>
<p>
A git repository can support multiple working trees, allowing you to
check out more than one branch at a time. With <strong>git worktree add</strong> a new
working tree is associated with the repository, along with additional
metadata that differentiates that working tree from others in the same
repository. The working tree, along with this metadata, is called a
&#34;worktree&#34;.</p>
<p>
This new worktree is called a &#34;linked worktree&#34; as opposed to the &#34;main
worktree&#34; prepared by *git-init*(1) or *git-clone*(1). A repository has
one main worktree (if it&#39;s not a bare repository) and zero or more
linked worktrees. When you are done with a linked worktree, remove it
with <strong>git worktree remove</strong>.</p>
<p>
In its simplest form, <strong>git worktree add &lt;path&gt;</strong> automatically creates a
new branch whose name is the final component of <strong>&lt;path&gt;</strong>, which is
convenient if you plan to work on a new topic. For instance, <strong>git
worktree add ../hotfix</strong> creates new branch <strong>hotfix</strong> and checks it out at
path <strong>../hotfix</strong>. To instead work on an existing branch in a new
worktree, use <strong>git worktree add &lt;path&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</strong>. On the other hand, if
you just plan to make some experimental changes or do testing without
disturbing existing development, it is often convenient to create a
<em>throwaway</em> worktree not associated with any branch. For instance, <strong>git
worktree add -d &lt;path&gt;</strong> creates a new worktree with a detached <strong>HEAD</strong> at
the same commit as the current branch.</p>
<p>
If a working tree is deleted without using <strong>git worktree remove</strong>, then
its associated administrative files, which reside in the repository (see
&#34;DETAILS&#34; below), will eventually be removed automatically (see
<strong>gc.worktreePruneExpire</strong> in <strong>git-config*(1)), or you can run *git
worktree prune</strong> in the main or any linked worktree to clean up any stale
administrative files.</p>
<p>
If the working tree for a linked worktree is stored on a portable device
or network share which is not always mounted, you can prevent its
administrative files from being pruned by issuing the <strong>git worktree
lock</strong> command, optionally specifying <strong>–reason</strong> to explain why the
worktree is locked.</p>

COMMANDS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>add &lt;path&gt; [&lt;commit-ish&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a worktree at <strong>&lt;path&gt;</strong> and checkout <strong>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</strong> into it. The
new worktree is linked to the current repository, sharing everything
except per-worktree files such as <strong>HEAD</strong>, <strong>index</strong>, etc. As a
convenience, <strong>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</strong> may be a bare &#34;<strong>-</strong>&#34;, which is synonymous
with <strong>@{-1}</strong>.</p>
<p>
If <strong>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</strong> is a branch name (call it <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong>) and is not
found, and neither <strong>-b</strong> nor <strong>-B</strong> nor <strong>–detach</strong> are used, but there does
exist a tracking branch in exactly one remote (call it <strong>&lt;remote&gt;</strong>) with
a matching name, treat as equivalent to:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git worktree add --track -b &lt;branch&gt; &lt;path&gt; &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If the branch exists in multiple remotes and one of them is named by the
<strong>checkout.defaultRemote</strong> configuration variable, we&#39;ll use that one for
the purposes of disambiguation, even if the <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong> isn&#39;t unique
across all remotes. Set it to e.g. <strong>checkout.defaultRemote=origin</strong> to
always checkout remote branches from there if <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong> is ambiguous
but exists on the <strong>origin</strong> remote. See also <strong>checkout.defaultRemote</strong> in
*git-config*(1).</p>
<p>
If <strong>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</strong> is omitted and neither <strong>-b</strong> nor <strong>-B</strong> nor <strong>–detach</strong>
used, then, as a convenience, the new worktree is associated with a
branch (call it <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong>) named after <strong>$(basename &lt;path&gt;)</strong>. If
<strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong> doesn&#39;t exist, a new branch based on <strong>HEAD</strong> is automatically
created as if <strong>-b &lt;branch&gt;</strong> was given. If <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong> does exist, it will
be checked out in the new worktree, if it&#39;s not checked out anywhere
else, otherwise the command will refuse to create the worktree (unless
<strong>–force</strong> is used).</p>
<p>
If <strong>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</strong> is omitted, neither <strong>–detach</strong>, or <strong>–orphan</strong> is used,
and there are no valid local branches (or remote branches if
<strong>–guess-remote</strong> is specified) then, as a convenience, the new worktree
is associated with a new unborn branch named <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong> (after
<strong>$(basename &lt;path&gt;)</strong> if neither <strong>-b</strong> or <strong>-B</strong> is used) as if <strong>–orphan</strong>
was passed to the command. In the event the repository has a remote and
<strong>–guess-remote</strong> is used, but no remote or local branches exist, then
the command fails with a warning reminding the user to fetch from their
remote first (or override by using <strong>-f/–force</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
list</p>
<blockquote>
<p>List details of each worktree. The main worktree is listed first,
followed by each of the linked worktrees. The output details include
whether the worktree is bare, the revision currently checked out, the
branch currently checked out (or &#34;detached HEAD&#34; if none), &#34;locked&#34; if
the worktree is locked, &#34;prunable&#34; if the worktree can be pruned by the
<strong>prune</strong> command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
lock</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a worktree is on a portable device or network share which is not
always mounted, lock it to prevent its administrative files from being
pruned automatically. This also prevents it from being moved or deleted.
Optionally, specify a reason for the lock with <strong>–reason</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
move</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Move a worktree to a new location. Note that the main worktree or linked
worktrees containing submodules cannot be moved with this command. (The
<strong>git worktree repair</strong> command, however, can reestablish the connection
with linked worktrees if you move the main worktree manually.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
prune</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prune worktree information in <strong>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
remove</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remove a worktree. Only clean worktrees (no untracked files and no
modification in tracked files) can be removed. Unclean worktrees or ones
with submodules can be removed with <strong>–force</strong>. The main worktree cannot
be removed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
repair [&lt;path&gt;…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Repair worktree administrative files, if possible, if they have become
corrupted or outdated due to external factors.</p>
<p>
For instance, if the main worktree (or bare repository) is moved, linked
worktrees will be unable to locate it. Running <strong>repair</strong> in the main
worktree will reestablish the connection from linked worktrees back to
the main worktree.</p>
<p>
Similarly, if the working tree for a linked worktree is moved without
using <strong>git worktree move</strong>, the main worktree (or bare repository) will
be unable to locate it. Running <strong>repair</strong> within the recently-moved
worktree will reestablish the connection. If multiple linked worktrees
are moved, running <strong>repair</strong> from any worktree with each tree&#39;s new
<strong>&lt;path&gt;</strong> as an argument, will reestablish the connection to all the
specified paths.</p>
<p>
If both the main worktree and linked worktrees have been moved manually,
then running <strong>repair</strong> in the main worktree and specifying the new
<strong>&lt;path&gt;</strong> of each linked worktree will reestablish all connections in
both directions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
unlock</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlock a worktree, allowing it to be pruned, moved or deleted.</p>

<h2 id="headline-5">
OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>-f, –force</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, <strong>add</strong> refuses to create a new worktree when <strong>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</strong>
is a branch name and is already checked out by another worktree, or if
<strong>&lt;path&gt;</strong> is already assigned to some worktree but is missing (for
instance, if <strong>&lt;path&gt;</strong> was deleted manually). This option overrides these
safeguards. To add a missing but locked worktree path, specify <strong>–force</strong>
twice.</p>
<p>
<strong>move</strong> refuses to move a locked worktree unless <strong>–force</strong> is specified
twice. If the destination is already assigned to some other worktree but
is missing (for instance, if <strong>&lt;new-path&gt;</strong> was deleted manually), then
<strong>–force</strong> allows the move to proceed; use <strong>–force</strong> twice if the
destination is locked.</p>
<p>
<strong>remove</strong> refuses to remove an unclean worktree unless <strong>–force</strong> is used.
To remove a locked worktree, specify <strong>–force</strong> twice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-b &lt;new-branch&gt;, -B &lt;new-branch&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With <strong>add</strong>, create a new branch named <strong>&lt;new-branch&gt;</strong> starting at
<strong>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</strong>, and check out <strong>&lt;new-branch&gt;</strong> into the new worktree. If
<strong>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</strong> is omitted, it defaults to <strong>HEAD</strong>. By default, <strong>-b</strong>
refuses to create a new branch if it already exists. <strong>-B</strong> overrides this
safeguard, resetting <strong>&lt;new-branch&gt;</strong> to <strong>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-d, –detach</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With <strong>add</strong>, detach <strong>HEAD</strong> in the new worktree. See &#34;DETACHED HEAD&#34; in
*git-checkout*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]checkout</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, <strong>add</strong> checks out <strong>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</strong>, however, <strong>–no-checkout</strong>
can be used to suppress checkout in order to make customizations, such
as configuring sparse-checkout. See &#34;Sparse checkout&#34; in
*git-read-tree*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]guess-remote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With <strong>worktree add &lt;path&gt;</strong>, without <strong>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</strong>, instead of creating
a new branch from <strong>HEAD</strong>, if there exists a tracking branch in exactly
one remote matching the basename of <strong>&lt;path&gt;</strong>, base the new branch on the
remote-tracking branch, and mark the remote-tracking branch as
&#34;upstream&#34; from the new branch.</p>
<p>
This can also be set up as the default behaviour by using the
<strong>worktree.guessRemote</strong> config option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]track</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When creating a new branch, if <strong>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</strong> is a branch, mark it as
&#34;upstream&#34; from the new branch. This is the default if <strong>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</strong> is
a remote-tracking branch. See <strong>–track</strong> in *git-branch*(1) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–lock</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep the worktree locked after creation. This is the equivalent of <strong>git
worktree lock</strong> after <strong>git worktree add</strong>, but without a race condition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-n, –dry-run</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With <strong>prune</strong>, do not remove anything; just report what it would remove.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–orphan</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With <strong>add</strong>, make the new worktree and index empty, associating the
worktree with a new unborn branch named <strong>&lt;new-branch&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–porcelain</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With <strong>list</strong>, output in an easy-to-parse format for scripts. This format
will remain stable across Git versions and regardless of user
configuration. It is recommended to combine this with <strong>-z</strong>. See below
for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-z</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Terminate each line with a NUL rather than a newline when <strong>–porcelain</strong>
is specified with <strong>list</strong>. This makes it possible to parse the output
when a worktree path contains a newline character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-q, –quiet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With <strong>add</strong>, suppress feedback messages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-v, –verbose</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With <strong>prune</strong>, report all removals.</p>
<p>
With <strong>list</strong>, output additional information about worktrees (see below).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–expire &lt;time&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With <strong>prune</strong>, only expire unused worktrees older than <strong>&lt;time&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>
With <strong>list</strong>, annotate missing worktrees as prunable if they are older
than <strong>&lt;time&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–reason &lt;string&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With <strong>lock</strong> or with <strong>add –lock</strong>, an explanation why the worktree is
locked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;worktree&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Worktrees can be identified by path, either relative or absolute.</p>
<p>
If the last path components in the worktree&#39;s path is unique among
worktrees, it can be used to identify a worktree. For example if you
only have two worktrees, at <strong>/abc/def/ghi</strong> and <strong>/abc/def/ggg</strong>, then
<strong>ghi</strong> or <strong>def/ghi</strong> is enough to point to the former worktree.</p>

REFS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When using multiple worktrees, some refs are shared between all
worktrees, but others are specific to an individual worktree. One
example is <strong>HEAD</strong>, which is different for each worktree. This section is
about the sharing rules and how to access refs of one worktree from
another.</p>
<p>
In general, all pseudo refs are per-worktree and all refs starting with
<strong>refs/</strong> are shared. Pseudo refs are ones like <strong>HEAD</strong> which are directly
under <strong>$GIT_DIR</strong> instead of inside <strong>$GIT_DIR/refs</strong>. There are
exceptions, however: refs inside <strong>refs/bisect</strong>, <strong>refs/worktree</strong> and
<strong>refs/rewritten</strong> are not shared.</p>
<p>
Refs that are per-worktree can still be accessed from another worktree
via two special paths, <strong>main-worktree</strong> and <strong>worktrees</strong>. The former gives
access to per-worktree refs of the main worktree, while the latter to
all linked worktrees.</p>
<p>
For example, <strong>main-worktree/HEAD</strong> or <strong>main-worktree/refs/bisect/good</strong>
resolve to the same value as the main worktree&#39;s <strong>HEAD</strong> and
<strong>refs/bisect/good</strong> respectively. Similarly, <strong>worktrees/foo/HEAD</strong> or
<strong>worktrees/bar/refs/bisect/bad</strong> are the same as
<strong>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/foo/HEAD</strong> and
<strong>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/bar/refs/bisect/bad</strong>.</p>
<p>
To access refs, it&#39;s best not to look inside <strong>$GIT_DIR</strong> directly.
Instead use commands such as *git-rev-parse*(1) or *git-update-ref*(1)
which will handle refs correctly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-7">
CONFIGURATION FILE
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>By default, the repository <strong>config</strong> file is shared across all worktrees.
If the config variables <strong>core.bare</strong> or <strong>core.worktree</strong> are present in
the common config file and <strong>extensions.worktreeConfig</strong> is disabled, then
they will be applied to the main worktree only.</p>
<p>
In order to have worktree-specific configuration, you can turn on the
<strong>worktreeConfig</strong> extension, e.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git config extensions.worktreeConfig true
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In this mode, specific configuration stays in the path pointed by <strong>git
rev-parse –git-path config.worktree</strong>. You can add or update
configuration in this file with <strong>git config –worktree</strong>. Older Git
versions will refuse to access repositories with this extension.</p>
<p>
Note that in this file, the exception for <strong>core.bare</strong> and
<strong>core.worktree</strong> is gone. If they exist in <strong>$GIT_DIR/config</strong>, you must
move them to the <strong>config.worktree</strong> of the main worktree. You may also
take this opportunity to review and move other configuration that you do
not want to share to all worktrees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>core.worktree</strong> should never be shared.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>core.bare</strong> should not be shared if the value is <strong>core.bare=true</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>core.sparseCheckout</strong> should not be shared, unless you are sure you
always use sparse checkout for all worktrees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
See the documentation of <strong>extensions.worktreeConfig</strong> in *git-config*(1)
for more details.</p>

<h2 id="headline-8">
DETAILS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Each linked worktree has a private sub-directory in the repository&#39;s
<strong>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</strong> directory. The private sub-directory&#39;s name is
usually the base name of the linked worktree&#39;s path, possibly appended
with a number to make it unique. For example, when
<strong>$GIT_DIR=/path/main/.git</strong> the command <strong>git worktree add
/path/other/test-next next</strong> creates the linked worktree in
<strong>/path/other/test-next</strong> and also creates a
<strong>$GIT_DIR/worktrees/test-next</strong> directory (or
<strong>$GIT_DIR/worktrees/test-next1</strong> if <strong>test-next</strong> is already taken).</p>
<p>
Within a linked worktree, <strong>$GIT_DIR</strong> is set to point to this private
directory (e.g. <strong><em>path/main</em>.git/worktrees/test-next</strong> in the example)
and <strong>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</strong> is set to point back to the main worktree&#39;s
<strong>$GIT_DIR</strong> (e.g. <strong><em>path/main</em>.git</strong>). These settings are made in a <strong>.git</strong>
file located at the top directory of the linked worktree.</p>
<p>
Path resolution via <strong>git rev-parse –git-path</strong> uses either <strong>$GIT_DIR</strong> or
<strong>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</strong> depending on the path. For example, in the linked
worktree <strong>git rev-parse –git-path HEAD</strong> returns
<strong><em>path/main</em>.git/worktrees/test-next/HEAD</strong> (not
<strong><em>path/other/test-next</em>.git/HEAD</strong> or <strong><em>path/main</em>.git/HEAD</strong>) while <strong>git
rev-parse –git-path refs/heads/master</strong> uses <strong>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</strong> and
returns <strong><em>path/main</em>.git/refs/heads/master</strong>, since refs are shared
across all worktrees, except <strong>refs/bisect</strong>, <strong>refs/worktree</strong> and
<strong>refs/rewritten</strong>.</p>
<p>
See <strong>gitrepository-layout*(5) for more information. The rule of thumb is
do not make any assumption about whether a path belongs to *$GIT_DIR</strong> or
<strong>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</strong> when you need to directly access something inside
<strong>$GIT_DIR</strong>. Use <strong>git rev-parse –git-path</strong> to get the final path.</p>
<p>
If you manually move a linked worktree, you need to update the <strong>gitdir</strong>
file in the entry&#39;s directory. For example, if a linked worktree is
moved to <strong>/newpath/test-next</strong> and its <strong>.git</strong> file points to
<strong><em>path/main</em>.git/worktrees/test-next</strong>, then update
<strong><em>path/main</em>.git/worktrees/test-next/gitdir</strong> to reference
<strong>/newpath/test-next</strong> instead. Better yet, run <strong>git worktree repair</strong> to
reestablish the connection automatically.</p>
<p>
To prevent a <strong>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</strong> entry from being pruned (which can be
useful in some situations, such as when the entry&#39;s worktree is stored
on a portable device), use the <strong>git worktree lock</strong> command, which adds a
file named <strong>locked</strong> to the entry&#39;s directory. The file contains the
reason in plain text. For example, if a linked worktree&#39;s <strong>.git</strong> file
points to <strong><em>path/main</em>.git/worktrees/test-next</strong> then a file named
<strong><em>path/main</em>.git/worktrees/test-next/locked</strong> will prevent the
<strong>test-next</strong> entry from being pruned. See *gitrepository-layout*(5) for
details.</p>
<p>
When <strong>extensions.worktreeConfig</strong> is enabled, the config file
<strong>.git/worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/config.worktree</strong> is read after <strong>.git/config</strong> is.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-9">
LIST OUTPUT FORMAT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The <strong>worktree list</strong> command has two output formats. The default format
shows the details on a single line with columns. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git worktree list
/path/to/bare-source            (bare)
/path/to/linked-worktree        abcd1234 [master]
/path/to/other-linked-worktree  1234abc  (detached HEAD)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The command also shows annotations for each worktree, according to its
state. These annotations are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>locked</strong>, if the worktree is locked.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>prunable</strong>, if the worktree can be pruned via <strong>git worktree prune</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git worktree list
/path/to/linked-worktree    abcd1234 [master]
/path/to/locked-worktree    acbd5678 (brancha) locked
/path/to/prunable-worktree  5678abc  (detached HEAD) prunable
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
For these annotations, a reason might also be available and this can be
seen using the verbose mode. The annotation is then moved to the next
line indented followed by the additional information.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git worktree list --verbose
/path/to/linked-worktree              abcd1234 [master]
/path/to/locked-worktree-no-reason    abcd5678 (detached HEAD) locked
/path/to/locked-worktree-with-reason  1234abcd (brancha)
        locked: worktree path is mounted on a portable device
/path/to/prunable-worktree            5678abc1 (detached HEAD)
        prunable: gitdir file points to non-existent location
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that the annotation is moved to the next line if the additional
information is available, otherwise it stays on the same line as the
worktree itself.</p>

listed with a label and value separated by a single space. Boolean
attributes (like <strong>bare</strong> and <strong>detached</strong>) are listed as a label only, and
are present only if the value is true. Some attributes (like <strong>locked</strong>)
can be listed as a label only or with a value depending upon whether a
reason is available. The first attribute of a worktree is always
<strong>worktree</strong>, an empty line indicates the end of the record. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git worktree list --porcelain
worktree /path/to/bare-source
bare

worktree /path/to/linked-worktree
HEAD abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234
branch refs/heads/master

worktree /path/to/other-linked-worktree
HEAD 1234abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234a
detached

worktree /path/to/linked-worktree-locked-no-reason
HEAD 5678abc5678abc5678abc5678abc5678abc5678c
branch refs/heads/locked-no-reason
locked

worktree /path/to/linked-worktree-locked-with-reason
HEAD 3456def3456def3456def3456def3456def3456b
branch refs/heads/locked-with-reason
locked reason why is locked

worktree /path/to/linked-worktree-prunable

Unless <strong>-z</strong> is used any &#34;unusual&#34; characters in the lock reason such as
newlines are escaped and the entire reason is quoted as explained for
the configuration variable <strong>core.quotePath</strong> (see *git-config*(1)). For
Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git worktree list --porcelain
...
locked &#34;reason\nwhy is locked&#34;

EXAMPLES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-2">
<p>You are in the middle of a refactoring session and your boss comes in
and demands that you fix something immediately. You might typically use
*git-stash*(1) to store your changes away temporarily, however, your
working tree is in such a state of disarray (with new, moved, and
removed files, and other bits and pieces strewn around) that you don&#39;t
want to risk disturbing any of it. Instead, you create a temporary
linked worktree to make the emergency fix, remove it when done, and then
resume your earlier refactoring session.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git worktree add -b emergency-fix ../temp master
$ pushd ../temp
# ... hack hack hack ...
$ git commit -a -m emergency fix for boss
$ popd
$ git worktree remove ../temp
</pre>
