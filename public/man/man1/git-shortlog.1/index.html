DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Summarizes <em>git log</em> output in a format suitable for inclusion in
release announcements. Each commit will be grouped by author and title.</p>
<p>
Additionally, &#34;[PATCH]&#34; will be stripped from the commit description.</p>
<p>
If no revisions are passed on the command line and either standard input
is not a terminal or there is no current branch, <em>git shortlog</em> will
output a summary of the log read from standard input, without reference
to the current repository.</p>

<h2 id="headline-4">
OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>-n, –numbered</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sort output according to the number of commits per author instead of
author alphabetic order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-s, –summary</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppress commit description and provide a commit count summary only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-e, –email</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the email address of each author.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–format[=&lt;format&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of the commit subject, use some other information to describe
each commit. <em>&lt;format&gt;</em> can be any string accepted by the <strong>–format</strong>
option of <em>git log</em>, such as <em>* [%h] %s</em>. (See the &#34;PRETTY FORMATS&#34;
section of *git-log*(1).)</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
Each pretty-printed commit will be rewrapped before it is shown.
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
–date=&lt;format&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show dates formatted according to the given date string. (See the
<strong>–date</strong> option in the &#34;Commit Formatting&#34; section of <strong>git-log*(1)).
Useful with *–group=format:&lt;format&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–group=&lt;type&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Group commits based on <strong>&lt;type&gt;</strong>. If no <strong>–group</strong> option is specified,
the default is <strong>author</strong>. <strong>&lt;type&gt;</strong> is one of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>author</strong>, commits are grouped by author</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>committer</strong>, commits are grouped by committer (the same as <strong>-c</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>trailer:&lt;field&gt;</strong>, the <strong>&lt;field&gt;</strong> is interpreted as a case-insensitive
commit message trailer (see <strong>git-interpret-trailers*(1)). For example,
if your project uses *Reviewed-by</strong> trailers, you might want to see who
has been reviewing with <strong>git shortlog -ns –group=trailer:reviewed-by</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>format:&lt;format&gt;</strong>, any string accepted by the <strong>–format</strong> option of <em>git
log</em>. (See the &#34;PRETTY FORMATS&#34; section of *git-log*(1).)</p>
<p>
Note that commits that do not include the trailer will not be counted.
Likewise, commits with multiple trailers (e.g., multiple signoffs) may
be counted more than once (but only once per unique trailer value in
that commit).</p>
<p>
Shortlog will attempt to parse each trailer value as a <strong>name &lt;email&gt;</strong>
identity. If successful, the mailmap is applied and the email is omitted
unless the <strong>–email</strong> option is specified. If the value cannot be parsed
as an identity, it will be taken literally and completely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If <strong>–group</strong> is specified multiple times, commits are counted under each
value (but again, only once per unique value in that commit). For
example, <strong>git shortlog –group=author –group=trailer:co-authored-by</strong>
counts both authors and co-authors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-c, –committer</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an alias for <strong>–group=committer</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-w[&lt;width&gt;[,&lt;indent1&gt;[,&lt;indent2&gt;]]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linewrap the output by wrapping each line at <strong>width</strong>. The first line of
each entry is indented by <strong>indent1</strong> spaces, and the second and
subsequent lines are indented by <strong>indent2</strong> spaces. <strong>width</strong>, <strong>indent1</strong>,
and <strong>indent2</strong> default to 76, 6 and 9 respectively.</p>
<p>
If width is <strong>0</strong> (zero) then indent the lines of the output without
wrapping them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;revision-range&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show only commits in the specified revision range. When no
&lt;revision-range&gt; is specified, it defaults to <strong>HEAD</strong> (i.e. the whole
history leading to the current commit). <strong>origin..HEAD</strong> specifies all the
commits reachable from the current commit (i.e. <strong>HEAD</strong>), but not from
<strong>origin</strong>. For a complete list of ways to spell &lt;revision-range&gt;, see the
&#34;Specifying Ranges&#34; section of *gitrevisions*(7).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
[–] &lt;path&gt;…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider only commits that are enough to explain how the files that
match the specified paths came to be.</p>
<p>
Paths may need to be prefixed with <strong>–</strong> to separate them from options or
the revision range, when confusion arises.</p>

Commit Limiting
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the
special notations explained in the description, additional commit
limiting may be applied.</p>
<p>
Using more options generally further limits the output (e.g.
<strong>–since=&lt;date1&gt;</strong> limits to commits newer than <strong>&lt;date1&gt;</strong>, and using it
with <strong>–grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</strong> further limits to commits whose log message has
a line that matches <strong>&lt;pattern&gt;</strong>), unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>
Note that these are applied before commit ordering and formatting
options, such as <strong>–reverse</strong>.</p>
<p>
-&lt;number&gt;, -n &lt;number&gt;, –max-count=&lt;number&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the number of commits to output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–skip=&lt;number&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Skip <em>number</em> commits before starting to show the commit output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–since=&lt;date&gt;, –after=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show commits more recent than a specific date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–since-as-filter=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show all commits more recent than a specific date. This visits all
commits in the range, rather than stopping at the first commit which is
older than a specific date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–until=&lt;date&gt;, –before=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show commits older than a specific date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–author=&lt;pattern&gt;, –committer=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header lines that
match the specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
<strong>–author=&lt;pattern&gt;</strong>, commits whose author matches any of the given
patterns are chosen (similarly for multiple <strong>–committer=&lt;pattern&gt;</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–grep-reflog=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the commits output to ones with reflog entries that match the
specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
<strong>–grep-reflog</strong>, commits whose reflog message matches any of the given
patterns are chosen. It is an error to use this option unless
<strong>–walk-reflogs</strong> is in use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the commits output to ones with a log message that matches the
specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
<strong>–grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</strong>, commits whose message matches any of the given
patterns are chosen (but see <strong>–all-match</strong>).</p>
<p>
When <strong>–notes</strong> is in effect, the message from the notes is matched as if
it were part of the log message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–all-match</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the commits output to ones that match all given <strong>–grep</strong>, instead
of ones that match at least one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–invert-grep</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the commits output to ones with a log message that do not match
the pattern specified with <strong>–grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-i, –regexp-ignore-case</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Match the regular expression limiting patterns without regard to letter
case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–basic-regexp</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the limiting patterns to be basic regular expressions; this is
the default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-E, –extended-regexp</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular expressions
instead of the default basic regular expressions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-F, –fixed-strings</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings (don&#39;t interpret
pattern as a regular expression).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-P, –perl-regexp</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the limiting patterns to be Perl-compatible regular
expressions.</p>
<p>
Support for these types of regular expressions is an optional
compile-time dependency. If Git wasn&#39;t compiled with support for them
providing this option will cause it to die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–remove-empty</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop when a given path disappears from the tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–merges</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print only merge commits. This is exactly the same as <strong>–min-parents=2</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-merges</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not print commits with more than one parent. This is exactly the same
as <strong>–max-parents=1</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–min-parents=&lt;number&gt;, –max-parents=&lt;number&gt;, –no-min-parents,
–no-max-parents</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show only commits which have at least (or at most) that many parent
commits. In particular, <strong>–max-parents=1</strong> is the same as <strong>–no-merges</strong>,
<strong>–min-parents=2</strong> is the same as <strong>–merges</strong>. <strong>–max-parents=0</strong> gives all
root commits and <strong>–min-parents=3</strong> all octopus merges.</p>
<p>
<strong>–no-min-parents</strong> and <strong>–no-max-parents</strong> reset these limits (to no
limit) again. Equivalent forms are <strong>–min-parents=0</strong> (any commit has 0
or more parents) and <strong>–max-parents=-1</strong> (negative numbers denote no
upper limit).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–first-parent</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When finding commits to include, follow only the first parent commit
upon seeing a merge commit. This option can give a better overview when
viewing the evolution of a particular topic branch, because merges into
a topic branch tend to be only about adjusting to updated upstream from
time to time, and this option allows you to ignore the individual
commits brought in to your history by such a merge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–exclude-first-parent-only</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When finding commits to exclude (with a <em>^</em>), follow only the first
parent commit upon seeing a merge commit. This can be used to find the
set of changes in a topic branch from the point where it diverged from
the remote branch, given that arbitrary merges can be valid topic branch
changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–not</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reverses the meaning of the <em>^</em> prefix (or lack thereof) for all
following revision specifiers, up to the next <strong>–not</strong>. When used on the
command line before –stdin, the revisions passed through stdin will not
be affected by it. Conversely, when passed via standard input, the
revisions passed on the command line will not be affected by it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–all</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all the refs in <strong>refs/</strong>, along with <strong>HEAD</strong>, are listed on
the command line as <em>&lt;commit&gt;</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–branches[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all the refs in <strong>refs/heads</strong> are listed on the command
line as <em>&lt;commit&gt;</em>. If <em>&lt;pattern&gt;</em> is given, limit branches to ones
matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks <em>?</em>, <em>*</em>, or <em>[</em>, <em>/*</em> at
the end is implied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–tags[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all the refs in <strong>refs/tags</strong> are listed on the command line
as <em>&lt;commit&gt;</em>. If <em>&lt;pattern&gt;</em> is given, limit tags to ones matching
given shell glob. If pattern lacks <em>?</em>, <em>*</em>, or <em>[</em>, <em>/*</em> at the end is
implied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–remotes[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all the refs in <strong>refs/remotes</strong> are listed on the command
line as <em>&lt;commit&gt;</em>. If <em>&lt;pattern&gt;</em> is given, limit remote-tracking
branches to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks <em>?</em>, <em>*</em>,
or <em>[</em>, <em>/*</em> at the end is implied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–glob=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all the refs matching shell glob <em>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</em> are
listed on the command line as <em>&lt;commit&gt;</em>. Leading <em>refs/</em>, is
automatically prepended if missing. If pattern lacks <em>?</em>, <em>*</em>, or <em>[</em>,
<em>/*</em> at the end is implied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–exclude=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not include refs matching <em>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</em> that the next <strong>–all</strong>,
<strong>–branches</strong>, <strong>–tags</strong>, <strong>–remotes</strong>, or <strong>–glob</strong> would otherwise
consider. Repetitions of this option accumulate exclusion patterns up to
the next <strong>–all</strong>, <strong>–branches</strong>, <strong>–tags</strong>, <strong>–remotes</strong>, or <strong>–glob</strong>
option (other options or arguments do not clear accumulated patterns).</p>
<p>
The patterns given should not begin with <strong>refs/heads</strong>, <strong>refs/tags</strong>, or
<strong>refs/remotes</strong> when applied to <strong>–branches</strong>, <strong>–tags</strong>, or <strong>–remotes</strong>,
respectively, and they must begin with <strong>refs/</strong> when applied to <strong>–glob</strong>
or <strong>–all</strong>. If a trailing <em>/*</em> is intended, it must be given explicitly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–exclude-hidden=[fetch|receive|uploadpack]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not include refs that would be hidden by <strong>git-fetch</strong>,
<strong>git-receive-pack</strong> or <strong>git-upload-pack</strong> by consulting the appropriate
<strong>fetch.hideRefs</strong>, <strong>receive.hideRefs</strong> or <strong>uploadpack.hideRefs</strong>
configuration along with <strong>transfer.hideRefs</strong> (see <strong>git-config*(1)). This
option affects the next pseudo-ref option *–all</strong> or <strong>–glob</strong> and is
cleared after processing them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–reflog</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all objects mentioned by reflogs are listed on the command
line as <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–alternate-refs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all objects mentioned as ref tips of alternate
repositories were listed on the command line. An alternate repository is
any repository whose object directory is specified in
<strong>objects/info/alternates</strong>. The set of included objects may be modified
by <strong>core.alternateRefsCommand</strong>, etc. See *git-config*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–single-worktree</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, all working trees will be examined by the following options
when there are more than one (see <strong>git-worktree*(1)): *–all</strong>,
<strong>–reflog</strong> and <strong>–indexed-objects</strong>. This option forces them to examine
the current working tree only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignore-missing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon seeing an invalid object name in the input, pretend as if the bad
input was not given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–bisect</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if the bad bisection ref <strong>refs/bisect/bad</strong> was listed and as
if it was followed by <strong>–not</strong> and the good bisection refs
<strong>refs/bisect/good-*</strong> on the command line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–stdin</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to getting arguments from the command line, read them from
standard input as well. This accepts commits and pseudo-options like
<strong>–all</strong> and <strong>–glob=</strong>. When a <strong>–</strong> separator is seen, the following
input is treated as paths and used to limit the result. Flags like
<strong>–not</strong> which are read via standard input are only respected for
arguments passed in the same way and will not influence any subsequent
command line arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–cherry-mark</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like <strong>–cherry-pick</strong> (see below) but mark equivalent commits with <strong>=</strong>
rather than omitting them, and inequivalent ones with <strong>+</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–cherry-pick</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Omit any commit that introduces the same change as another commit on the
“other side” when the set of commits are limited with symmetric
difference.</p>
<p>
For example, if you have two branches, <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, a usual way to list
all commits on only one side of them is with <strong>–left-right</strong> (see the
example below in the description of the <strong>–left-right</strong> option). However,
it shows the commits that were cherry-picked from the other branch (for
example, “3rd on b” may be cherry-picked from branch A). With this
option, such pairs of commits are excluded from the output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–left-only, –right-only</p>
<blockquote>
<p>List only commits on the respective side of a symmetric difference, i.e.
only those which would be marked <strong>&lt;</strong> resp. <strong>&gt;</strong> by <strong>–left-right</strong>.</p>
<p>
For example, <strong>–cherry-pick –right-only A…B</strong> omits those commits from
<strong>B</strong> which are in <strong>A</strong> or are patch-equivalent to a commit in <strong>A</strong>. In
other words, this lists the <strong>+</strong> commits from <strong>git cherry A B</strong>. More
precisely, <strong>–cherry-pick –right-only –no-merges</strong> gives the exact
list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–cherry</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A synonym for <strong>–right-only –cherry-mark –no-merges</strong>; useful to limit
the output to the commits on our side and mark those that have been
applied to the other side of a forked history with <strong>git log –cherry
upstream…mybranch</strong>, similar to <strong>git cherry upstream mybranch</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-g, –walk-reflogs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk reflog entries from
the most recent one to older ones. When this option is used you cannot
specify commits to exclude (that is, <em>^commit</em>, <em>commit1..commit2</em>, and
<em>commit1…commit2</em> notations cannot be used).</p>
<p>
With <strong>–pretty</strong> format other than <strong>oneline</strong> and <strong>reference</strong> (for obvious
reasons), this causes the output to have two extra lines of information
taken from the reflog. The reflog designator in the output may be shown
as <strong>ref@{&lt;Nth&gt;}</strong> (where <em>&lt;Nth&gt;</em> is the reverse-chronological index in
the reflog) or as <strong>ref@{&lt;timestamp&gt;}</strong> (with the <em>&lt;timestamp&gt;</em> for that
entry), depending on a few rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>If the starting point is specified as <strong>ref@{&lt;Nth&gt;}</strong>, show the index
format.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>If the starting point was specified as <strong>ref@{now}</strong>, show the timestamp
format.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>If neither was used, but <strong>–date</strong> was given on the command line, show
the timestamp in the format requested by <strong>–date</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, show the index format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Under <strong>–pretty=oneline</strong>, the commit message is prefixed with this
information on the same line. This option cannot be combined with
<strong>–reverse</strong>. See also *git-reflog*(1).</p>
<p>
Under <strong>–pretty=reference</strong>, this information will not be shown at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–merge</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show commits touching conflicted paths in the range <strong>HEAD…&lt;other&gt;</strong>,
where <strong>&lt;other&gt;</strong> is the first existing pseudoref in <strong>MERGE_HEAD</strong>,
<strong>CHERRY_PICK_HEAD</strong>, <strong>REVERT_HEAD</strong> or <strong>REBASE_HEAD</strong>. Only works when the
index has unmerged entries. This option can be used to show relevant
commits when resolving conflicts from a 3-way merge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–boundary</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output excluded boundary commits. Boundary commits are prefixed with
<strong>-</strong>.</p>

History Simplification
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history, for example
the commits modifying a particular &lt;path&gt;. But there are two parts of
<em>History Simplification</em>, one part is selecting the commits and the
other is how to do it, as there are various strategies to simplify the
history.</p>
<p>
The following options select the commits to be shown:</p>
<p>
&lt;paths&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commits modifying the given &lt;paths&gt; are selected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–simplify-by-decoration</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commits that are referred by some branch or tag are selected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that extra commits can be shown to give a meaningful history.</p>
<p>
The following options affect the way the simplification is performed:</p>
<p>
Default mode</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simplifies the history to the simplest history explaining the final
state of the tree. Simplest because it prunes some side branches if the
end result is the same (i.e. merging branches with the same content)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–show-pulls</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Include all commits from the default mode, but also any merge commits
that are not TREESAME to the first parent but are TREESAME to a later
parent. This mode is helpful for showing the merge commits that &#34;first
introduced&#34; a change to a branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–full-history</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Same as the default mode, but does not prune some history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–dense</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only the selected commits are shown, plus some to have a meaningful
history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–sparse</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All commits in the simplified history are shown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–simplify-merges</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additional option to <strong>–full-history</strong> to remove some needless merges
from the resulting history, as there are no selected commits
contributing to this merge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ancestry-path[=&lt;commit&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When given a range of commits to display (e.g. <em>commit1..commit2</em> or
<em>commit2 ^commit1</em>), only display commits in that range that are
ancestors of &lt;commit&gt;, descendants of &lt;commit&gt;, or &lt;commit&gt; itself. If
no commit is specified, use <em>commit1</em> (the excluded part of the range)
as &lt;commit&gt;. Can be passed multiple times; if so, a commit is included
if it is any of the commits given or if it is an ancestor or descendant
of one of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A more detailed explanation follows.</p>
<p>
Suppose you specified <strong>foo</strong> as the &lt;paths&gt;. We shall call commits that
modify <strong>foo</strong> !TREESAME, and the rest TREESAME. (In a diff filtered for
<strong>foo</strong>, they look different and equal, respectively.)</p>
<p>
In the following, we will always refer to the same example history to
illustrate the differences between simplification settings. We assume
that you are filtering for a file <strong>foo</strong> in this commit graph:</p>

The horizontal line of history A—Q is taken to be the first parent of
each merge. The commits are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>I</strong> is the initial commit, in which <strong>foo</strong> exists with contents “asdf”,
and a file <strong>quux</strong> exists with contents “quux”. Initial commits are
compared to an empty tree, so <strong>I</strong> is !TREESAME.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
In <strong>A</strong>, <strong>foo</strong> contains just “foo”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>B</strong> contains the same change as <strong>A</strong>. Its merge <strong>M</strong> is trivial and hence
TREESAME to all parents.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>C</strong> does not change <strong>foo</strong>, but its merge <strong>N</strong> changes it to “foobar”, so
it is not TREESAME to any parent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>D</strong> sets <strong>foo</strong> to “baz”. Its merge <strong>O</strong> combines the strings from <strong>N</strong> and
<strong>D</strong> to “foobarbaz”; i.e., it is not TREESAME to any parent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>E</strong> changes <strong>quux</strong> to “xyzzy”, and its merge <strong>P</strong> combines the strings to
“quux xyzzy”. <strong>P</strong> is TREESAME to <strong>O</strong>, but not to <strong>E</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>X</strong> is an independent root commit that added a new file <strong>side</strong>, and <strong>Y</strong>
modified it. <strong>Y</strong> is TREESAME to <strong>X</strong>. Its merge <strong>Q</strong> added <strong>side</strong> to <strong>P</strong>,
and <strong>Q</strong> is TREESAME to <strong>P</strong>, but not to <strong>Y</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>rev-list</strong> walks backwards through history, including or excluding
commits based on whether <strong>–full-history</strong> and/or parent rewriting (via
<strong>–parents</strong> or <strong>–children</strong>) are used. The following settings are
available.</p>
<p>
Default mode</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent (though this
can be changed, see <strong>–sparse</strong> below). If the commit was a merge, and it
was TREESAME to one parent, follow only that parent. (Even if there are
several TREESAME parents, follow only one of them.) Otherwise, follow
all parents.</p>
<p>
This results in:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---N---O
         /     /   /
        I---------D
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is
available, removed <strong>B</strong> from consideration entirely. <strong>C</strong> was considered
via <strong>N</strong>, but is TREESAME. Root commits are compared to an empty tree, so
<strong>I</strong> is !TREESAME.</p>
<p>
Parent/child relations are only visible with <strong>–parents</strong>, but that does
not affect the commits selected in default mode, so we have shown the
parent lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–full-history without parent rewriting</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This mode differs from the default in one point: always follow all
parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them. Even if more
than one side of the merge has commits that are included, this does not
imply that the merge itself is! In the example, we get</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        I  A  B  N  D  O  P  Q
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>M</strong> was excluded because it is TREESAME to both parents. <strong>E</strong>, <strong>C</strong> and
<strong>B</strong> were all walked, but only <strong>B</strong> was !TREESAME, so the others do not
appear.</p>
<p>
Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to talk
about the parent/child relationships between the commits, so we show
them disconnected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–full-history with parent rewriting</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ordinary commits are only included if they are !TREESAME (though this
can be changed, see <strong>–sparse</strong> below).</p>
<p>
Merges are always included. However, their parent list is rewritten:
Along each parent, prune away commits that are not included themselves.
This results in</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M---N---O---P---Q
         /     /   /   /   /
        I     B   /   D   /
         \   /   /   /   /
          `-------------
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Compare to <strong>–full-history</strong> without rewriting above. Note that <strong>E</strong> was
pruned away because it is TREESAME, but the parent list of P was
rewritten to contain <strong>E*s parent *I</strong>. The same happened for <strong>C</strong> and <strong>N</strong>,
and <strong>X</strong>, <strong>Y</strong> and <strong>Q</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In addition to the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME
affects inclusion:</p>
<p>
–dense</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commits that are walked are included if they are not TREESAME to any
parent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–sparse</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All commits that are walked are included.</p>
<p>
Note that without <strong>–full-history</strong>, this still simplifies merges: if one
of the parents is TREESAME, we follow only that one, so the other sides
of the merge are never walked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–simplify-merges</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, build a history graph in the same way that <strong>–full-history</strong> with
parent rewriting does (see above).</p>
<p>
Then simplify each commit <strong>C</strong> to its replacement <strong>C</strong> in the final
history according to the following rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Set <strong>C</strong> to <strong>C</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Replace each parent <strong>P</strong> of <strong>C</strong> with its simplification <strong>P</strong>. In the
process, drop parents that are ancestors of other parents or that are
root commits TREESAME to an empty tree, and remove duplicates, but take
care to never drop all parents that we are TREESAME to.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
If after this parent rewriting, <strong>C</strong> is a root or merge commit (has zero
or &gt;1 parents), a boundary commit, or !TREESAME, it remains. Otherwise,
it is replaced with its only parent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The effect of this is best shown by way of comparing to <strong>–full-history</strong>
with parent rewriting. The example turns into:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M---N---O
         /     /       /
        I     B       D
         \   /       /
          `---------
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note the major differences in <strong>N</strong>, <strong>P</strong>, and <strong>Q</strong> over <strong>–full-history</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>N*s parent list had *I</strong> removed, because it is an ancestor of the other
parent <strong>M</strong>. Still, <strong>N</strong> remained because it is !TREESAME.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>P*s parent list similarly had *I</strong> removed. <strong>P</strong> was then removed
completely, because it had one parent and is TREESAME.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>Q*s parent list had *Y</strong> simplified to <strong>X</strong>. <strong>X</strong> was then removed,
because it was a TREESAME root. <strong>Q</strong> was then removed completely, because
it had one parent and is TREESAME.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is another simplification mode available:</p>
<p>
–ancestry-path[=&lt;commit&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the displayed commits to those which are an ancestor of &lt;commit&gt;,
or which are a descendant of &lt;commit&gt;, or are &lt;commit&gt; itself.</p>
<p>
As an example use case, consider the following commit history:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
            D---E-------F
           /     \       \
          B---C---G---H---I---J
         /                     \
        A-------K---------------L--M
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
A regular <em>D..M</em> computes the set of commits that are ancestors of <strong>M</strong>,
but excludes the ones that are ancestors of <strong>D</strong>. This is useful to see
what happened to the history leading to <strong>M</strong> since <strong>D</strong>, in the sense that
“what does <strong>M</strong> have that did not exist in <strong>D*”. The result in this
example would be all the commits, except *A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> (and <strong>D</strong> itself, of
course).</p>
<p>
When we want to find out what commits in <strong>M</strong> are contaminated with the
bug introduced by <strong>D</strong> and need fixing, however, we might want to view
only the subset of <em>D..M</em> that are actually descendants of <strong>D</strong>, i.e.
excluding <strong>C</strong> and <strong>K</strong>. This is exactly what the <strong>–ancestry-path</strong> option
does. Applied to the <em>D..M</em> range, it results in:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
                E-------F
                 \       \
                  G---H---I---J
                               \
                                L--M
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
We can also use <strong>–ancestry-path=D</strong> instead of <strong>–ancestry-path</strong> which
means the same thing when applied to the <em>D..M</em> range but is just more
explicit.</p>
<p>
If we instead are interested in a given topic within this range, and all
commits affected by that topic, we may only want to view the subset of
<strong>D..M</strong> which contain that topic in their ancestry path. So, using
<strong>–ancestry-path=H D..M</strong> for example would result in:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
                E
                 \
                  G---H---I---J
                               \
                                L--M
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Whereas <strong>–ancestry-path=K D..M</strong> would result in</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
                K---------------L--M
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
Before discussing another option, <strong>–show-pulls</strong>, we need to create a
new example history.</p>
<p>
A common problem users face when looking at simplified history is that a
commit they know changed a file somehow does not appear in the file&#39;s
simplified history. Let&#39;s demonstrate a new example and show how options
such as <strong>–full-history</strong> and <strong>–simplify-merges</strong> works in that case:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M-----C--N---O---P
         /     / \  \  \/   /   /
        I     B   \  R-`-Z   /
         \   /     \/         /
          \ /      /\        /
           `---X--  `---Y--
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
For this example, suppose <strong>I</strong> created <strong>file.txt</strong> which was modified by
<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>X</strong> in different ways. The single-parent commits <strong>C</strong>, <strong>Z</strong>,
and <strong>Y</strong> do not change <strong>file.txt</strong>. The merge commit <strong>M</strong> was created by
resolving the merge conflict to include both changes from <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>
and hence is not TREESAME to either. The merge commit <strong>R</strong>, however, was
created by ignoring the contents of <strong>file.txt</strong> at <strong>M</strong> and taking only
the contents of <strong>file.txt</strong> at <strong>X</strong>. Hence, <strong>R</strong> is TREESAME to <strong>X</strong> but not
<strong>M</strong>. Finally, the natural merge resolution to create <strong>N</strong> is to take the
contents of <strong>file.txt</strong> at <strong>R</strong>, so <strong>N</strong> is TREESAME to <strong>R</strong> but not <strong>C</strong>.
The merge commits <strong>O</strong> and <strong>P</strong> are TREESAME to their first parents, but
not to their second parents, <strong>Z</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> respectively.</p>
<p>
When using the default mode, <strong>N</strong> and <strong>R</strong> both have a TREESAME parent, so
those edges are walked and the others are ignored. The resulting history
graph is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        I---X
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
When using <strong>–full-history</strong>, Git walks every edge. This will discover
the commits <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> and the merge <strong>M</strong>, but also will reveal the
merge commits <strong>O</strong> and <strong>P</strong>. With parent rewriting, the resulting graph
is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M--------N---O---P
         /     / \  \  \/   /   /
        I     B   \  R-`--   /
         \   /     \/         /
          \ /      /\        /
           `---X--  `------
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here, the merge commits <strong>O</strong> and <strong>P</strong> contribute extra noise, as they did
not actually contribute a change to <strong>file.txt</strong>. They only merged a topic
that was based on an older version of <strong>file.txt</strong>. This is a common issue
in repositories using a workflow where many contributors work in
parallel and merge their topic branches along a single trunk: many
unrelated merges appear in the <strong>–full-history</strong> results.</p>
<p>
When using the <strong>–simplify-merges</strong> option, the commits <strong>O</strong> and <strong>P</strong>
disappear from the results. This is because the rewritten second parents
of <strong>O</strong> and <strong>P</strong> are reachable from their first parents. Those edges are
removed and then the commits look like single-parent commits that are
TREESAME to their parent. This also happens to the commit <strong>N</strong>, resulting
in a history view as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M--.
         /     /    \
        I     B      R
         \   /      /
          \ /      /
           `---X--
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In this view, we see all of the important single-parent changes from
<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>X</strong>. We also see the carefully-resolved merge <strong>M</strong> and the
not-so-carefully-resolved merge <strong>R</strong>. This is usually enough information
to determine why the commits <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> &#34;disappeared&#34; from history in
the default view. However, there are a few issues with this approach.</p>
<p>
The first issue is performance. Unlike any previous option, the
<strong>–simplify-merges</strong> option requires walking the entire commit history
before returning a single result. This can make the option difficult to
use for very large repositories.</p>
<p>
The second issue is one of auditing. When many contributors are working
on the same repository, it is important which merge commits introduced a
change into an important branch. The problematic merge <strong>R</strong> above is not
likely to be the merge commit that was used to merge into an important
branch. Instead, the merge <strong>N</strong> was used to merge <strong>R</strong> and <strong>X</strong> into the
important branch. This commit may have information about why the change
<strong>X</strong> came to override the changes from <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> in its commit message.</p>
<p>
–show-pulls</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the commits shown in the default history, show each merge
commit that is not TREESAME to its first parent but is TREESAME to a
later parent.</p>
<p>
When a merge commit is included by <strong>–show-pulls</strong>, the merge is treated
as if it &#34;pulled&#34; the change from another branch. When using
<strong>–show-pulls</strong> on this example (and no other options) the resulting
graph is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        I---X---R---N
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here, the merge commits <strong>R</strong> and <strong>N</strong> are included because they pulled the
commits <strong>X</strong> and <strong>R</strong> into the base branch, respectively. These merges are
the reason the commits <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> do not appear in the default history.</p>
<p>
When <strong>–show-pulls</strong> is paired with <strong>–simplify-merges</strong>, the graph
includes all of the necessary information:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M--.   N
         /     /    \ /
        I     B      R
         \   /      /
          \ /      /
           `---X--
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Notice that since <strong>M</strong> is reachable from <strong>R</strong>, the edge from <strong>N</strong> to <strong>M</strong>
was simplified away. However, <strong>N</strong> still appears in the history as an
important commit because it &#34;pulled&#34; the change <strong>R</strong> into the main
branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <strong>–simplify-by-decoration</strong> option allows you to view only the big
picture of the topology of the history, by omitting commits that are not
referenced by tags. Commits are marked as !TREESAME (in other words,
kept after history simplification rules described above) if (1) they are
referenced by tags, or (2) they change the contents of the paths given
on the command line. All other commits are marked as TREESAME (subject
to be simplified away).</p>
