DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from
the Web. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as
retrieval through HTTP proxies.</p>
<p>
Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background,
while the user is not logged on. This allows you to start a retrieval
and disconnect from the system, letting Wget finish the work. By
contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user&#39;s presence,
which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data.</p>
<p>
Wget can follow links in HTML, XHTML, and CSS pages, to create local
versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory structure
of the original site. This is sometimes referred to as &#34;recursive
downloading.&#34; While doing that, Wget respects the Robot Exclusion
Standard (<em>/robots.txt</em>). Wget can be instructed to convert the links in
downloaded files to point at the local files, for offline viewing.</p>
<p>
Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network
connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will keep
retrying until the whole file has been retrieved. If the server supports
regetting, it will instruct the server to continue the download from
where it left off.</p>

Option Syntax
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Since Wget uses GNU getopt to process command-line arguments, every
option has a long form along with the short one. Long options are more
convenient to remember, but take time to type. You may freely mix
different option styles, or specify options after the command-line
arguments. Thus you may write:</p>
<p>
wget -r –tries=10 <a href="http://fly.srk.fer.hr/">http://fly.srk.fer.hr/</a> -o log</p>
<p>
The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument may
be omitted. Instead of <strong>-o log</strong> you can write <strong>-olog</strong>.</p>
<p>
You may put several options that do not require arguments together,
like:</p>
<p>
wget -drc &lt;URL&gt;</p>
<p>
This is completely equivalent to:</p>
<p>
wget -d -r -c &lt;URL&gt;</p>
<p>
Since the options can be specified after the arguments, you may
terminate them with <strong>–</strong>. So the following will try to download URL
<strong>-x</strong>, reporting failure to <em>log</em>:</p>
<p>
wget -o log – -x</p>
<p>
The options that accept comma-separated lists all respect the convention
that specifying an empty list clears its value. This can be useful to
clear the <em>.wgetrc</em> settings. For instance, if your <em>.wgetrc</em> sets
<code class="verbatim">exclude_directories</code> to <em>/cgi-bin</em>, the following example will first
reset it, and then set it to exclude <em>/~nobody</em> and <em>/~somebody</em>. You
can also clear the lists in <em>.wgetrc</em>.</p>
<p>
wget -X &#34;&#34; -X /~nobody,/~somebody</p>
<p>
Most options that do not accept arguments are <em>boolean</em> options, so
named because their state can be captured with a yes-or-no (&#34;boolean&#34;)
variable. For example, <strong>–follow-ftp</strong> tells Wget to follow FTP links
from HTML files and, on the other hand, <strong>–no-glob</strong> tells it not to
perform file globbing on FTP URLs. A boolean option is either
<em>affirmative</em> or <em>negative</em> (beginning with <strong>–no</strong>). All such options
share several properties.</p>
<p>
Unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that the default behavior is the
opposite of what the option accomplishes. For example, the documented
existence of <strong>–follow-ftp</strong> assumes that the default is to <em>not</em> follow
FTP links from HTML pages.</p>
<p>
Affirmative options can be negated by prepending the <strong>–no-</strong> to the
option name; negative options can be negated by omitting the <strong>–no-</strong>
prefix. This might seem superfluous—if the default for an affirmative
option is to not do something, then why provide a way to explicitly turn
it off? But the startup file may in fact change the default. For
instance, using <code class="verbatim">follow_ftp = on</code> in <em>.wgetrc</em> makes Wget <em>follow</em> FTP
links by default, and using <strong>–no-follow-ftp</strong> is the only way to restore
the factory default from the command line.</p>

administrator may have chosen to compile Wget without debug support, in
which case <strong>-d</strong> will not work. Please note that compiling with debug

</dl>
<p>Read URLs from a local or external <em>file</em>. If <strong>-</strong> is specified as
<em>file</em>, URLs are read from the standard input. (Use <strong>./-</strong> to read from a
file literally named <strong>-</strong>.) If this function is used, no URLs need be
present on the command line. If there are URLs both on the command line
and in an input file, those on the command lines will be the first ones
to be retrieved. If <strong>–force-html</strong> is not specified, then <em>file</em> should
consist of a series of URLs, one per line. However, if you specify
<strong>–force-html</strong>, the document will be regarded as <strong>html</strong>. In that case
you may have problems with relative links, which you can solve either by
adding <code class="verbatim">&lt;base</code> href=&#34;<em><code class="verbatim">url=/</code>&#34;&gt;= to the documents or by specifying
*–base=*/url</em> on the command line. If the <em>file</em> is an external one,
the document will be automatically treated as <strong>html</strong> if the Content-Type
matches <strong>text/html</strong>. Furthermore, the <em>file</em>&#39;s location will be
implicitly used as base href if none was specified.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–input-metalink=file
</dt>
<dd>Downloads files covered in local Metalink
<em>file</em>. Metalink version 3 and 4 are supported.</dd>
<dt>
–keep-badhash
</dt>
<dd>Keeps downloaded Metalink&#39;s files with a bad hash.
It appends .badhash to the name of Metalink&#39;s files which have a
checksum mismatch, except without overwriting existing files.</dd>
<dt>
–metalink-over-http
</dt>
<dd>Issues HTTP HEAD request instead of GET and
extracts Metalink metadata from response headers. Then it switches to
Metalink download. If no valid Metalink metadata is found, it falls
back to ordinary HTTP download. Enables <strong>Content-Type:
application/metalink4+xml</strong> files download/processing.</dd>
<dt>
–metalink-index=number
</dt>
<dd>Set the Metalink
<strong>application/metalink4+xml</strong> metaurl ordinal NUMBER. From 1 to the
total number of &#34;application/metalink4+xml&#34; available. Specify 0 or
<strong>inf</strong> to choose the first good one. Metaurls, such as those from a
<strong>–metalink-over-http</strong>, may have been sorted by priority key&#39;s value;
keep this in mind to choose the right NUMBER.</dd>
<dt>
–preferred-location
</dt>
<dd>Set preferred location for Metalink resources.
This has effect if multiple resources with same priority are
available.</dd>
<dt>
–xattr

<dd></dd>
<dt>
–force-html
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>When input is read from a file, force it to be treated as an HTML file.
This enables you to retrieve relative links from existing HTML files on
your local disk, by adding <code class="verbatim">&lt;base</code> href=&#34;/=url=/=&#34;&gt;= to HTML, or using
the <strong>–base</strong> command-line option.</p>
<dl>

<dd></dd>
<dt>
–base=URL
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Resolves relative links using <em>URL</em> as the point of reference, when
reading links from an HTML file specified via the <strong>-i*/</strong>–input-file*
option (together with <strong>–force-html</strong>, or when the input file was fetched
remotely from a server describing it as HTML). This is equivalent to the
presence of a <code class="verbatim">BASE</code> tag in the HTML input file, with <em>URL</em> as the value
for the <code class="verbatim">href</code> attribute. For instance, if you specify
<strong><a href="http://foo/bar/a.html">http://foo/bar/a.html</a></strong> for <em>URL</em>, and Wget reads <strong>../baz/b.html</strong> from
the input file, it would be resolved to <strong><a href="http://foo/baz/b.html">http://foo/baz/b.html</a></strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–config=FILE
</dt>
<dd>Specify the location of a startup file you wish to
use instead of the default one(s). Use –no-config to disable reading
of config files. If both –config and –no-config are given,
–no-config is ignored.</dd>
<dt>
–rejected-log=logfile

<p>The documents will not be written to the appropriate files, but all will
be concatenated together and written to <em>file</em>. If <strong>-</strong> is used as
<em>file</em>, documents will be printed to standard output, disabling link
conversion. (Use <strong>./-</strong> to print to a file literally named <strong>-</strong>.) Use of
<strong>-O</strong> is <em>not</em> intended to mean simply &#34;use the name <em>file</em> instead of
the one in the URL;&#34; rather, it is analogous to shell redirection: <strong>wget
-O file <a href="http://foo">http://foo</a></strong> is intended to work like <strong>wget -O - <a href="http://foo">http://foo</a> &gt;
file</strong>; <em>file</em> will be truncated immediately, and <em>all</em> downloaded
content will be written there. For this reason, <strong>-N</strong> (for
timestamp-checking) is not supported in combination with <strong>-O</strong>: since
<em>file</em> is always newly created, it will always have a very new
timestamp. A warning will be issued if this combination is used.
Similarly, using <strong>-r</strong> or <strong>-p</strong> with <strong>-O</strong> may not work as you expect: Wget
won&#39;t just download the first file to <em>file</em> and then download the rest
to their normal names: <em>all</em> downloaded content will be placed in
<em>file</em>. This was disabled in version 1.11, but has been reinstated (with
a warning) in 1.11.2, as there are some cases where this behavior can
actually have some use. A combination with <strong>-nc</strong> is only accepted if the
given output file does not exist. Note that a combination with <strong>-k</strong> is
only permitted when downloading a single document, as in that case it
will just convert all relative URIs to external ones; <strong>-k</strong> makes no
sense for multiple URIs when they&#39;re all being downloaded to a single
file; <strong>-k</strong> can be used only when the output is a regular file.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-nc

<dd></dd>
<dt>
–no-clobber
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory, Wget&#39;s
behavior depends on a few options, including <strong>-nc</strong>. In certain cases,
the local file will be <em>clobbered</em>, or overwritten, upon repeated
download. In other cases it will be preserved. When running Wget without
<strong>-N</strong>, <strong>-nc</strong>, <strong>-r</strong>, or <strong>-p</strong>, downloading the same file in the same
directory will result in the original copy of <em>file</em> being preserved and
the second copy being named /file/*.1*. If that file is downloaded yet
again, the third copy will be named /file/*.2*, and so on. (This is also
the behavior with <strong>-nd</strong>, even if <strong>-r</strong> or <strong>-p</strong> are in effect.) When <strong>-nc</strong>
is specified, this behavior is suppressed, and Wget will refuse to
download newer copies of <em>file</em>. Therefore, &#34;<code class="verbatim">no-clobber</code>&#34; is actually a
misnomer in this mode—it&#39;s not clobbering that&#39;s prevented (as the
numeric suffixes were already preventing clobbering), but rather the
multiple version saving that&#39;s prevented. When running Wget with <strong>-r</strong> or
<strong>-p</strong>, but without <strong>-N</strong>, <strong>-nd</strong>, or <strong>-nc</strong>, re-downloading a file will
result in the new copy simply overwriting the old. Adding <strong>-nc</strong> will
prevent this behavior, instead causing the original version to be
preserved and any newer copies on the server to be ignored. When running
Wget with <strong>-N</strong>, with or without <strong>-r</strong> or <strong>-p</strong>, the decision as to whether
or not to download a newer copy of a file depends on the local and
remote timestamp and size of the file. <strong>-nc</strong> may not be specified at the
same time as <strong>-N</strong>. A combination with <strong>-O*/</strong>–output-document* is only
accepted if the given output file does not exist. Note that when <strong>-nc</strong>
is specified, files with the suffixes <strong>.html</strong> or <strong>.htm</strong> will be loaded
from the local disk and parsed as if they had been retrieved from the
Web.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–backups=backups
</dt>
<dd>Before (over)writing a file, back up an existing
file by adding a <strong>.1</strong> suffix (<strong>_1</strong> on VMS) to the file name. Such
backup files are rotated to <strong>.2</strong>, <strong>.3</strong>, and so on, up to <em>backups</em>
(and lost beyond that).</dd>
<dt>
–no-netrc
</dt>
<dd>Do not try to obtain credentials from <em>.netrc</em> file. By
default <em>.netrc</em> file is searched for credentials in case none have
been passed on command line and authentication is required.</dd>
<dt>
-c
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
–continue
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Continue getting a partially-downloaded file. This is useful when you
want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of Wget, or
by another program. For instance: wget -c
<a href="ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z">ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z</a> If there is a file named <em>ls-lR.Z</em> in
the current directory, Wget will assume that it is the first portion of
the remote file, and will ask the server to continue the retrieval from
an offset equal to the length of the local file. Note that you don&#39;t
need to specify this option if you just want the current invocation of
Wget to retry downloading a file should the connection be lost midway
through. This is the default behavior. <strong>-c</strong> only affects resumption of
downloads started <em>prior</em> to this invocation of Wget, and whose local
files are still sitting around. Without <strong>-c</strong>, the previous example would
just download the remote file to <em>ls-lR.Z.1</em>, leaving the truncated
<em>ls-lR.Z</em> file alone. If you use <strong>-c</strong> on a non-empty file, and the
server does not support continued downloading, Wget will restart the
download from scratch and overwrite the existing file entirely.
Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use <strong>-c</strong> on a file which is of equal
size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to download the file and
print an explanatory message. The same happens when the file is smaller
on the server than locally (presumably because it was changed on the
server since your last download attempt)—because &#34;continuing&#34; is not
meaningful, no download occurs. On the other side of the coin, while
using <strong>-c</strong>, any file that&#39;s bigger on the server than locally will be
considered an incomplete download and only
<code class="verbatim">(length(remote) - length(local))</code> bytes will be downloaded and tacked
onto the end of the local file. This behavior can be desirable in
certain cases—for instance, you can use <strong>wget -c</strong> to download just the
new portion that&#39;s been appended to a data collection or log file.
However, if the file is bigger on the server because it&#39;s been
<em>changed</em>, as opposed to just <em>appended</em> to, you&#39;ll end up with a
garbled file. Wget has no way of verifying that the local file is really
a valid prefix of the remote file. You need to be especially careful of
this when using <strong>-c</strong> in conjunction with <strong>-r</strong>, since every file will be
considered as an &#34;incomplete download&#34; candidate. Another instance where
you&#39;ll get a garbled file if you try to use <strong>-c</strong> is if you have a lame
HTTP proxy that inserts a &#34;transfer interrupted&#34; string into the local
file. In the future a &#34;rollback&#34; option may be added to deal with this
case. Note that <strong>-c</strong> only works with FTP servers and with HTTP servers
that support the <code class="verbatim">Range</code> header.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–start-pos=OFFSET
</dt>
<dd>Start downloading at zero-based position
<em>OFFSET</em>. Offset may be expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the `k&#39;
suffix, or megabytes with the `m&#39; suffix, etc. <strong>–start-pos</strong> has
higher precedence over <strong>–continue</strong>. When <strong>–start-pos</strong> and
<strong>–continue</strong> are both specified, wget will emit a warning then proceed
as if <strong>–continue</strong> was absent. Server support for continued download
is required, otherwise <strong>–start-pos</strong> cannot help. See <strong>-c</strong> for
details.</dd>
<dt>
–progress=type
</dt>
<dd>Select the type of the progress indicator you wish
to use. Legal indicators are &#34;dot&#34; and &#34;bar&#34;. The &#34;bar&#34; indicator is
used by default. It draws an ASCII progress bar graphics (a.k.a
&#34;thermometer&#34; display) indicating the status of retrieval. If the
output is not a TTY, the &#34;dot&#34; bar will be used by default. Use
<strong>–progress=dot</strong> to switch to the &#34;dot&#34; display. It traces the
retrieval by printing dots on the screen, each dot representing a
fixed amount of downloaded data. The progress <em>type</em> can also take one
or more parameters. The parameters vary based on the <em>type</em> selected.
Parameters to <em>type</em> are passed by appending them to the type sperated
by a colon (:) like this:
<strong>–progress=*/type/</strong>:*/parameter1/*:*/parameter2/. When using the
dotted retrieval, you may set the <em>style</em> by specifying the type as
*dot:*/style/. Different styles assign different meaning to one dot.
With the <code class="verbatim">default</code> style each dot represents 1K, there are ten dots in
a cluster and 50 dots in a line. The <code class="verbatim">binary</code> style has a more
&#34;computer&#34;-like orientation—8K dots, 16-dots clusters and 48 dots
per line (which makes for 384K lines). The <code class="verbatim">mega</code> style is suitable
for downloading large files—each dot represents 64K retrieved, there
are eight dots in a cluster, and 48 dots on each line (so each line
contains 3M). If <code class="verbatim">mega</code> is not enough then you can use the <code class="verbatim">giga</code>
style—each dot represents 1M retrieved, there are eight dots in a
cluster, and 32 dots on each line (so each line contains 32M). With
<strong>–progress=bar</strong>, there are currently two possible parameters, <em>force</em>
and <em>noscroll</em>. When the output is not a TTY, the progress bar always
falls back to &#34;dot&#34;, even if <strong>–progress=bar</strong> was passed to Wget
during invocation. This behaviour can be overridden and the &#34;bar&#34;
output forced by using the &#34;force&#34; parameter as
<strong>–progress=bar:force</strong>. By default, the <strong>bar</strong> style progress bar
scroll the name of the file from left to right for the file being
downloaded if the filename exceeds the maximum length allotted for its
display. In certain cases, such as with <strong>–progress=bar:force</strong>, one
may not want the scrolling filename in the progress bar. By passing
the &#34;noscroll&#34; parameter, Wget can be forced to display as much of the
filename as possible without scrolling through it. Note that you can
set the default style using the <code class="verbatim">progress</code> command in <em>.wgetrc</em>. That
setting may be overridden from the command line. For example, to force
the bar output without scrolling, use <strong>–progress=bar:force:noscroll</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
–show-progress
</dt>
<dd>Force wget to display the progress bar in any
verbosity. By default, wget only displays the progress bar in verbose
mode. One may however, want wget to display the progress bar on screen
in conjunction with any other verbosity modes like <strong>–no-verbose</strong> or
<strong>–quiet</strong>. This is often a desired a property when invoking wget to
download several small/large files. In such a case, wget could simply
be invoked with this parameter to get a much cleaner output on the
screen. This option will also force the progress bar to be printed to
<em>stderr</em> when used alongside the <strong>–output-file</strong> option.</dd>

the use of <strong>–timestamping</strong> on subsequent invocations of wget.
However, it is sometimes useful to base the local file&#39;s timestamp on
when it was actually downloaded; for that purpose, the

needs much more work for Wget to get close to the functionality of
real web spiders.</dd>

</dl>
<p>Set the network timeout to <em>seconds</em> seconds. This is equivalent to
specifying <strong>–dns-timeout</strong>, <strong>–connect-timeout</strong>, and <strong>–read-timeout</strong>,
all at the same time. When interacting with the network, Wget can check
for timeout and abort the operation if it takes too long. This prevents
anomalies like hanging reads and infinite connects. The only timeout
enabled by default is a 900-second read timeout. Setting a timeout to 0
disables it altogether. Unless you know what you are doing, it is best
not to change the default timeout settings. All timeout-related options
accept decimal values, as well as subsecond values. For example, <strong>0.1</strong>
seconds is a legal (though unwise) choice of timeout. Subsecond timeouts
are useful for checking server response times or for testing network
latency.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–dns-timeout=seconds
</dt>
<dd>Set the DNS lookup timeout to <em>seconds</em>

will fail. By default, there is no timeout on DNS lookups, other than
that implemented by system libraries.</dd>
<dt>
–connect-timeout=seconds
</dt>
<dd>Set the connect timeout to <em>seconds</em>
seconds. TCP connections that take longer to establish will be
aborted. By default, there is no connect timeout, other than that
implemented by system libraries.</dd>
<dt>
–read-timeout=seconds
</dt>
<dd>Set the read (and write) timeout to
<em>seconds</em> seconds. The &#34;time&#34; of this timeout refers to <em>idle time</em>:
if, at any point in the download, no data is received for more than
the specified number of seconds, reading fails and the download is
restarted. This option does not directly affect the duration of the
entire download. Of course, the remote server may choose to terminate
the connection sooner than this option requires. The default read
timeout is 900 seconds.</dd>
<dt>
–limit-rate=amount
</dt>
<dd>Limit the download speed to <em>amount</em> bytes per
second. Amount may be expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the <strong>k</strong>
suffix, or megabytes with the <strong>m</strong> suffix. For example,
<strong>–limit-rate=20k</strong> will limit the retrieval rate to 20KB/s. This is
useful when, for whatever reason, you don&#39;t want Wget to consume the
entire available bandwidth. This option allows the use of decimal
numbers, usually in conjunction with power suffixes; for example,
<strong>–limit-rate=2.5k</strong> is a legal value. Note that Wget implements the
limiting by sleeping the appropriate amount of time after a network
read that took less time than specified by the rate. Eventually this
strategy causes the TCP transfer to slow down to approximately the
specified rate. However, it may take some time for this balance to be
achieved, so don&#39;t be surprised if limiting the rate doesn&#39;t work well
with very small files.</dd>
<dt>
-w seconds
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
–wait=seconds
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals. Use of this
option is recommended, as it lightens the server load by making the
requests less frequent. Instead of in seconds, the time can be specified
in minutes using the <code class="verbatim">m</code> suffix, in hours using <code class="verbatim">h</code> suffix, or in days
using <code class="verbatim">d</code> suffix. Specifying a large value for this option is useful if
the network or the destination host is down, so that Wget can wait long
enough to reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before the
retry. The waiting interval specified by this function is influenced by
<code class="verbatim">--random-wait</code>, which see.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–waitretry=seconds
</dt>
<dd>If you don&#39;t want Wget to wait between <em>every</em>
retrieval, but only between retries of failed downloads, you can use
this option. Wget will use <em>linear backoff</em>, waiting 1 second after
the first failure on a given file, then waiting 2 seconds after the
second failure on that file, up to the maximum number of <em>seconds</em> you
specify. By default, Wget will assume a value of 10 seconds.</dd>
<dt>
–random-wait
</dt>
<dd>Some web sites may perform log analysis to identify
retrieval programs such as Wget by looking for statistically
significant similarities in the time between requests. This option
causes the time between requests to vary between 0.5 and 1.5 * <em>wait</em>
seconds, where <em>wait</em> was specified using the <strong>–wait</strong> option, in
order to mask Wget&#39;s presence from such analysis. A 2001 article in a
publication devoted to development on a popular consumer platform
provided code to perform this analysis on the fly. Its author
suggested blocking at the class C address level to ensure automated
retrieval programs were blocked despite changing DHCP-supplied
addresses. The <strong>–random-wait</strong> option was inspired by this ill-advised
recommendation to block many unrelated users from a web site due to
the actions of one.</dd>
<dt>
–no-proxy
</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t use proxies, even if the appropriate <code class="verbatim">*_proxy</code>
environment variable is defined.</dd>
<dt>
-Q quota
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
–quota=quota
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Specify download quota for automatic retrievals. The value can be
specified in bytes (default), kilobytes (with <strong>k</strong> suffix), or megabytes
(with <strong>m</strong> suffix). Note that quota will never affect downloading a
single file. So if you specify <strong>wget -Q10k
<a href="https://example.com/ls-lR.gz">https://example.com/ls-lR.gz</a></strong>, all of the <em>ls-lR.gz</em> will be downloaded.
The same goes even when several URLs are specified on the command-line.
The quota is checked only at the end of each downloaded file, so it will
never result in a partially downloaded file. Thus you may safely type
<strong>wget -Q2m -i sites</strong>—download will be aborted after the file that
exhausts the quota is completely downloaded. Setting quota to 0 or to
<strong>inf</strong> unlimits the download quota.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–no-dns-cache
</dt>
<dd>Turn off caching of DNS lookups. Normally, Wget
remembers the IP addresses it looked up from DNS so it doesn&#39;t have to
repeatedly contact the DNS server for the same (typically small) set
of hosts it retrieves from. This cache exists in memory only; a new
Wget run will contact DNS again. However, it has been reported that in
some situations it is not desirable to cache host names, even for the
duration of a short-running application like Wget. With this option
Wget issues a new DNS lookup (more precisely, a new call to
<code class="verbatim">gethostbyname</code> or <code class="verbatim">getaddrinfo</code>) each time it makes a new connection.
Please note that this option will <em>not</em> affect caching that might be
performed by the resolving library or by an external caching layer,
such as NSCD. If you don&#39;t understand exactly what this option does,
you probably won&#39;t need it.</dd>
<dt>
–restrict-file-names=modes
</dt>
<dd>Change which characters found in remote
URLs must be escaped during generation of local filenames. Characters
that are <em>restricted</em> by this option are escaped, i.e. replaced with
<strong><code class="verbatim">%HH</code></strong>, where <strong>HH</strong> is the hexadecimal number that corresponds to the
restricted character. This option may also be used to force all
alphabetical cases to be either lower- or uppercase. By default, Wget
escapes the characters that are not valid or safe as part of file
names on your operating system, as well as control characters that are
typically unprintable. This option is useful for changing these
defaults, perhaps because you are downloading to a non-native
partition, or because you want to disable escaping of the control
characters, or you want to further restrict characters to only those
in the ASCII range of values. The <em>modes</em> are a comma-separated set of
text values. The acceptable values are <strong>unix</strong>, <strong>windows</strong>, <strong>nocontrol</strong>,
<strong>ascii</strong>, <strong>lowercase</strong>, and <strong>uppercase</strong>. The values <strong>unix</strong> and <strong>windows</strong>
are mutually exclusive (one will override the other), as are
<strong>lowercase</strong> and <strong>uppercase</strong>. Those last are special cases, as they do
not change the set of characters that would be escaped, but rather
force local file paths to be converted either to lower- or uppercase.
When &#34;unix&#34; is specified, Wget escapes the character <strong>/</strong> and the
control characters in the ranges 0–31 and 128–159. This is the
default on Unix-like operating systems. When &#34;windows&#34; is given, Wget
escapes the characters <strong>\</strong>, <strong>|</strong>, <strong>/</strong>, <strong>:</strong>, <strong>?</strong>, <strong>&#34;</strong>, <strong>*</strong>, <strong>&lt;</strong>, <strong>&gt;</strong>,
and the control characters in the ranges 0–31 and 128–159. In
addition to this, Wget in Windows mode uses <strong>+</strong> instead of <strong>:</strong> to
separate host and port in local file names, and uses <strong>@</strong> instead of
<strong>?</strong> to separate the query portion of the file name from the rest.
Therefore, a URL that would be saved as
<strong>www.xemacs.org:4300/search.pl?input=blah</strong> in Unix mode would be saved
as <strong>www.xemacs.org+4300/search.pl@input=blah</strong> in Windows mode. This
mode is the default on Windows. If you specify <strong>nocontrol</strong>, then the
escaping of the control characters is also switched off. This option
may make sense when you are downloading URLs whose names contain UTF-8
characters, on a system which can save and display filenames in UTF-8
(some possible byte values used in UTF-8 byte sequences fall in the
range of values designated by Wget as &#34;controls&#34;). The <strong>ascii</strong> mode is
used to specify that any bytes whose values are outside the range of
ASCII characters (that is, greater than 127) shall be escaped. This
can be useful when saving filenames whose encoding does not match the
one used locally.</dd>

<p>Force connecting to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. With <strong>–inet4-only</strong> or <strong>-4</strong>,
Wget will only connect to IPv4 hosts, ignoring AAAA records in DNS, and
refusing to connect to IPv6 addresses specified in URLs. Conversely,
with <strong>–inet6-only</strong> or <strong>-6</strong>, Wget will only connect to IPv6 hosts and
ignore A records and IPv4 addresses. Neither options should be needed
normally. By default, an IPv6-aware Wget will use the address family
specified by the host&#39;s DNS record. If the DNS responds with both IPv4
and IPv6 addresses, Wget will try them in sequence until it finds one it
can connect to. (Also see <code class="verbatim">--prefer-family</code> option described below.)
These options can be used to deliberately force the use of IPv4 or IPv6
address families on dual family systems, usually to aid debugging or to
deal with broken network configuration. Only one of <strong>–inet6-only</strong> and
<strong>–inet4-only</strong> may be specified at the same time. Neither option is
available in Wget compiled without IPv6 support.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–prefer-family=none/IPv4/IPv6
</dt>
<dd>When given a choice of several
addresses, connect to the addresses with specified address family
first. The address order returned by DNS is used without change by
default. This avoids spurious errors and connect attempts when
accessing hosts that resolve to both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses from IPv4
networks. For example, <strong>www.kame.net</strong> resolves to
<strong>2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:3085</strong> and to <strong>203.178.141.194</strong>. When
the preferred family is <code class="verbatim">IPv4</code>, the IPv4 address is used first; when
the preferred family is <code class="verbatim">IPv6</code>, the IPv6 address is used first; if the
specified value is <code class="verbatim">none</code>, the address order returned by DNS is used
without change. Unlike <strong>-4</strong> and <strong>-6</strong>, this option doesn&#39;t inhibit
access to any address family, it only changes the <em>order</em> in which the
addresses are accessed. Also note that the reordering performed by
this option is <em>stable</em>—it doesn&#39;t affect order of addresses of the
same family. That is, the relative order of all IPv4 addresses and of
all IPv6 addresses remains intact in all cases.</dd>
<dt>
–retry-connrefused

<dd>Consider &#34;connection refused&#34; a transient error
and try again. Normally Wget gives up on a URL when it is unable to

That setting may be overridden from the command line.</dd>
<dt>
–local-encoding=encoding

<dd>Force Wget to use <em>encoding</em> as the

as arguments from locale to UTF-8 for IRI support. Wget use the
function <code class="verbatim">nl_langinfo()</code> and then the <code class="verbatim">CHARSET</code> environment variable
to get the locale. If it fails, ASCII is used. You can set the default
local encoding using the <code class="verbatim">local_encoding</code> command in <em>.wgetrc</em>. That
setting may be overridden from the command line.</dd>
<dt>
–remote-encoding=encoding
</dt>
<dd>Force Wget to use <em>encoding</em> as the
default remote server encoding. That affects how Wget converts URIs
found in files from remote encoding to UTF-8 during a recursive fetch.
This options is only useful for IRI support, for the interpretation of
non-ASCII characters. For HTTP, remote encoding can be found in HTTP
<code class="verbatim">Content-Type</code> header and in HTML <code class="verbatim">Content-Type http-equiv</code> meta tag.
You can set the default encoding using the <code class="verbatim">remoteencoding</code> command in
<em>.wgetrc</em>. That setting may be overridden from the command line.</dd>

recursive retrieval will be saved. Take, for example, the directory at
<strong><a href="ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/">ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/</a></strong>. If you retrieve it with <strong>-r</strong>, it
will be saved locally under <em>ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/</em>. While the
<strong>-nH</strong> option can remove the <em>ftp.xemacs.org/</em> part, you are still
stuck with <em>pub/xemacs</em>. This is where <strong>–cut-dirs</strong> comes in handy; it
makes Wget not &#34;see&#34; <em>number</em> remote directory components. Here are
several examples of how <strong>–cut-dirs</strong> option works. No options -&gt;
ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/ -nH -&gt; pub/xemacs/ -nH –cut-dirs=1 -&gt;
xemacs/ -nH –cut-dirs=2 -&gt; . –cut-dirs=1 -&gt; ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/
… If you just want to get rid of the directory structure, this
option is similar to a combination of <strong>-nd</strong> and <strong>-P</strong>. However, unlike
<strong>-nd</strong>, <strong>–cut-dirs</strong> does not lose with subdirectories—for instance,

<p>If a file of type <strong>application/xhtml+xml</strong> or <strong>text/html</strong> is downloaded
and the URL does not end with the regexp <strong>\.[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]?</strong>, this
option will cause the suffix <strong>.html</strong> to be appended to the local
filename. This is useful, for instance, when you&#39;re mirroring a remote
site that uses <strong>.asp</strong> pages, but you want the mirrored pages to be
viewable on your stock Apache server. Another good use for this is when
you&#39;re downloading CGI-generated materials. A URL like
<strong><a href="http://site.com/article.cgi?25">http://site.com/article.cgi?25</a></strong> will be saved as <em>article.cgi?25.html</em>.
Note that filenames changed in this way will be re-downloaded every time
you re-mirror a site, because Wget can&#39;t tell that the local <em>X.html</em>
file corresponds to remote URL <em>X</em> (since it doesn&#39;t yet know that the
URL produces output of type <strong>text/html</strong> or <strong>application/xhtml+xml</strong>. As
of version 1.12, Wget will also ensure that any downloaded files of type
<strong>text/css</strong> end in the suffix <strong>.css</strong>, and the option was renamed from
<strong>–html-extension</strong>, to better reflect its new behavior. The old option
name is still acceptable, but should now be considered deprecated. As of
version 1.19.2, Wget will also ensure that any downloaded files with a
<code class="verbatim">Content-Encoding</code> of <strong>br</strong>, <strong>compress</strong>, <strong>deflate</strong> or <strong>gzip</strong> end in the
suffix <strong>.br</strong>, <strong>.Z</strong>, <strong>.zlib</strong> and <strong>.gz</strong> respectively. At some point in the

According to the type of the challenge, Wget will encode them using
either the <code class="verbatim">basic</code> (insecure), the <code class="verbatim">digest</code>, or the Windows <code class="verbatim">NTLM</code>
authentication scheme. Another way to specify username and password is
in the URL itself. Either method reveals your password to anyone who
bothers to run <code class="verbatim">ps</code>. To prevent the passwords from being seen, use the
<strong>–use-askpass</strong> or store them in <em>.wgetrc</em> or <em>.netrc</em>, and make sure to
protect those files from other users with <code class="verbatim">chmod</code>. If the passwords are
really important, do not leave them lying in those files either—edit

<dl>
<dt>
–no-http-keep-alive
</dt>
<dd>Turn off the &#34;keep-alive&#34; feature for HTTP
downloads. Normally, Wget asks the server to keep the connection open
so that, when you download more than one document from the same
server, they get transferred over the same TCP connection. This saves
time and at the same time reduces the load on the server. This option
is useful when, for some reason, persistent (keep-alive) connections
don&#39;t work for you, for example due to a server bug or due to the
inability of server-side scripts to cope with the connections.</dd>
<dt>
–no-cache

<dd>Disable server-side cache. In this case, Wget will send
the remote server appropriate directives (<strong>Cache-Control: no-cache</strong>
and <strong>Pragma: no-cache</strong>) to get the file from the remote service,
rather than returning the cached version. This is especially useful
for retrieving and flushing out-of-date documents on proxy servers.
Caching is allowed by default.</dd>
<dt>
–no-cookies
</dt>
<dd>Disable the use of cookies. Cookies are a mechanism
for maintaining server-side state. The server sends the client a
cookie using the <code class="verbatim">Set-Cookie</code> header, and the client responds with the
same cookie upon further requests. Since cookies allow the server
owners to keep track of visitors and for sites to exchange this
information, some consider them a breach of privacy. The default is to
use cookies; however, <em>storing</em> cookies is not on by default.</dd>
<dt>
–load-cookies file
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Load cookies from <em>file</em> before the first HTTP
retrieval. <em>file</em> is a textual file in the format originally used by
Netscape&#39;s <em>cookies.txt</em> file. You will typically use this option when
mirroring sites that require that you be logged in to access some or
all of their content. The login process typically works by the web
server issuing an HTTP cookie upon receiving and verifying your
credentials. The cookie is then resent by the browser when accessing
that part of the site, and so proves your identity. Mirroring such a
site requires Wget to send the same cookies your browser sends when
communicating with the site. This is achieved by
<strong>–load-cookies</strong>—simply point Wget to the location of the
<em>cookies.txt</em> file, and it will send the same cookies your browser
would send in the same situation. Different browsers keep textual
cookie files in different locations:</p>

</dt>
<dd>If you are using a different browser to create
your cookies, <strong>–load-cookies</strong> will only work if you can locate or
produce a cookie file in the Netscape format that Wget expects.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you cannot use <strong>–load-cookies</strong>, there might still be an
alternative. If your browser supports a &#34;cookie manager&#34;, you can use
it to view the cookies used when accessing the site you&#39;re mirroring.
Write down the name and value of the cookie, and manually instruct
Wget to send those cookies, bypassing the &#34;official&#34; cookie support:
wget –no-cookies –header &#34;Cookie: &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;&#34;</p>
</dd>
<dt>
–save-cookies file
</dt>
<dd>Save cookies to <em>file</em> before exiting. This
will not save cookies that have expired or that have no expiry time
(so-called &#34;session cookies&#34;), but also see <strong>–keep-session-cookies</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
–keep-session-cookies
</dt>
<dd>When specified, causes <strong>–save-cookies</strong> to
also save session cookies. Session cookies are normally not saved
because they are meant to be kept in memory and forgotten when you
exit the browser. Saving them is useful on sites that require you to
log in or to visit the home page before you can access some pages.
With this option, multiple Wget runs are considered a single browser
session as far as the site is concerned. Since the cookie file format
does not normally carry session cookies, Wget marks them with an
expiry timestamp of 0. Wget&#39;s <strong>–load-cookies</strong> recognizes those as
session cookies, but it might confuse other browsers. Also note that
cookies so loaded will be treated as other session cookies, which
means that if you want <strong>–save-cookies</strong> to preserve them again, you
must use <strong>–keep-session-cookies</strong> again.</dd>
<dt>
–ignore-length
</dt>
<dd>Unfortunately, some HTTP servers (CGI programs, to
be more precise) send out bogus <code class="verbatim">Content-Length</code> headers, which makes
Wget go wild, as it thinks not all the document was retrieved. You can
spot this syndrome if Wget retries getting the same document again and
again, each time claiming that the (otherwise normal) connection has
closed on the very same byte. With this option, Wget will ignore the
<code class="verbatim">Content-Length</code> header—as if it never existed.</dd>
<dt>
–header=header-line
</dt>
<dd>Send <em>header-line</em> along with the rest of the
headers in each HTTP request. The supplied header is sent as-is, which
means it must contain name and value separated by colon, and must not
contain newlines. You may define more than one additional header by
specifying <strong>–header</strong> more than once. wget –header=Accept-Charset:
iso-8859-2 \ –header=Accept-Language: hr \ <a href="http://fly.srk.fer.hr/">http://fly.srk.fer.hr/</a>
Specification of an empty string as the header value will clear all
previous user-defined headers. As of Wget 1.10, this option can be
used to override headers otherwise generated automatically. This
example instructs Wget to connect to localhost, but to specify
<strong>foo.bar</strong> in the <code class="verbatim">Host</code> header: wget –header=&#34;Host: foo.bar&#34;
<a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a> In versions of Wget prior to 1.10 such use of
<strong>–header</strong> caused sending of duplicate headers.</dd>
<dt>
–compression=type
</dt>
<dd>Choose the type of compression to be used. Legal
values are <strong>auto</strong>, <strong>gzip</strong> and <strong>none</strong>. If <strong>auto</strong> or <strong>gzip</strong> are
specified, Wget asks the server to compress the file using the gzip
compression format. If the server compresses the file and responds
with the <code class="verbatim">Content-Encoding</code> header field set appropriately, the file
will be decompressed automatically. If <strong>none</strong> is specified, wget will
not ask the server to compress the file and will not decompress any
server responses. This is the default. Compression support is
currently experimental. In case it is turned on, please report any
bugs to <code class="verbatim">bug-wget@gnu.org</code>.</dd>
<dt>
–max-redirect=number
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the maximum number of redirections
to follow for a resource. The default is 20, which is usually far more
than necessary. However, on those occasions where you want to allow
more (or fewer), this is the option to use.</dd>
<dt>
–proxy-user=user
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
–proxy-password=password
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Specify the username <em>user</em> and password <em>password</em> for authentication
on a proxy server. Wget will encode them using the <code class="verbatim">basic</code>
authentication scheme. Security considerations similar to those with
<strong>–http-password</strong> pertain here as well.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–referer=url
</dt>
<dd>Include `Referer: <em>url</em>&#39; header in HTTP request.
Useful for retrieving documents with server-side processing that
assume they are always being retrieved by interactive web browsers and
only come out properly when Referer is set to one of the pages that
point to them.</dd>
<dt>
–save-headers
</dt>
<dd>Save the headers sent by the HTTP server to the
file, preceding the actual contents, with an empty line as the
separator.</dd>
<dt>
-U agent-string
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
–user-agent=agent-string
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Identify as <em>agent-string</em> to the HTTP server. The HTTP protocol allows
the clients to identify themselves using a <code class="verbatim">User-Agent</code> header field.
This enables distinguishing the WWW software, usually for statistical
purposes or for tracing of protocol violations. Wget normally identifies
as *Wget/*/version/, <em>version</em> being the current version number of Wget.
However, some sites have been known to impose the policy of tailoring
the output according to the <code class="verbatim">User-Agent</code>-supplied information. While
this is not such a bad idea in theory, it has been abused by servers
denying information to clients other than (historically) Netscape or,
more frequently, Microsoft Internet Explorer. This option allows you to
change the <code class="verbatim">User-Agent</code> line issued by Wget. Use of this option is
discouraged, unless you really know what you are doing. Specifying empty
user agent with <strong>–user-agent=&#34;&#34;</strong> instructs Wget not to send the
<code class="verbatim">User-Agent</code> header in HTTP requests.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–post-data=string
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
–post-file=file
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Use POST as the method for all HTTP requests and send the specified data
in the request body. <strong>–post-data</strong> sends <em>string</em> as data, whereas
<strong>–post-file</strong> sends the contents of <em>file</em>. Other than that, they work
in exactly the same way. In particular, they <em>both</em> expect content of
the form <code class="verbatim">key1=value1&amp;key2=value2</code>, with percent-encoding for special
characters; the only difference is that one expects its content as a
command-line parameter and the other accepts its content from a file. In
particular, <strong>–post-file</strong> is <em>not</em> for transmitting files as form
attachments: those must appear as <code class="verbatim">key=value</code> data (with appropriate
percent-coding) just like everything else. Wget does not currently
support <code class="verbatim">multipart/form-data</code> for transmitting POST data; only
<code class="verbatim">application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. Only one of <strong>–post-data</strong> and
<strong>–post-file</strong> should be specified. Please note that wget does not
require the content to be of the form <code class="verbatim">key1=value1&amp;key2=value2</code>, and
neither does it test for it. Wget will simply transmit whatever data is
provided to it. Most servers however expect the POST data to be in the
above format when processing HTML Forms. When sending a POST request
using the <strong>–post-file</strong> option, Wget treats the file as a binary file
and will send every character in the POST request without stripping
trailing newline or formfeed characters. Any other control characters in
the text will also be sent as-is in the POST request. Please be aware
that Wget needs to know the size of the POST data in advance. Therefore
the argument to <code class="verbatim">--post-file</code> must be a regular file; specifying a FIFO
or something like <em>/dev/stdin</em> won&#39;t work. It&#39;s not quite clear how to
work around this limitation inherent in HTTP/1.0. Although HTTP/1.1
introduces <em>chunked</em> transfer that doesn&#39;t require knowing the request
length in advance, a client can&#39;t use chunked unless it knows it&#39;s
talking to an HTTP/1.1 server. And it can&#39;t know that until it receives
a response, which in turn requires the request to have been completed –
a chicken-and-egg problem. Note: As of version 1.15 if Wget is
redirected after the POST request is completed, its behaviour will
depend on the response code returned by the server. In case of a 301
Moved Permanently, 302 Moved Temporarily or 307 Temporary Redirect, Wget
will, in accordance with RFC2616, continue to send a POST request. In
case a server wants the client to change the Request method upon
redirection, it should send a 303 See Other response code. This example
shows how to log in to a server using POST and then proceed to download
the desired pages, presumably only accessible to authorized users: # Log
in to the server. This can be done only once. wget –save-cookies
cookies.txt \ –post-data user=foo&amp;password=bar \
<a href="http://example.com/auth.php">http://example.com/auth.php</a> # Now grab the page or pages we care about.
wget –load-cookies cookies.txt \ -p
<a href="http://example.com/interesting/article.php">http://example.com/interesting/article.php</a> If the server is using
session cookies to track user authentication, the above will not work
because <strong>–save-cookies</strong> will not save them (and neither will browsers)
and the <em>cookies.txt</em> file will be empty. In that case use
<strong>–keep-session-cookies</strong> along with <strong>–save-cookies</strong> to force saving of
session cookies.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–method=HTTP-Method
</dt>
<dd>For the purpose of RESTful scripting, Wget
allows sending of other HTTP Methods without the need to explicitly
set them using <strong>–header=Header-Line</strong>. Wget will use whatever string
is passed to it after <strong>–method</strong> as the HTTP Method to the server.</dd>
<dt>
–body-data=Data-String
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
–body-file=Data-File
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Must be set when additional data needs to be sent to the server along
with the Method specified using <strong>–method</strong>. <strong>–body-data</strong> sends <em>string</em>
as data, whereas <strong>–body-file</strong> sends the contents of <em>file</em>. Other than
that, they work in exactly the same way. Currently, <strong>–body-file</strong> is
<em>not</em> for transmitting files as a whole. Wget does not currently support
<code class="verbatim">multipart/form-data</code> for transmitting data; only
<code class="verbatim">application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. In the future, this may be changed
so that wget sends the <strong>–body-file</strong> as a complete file instead of
sending its contents to the server. Please be aware that Wget needs to
know the contents of BODY Data in advance, and hence the argument to
<strong>–body-file</strong> should be a regular file. See <strong>–post-file</strong> for a more
detailed explanation. Only one of <strong>–body-data</strong> and <strong>–body-file</strong> should
be specified. If Wget is redirected after the request is completed, Wget
will suspend the current method and send a GET request till the
redirection is completed. This is true for all redirection response
codes except 307 Temporary Redirect which is used to explicitly specify
that the request method should <em>not</em> change. Another exception is when
the method is set to <code class="verbatim">POST</code>, in which case the redirection rules
specified under <strong>–post-data</strong> are followed.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–content-disposition
</dt>
<dd>If this is set to on, experimental (not
fully-functional) support for <code class="verbatim">Content-Disposition</code> headers is
enabled. This can currently result in extra round-trips to the server
for a <code class="verbatim">HEAD</code> request, and is known to suffer from a few bugs, which is
why it is not currently enabled by default. This option is useful for
some file-downloading CGI programs that use <code class="verbatim">Content-Disposition</code>
headers to describe what the name of a downloaded file should be. When
combined with <strong>–metalink-over-http</strong> and <strong>–trust-server-names</strong>, a
<strong>Content-Type: application/metalink4+xml</strong> file is named using the
<code class="verbatim">Content-Disposition</code> filename field, if available.</dd>
<dt>
–content-on-error
</dt>
<dd>If this is set to on, wget will not skip the
content when the server responds with a http status code that
indicates error.</dd>
<dt>
–trust-server-names
</dt>
<dd>If this is set, on a redirect, the local file
name will be based on the redirection URL. By default the local file
name is based on the original URL. When doing recursive retrieving
this can be helpful because in many web sites redirected URLs
correspond to an underlying file structure, while link URLs do not.</dd>
<dt>
–auth-no-challenge
</dt>
<dd>If this option is given, Wget will send Basic
HTTP authentication information (plaintext username and password) for
all requests, just like Wget 1.10.2 and prior did by default. Use of
this option is not recommended, and is intended only to support some
few obscure servers, which never send HTTP authentication challenges,
but accept unsolicited auth info, say, in addition to form-based
authentication.</dd>
<dt>
–retry-on-host-error
</dt>
<dd>Consider host errors, such as &#34;Temporary
failure in name resolution&#34;, as non-fatal, transient errors.</dd>
<dt>
–retry-on-http-error=code[,code,…]
</dt>
<dd>Consider given HTTP response
codes as non-fatal, transient errors. Supply a comma-separated list of
3-digit HTTP response codes as argument. Useful to work around special
circumstances where retries are required, but the server responds with
an error code normally not retried by Wget. Such errors might be 503
(Service Unavailable) and 429 (Too Many Requests). Retries enabled by
this option are performed subject to the normal retry timing and retry
count limitations of Wget. Using this option is intended to support
special use cases only and is generally not recommended, as it can
force retries even in cases where the server is actually trying to
decrease its load. Please use wisely and only if you know what you are
doing.</dd>

HTTPS (SSL/TLS) Options

<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-3">
<p>To support encrypted HTTP (HTTPS) downloads, Wget must be compiled with
an external SSL library. The current default is GnuTLS. In addition,
Wget also supports HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security). If Wget is
compiled without SSL support, none of these options are available.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–secure-protocol=protocol
</dt>
<dd>Choose the secure protocol to be used.
Legal values are <strong>auto</strong>, <strong>SSLv2</strong>, <strong>SSLv3</strong>, <strong>TLSv1</strong>, <strong>TLSv1_1</strong>,
<strong>TLSv1_2</strong>, <strong>TLSv1_3</strong> and <strong>PFS</strong>. If <strong>auto</strong> is used, the SSL library is
given the liberty of choosing the appropriate protocol automatically,
which is achieved by sending a TLSv1 greeting. This is the default.
Specifying <strong>SSLv2</strong>, <strong>SSLv3</strong>, <strong>TLSv1</strong>, <strong>TLSv1_1</strong>, <strong>TLSv1_2</strong> or
<strong>TLSv1_3</strong> forces the use of the corresponding protocol. This is useful
when talking to old and buggy SSL server implementations that make it
hard for the underlying SSL library to choose the correct protocol
version. Fortunately, such servers are quite rare. Specifying <strong>PFS</strong>
enforces the use of the so-called Perfect Forward Security cipher
suites. In short, PFS adds security by creating a one-time key for
each SSL connection. It has a bit more CPU impact on client and
server. We use known to be secure ciphers (e.g. no MD4) and the TLS
protocol. This mode also explicitly excludes non-PFS key exchange
methods, such as RSA.</dd>
<dt>
–https-only
</dt>
<dd>When in recursive mode, only HTTPS links are followed.</dd>
<dt>
–ciphers
</dt>
<dd>Set the cipher list string. Typically this string sets
the cipher suites and other SSL/TLS options that the user wish should
be used, in a set order of preference (GnuTLS calls it &#39;priority
string&#39;). This string will be fed verbatim to the SSL/TLS engine
(OpenSSL or GnuTLS) and hence its format and syntax is dependent on
that. Wget will not process or manipulate it in any way. Refer to the
OpenSSL or GnuTLS documentation for more information.</dd>
<dt>
–no-check-certificate
</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t check the server certificate against
the available certificate authorities. Also don&#39;t require the URL host
name to match the common name presented by the certificate. As of Wget
1.10, the default is to verify the server&#39;s certificate against the
recognized certificate authorities, breaking the SSL handshake and
aborting the download if the verification fails. Although this
provides more secure downloads, it does break interoperability with
some sites that worked with previous Wget versions, particularly those
using self-signed, expired, or otherwise invalid certificates. This
option forces an &#34;insecure&#34; mode of operation that turns the
certificate verification errors into warnings and allows you to
proceed. If you encounter &#34;certificate verification&#34; errors or ones
saying that &#34;common name doesn&#39;t match requested host name&#34;, you can
use this option to bypass the verification and proceed with the
download. <em>Only use this option if you are otherwise convinced of the</em>
site&#39;s authenticity, or if you really don&#39;t care about the validity of
its certificate. It is almost always a bad idea not to check the
certificates when transmitting confidential or important data. For
self-signed/internal certificates, you should download the certificate
and verify against that instead of forcing this insecure mode. If you
are really sure of not desiring any certificate verification, you can
specify –check-certificate=quiet to tell wget to not print any
warning about invalid certificates, albeit in most cases this is the
wrong thing to do.</dd>
<dt>
–certificate=file
</dt>
<dd>Use the client certificate stored in <em>file</em>.
This is needed for servers that are configured to require certificates
from the clients that connect to them. Normally a certificate is not
required and this switch is optional.</dd>

–ca-certificate=file
</dt>
<dd>Use <em>file</em> as the file with the bundle of
certificate authorities (&#34;CA&#34;) to verify the peers. The certificates
must be in PEM format. Without this option Wget looks for CA
certificates at the system-specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL
installation time.</dd>
<dt>
–ca-directory=directory
</dt>
<dd>Specifies directory containing CA
certificates in PEM format. Each file contains one CA certificate, and
the file name is based on a hash value derived from the certificate.
This is achieved by processing a certificate directory with the
<code class="verbatim">c_rehash</code> utility supplied with OpenSSL. Using <strong>–ca-directory</strong> is
more efficient than <strong>–ca-certificate</strong> when many certificates are
installed because it allows Wget to fetch certificates on demand.
Without this option Wget looks for CA certificates at the
system-specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation time.</dd>
<dt>
–crl-file=file
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a CRL file in <em>file</em>. This is needed for
certificates that have been revocated by the CAs.</dd>
<dt>
–pinnedpubkey=file/hashes
</dt>
<dd>Tells wget to use the specified public
key file (or hashes) to verify the peer. This can be a path to a file
which contains a single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number
of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by &#34;sha256//&#34; and separated
by &#34;;&#34; When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a
certificate indicating its identity. A public key is extracted from
this certificate and if it does not exactly match the public key(s)
provided to this option, wget will abort the connection before sending
or receiving any data.</dd>
<dt>
–random-file=file
</dt>
<dd>[OpenSSL and LibreSSL only] Use <em>file</em> as the
source of random data for seeding the pseudo-random number generator

needs an external source of randomness to initialize. Randomness may
be provided by EGD (see <strong>–egd-file</strong> below) or read from an external
source specified by the user. If this option is not specified, Wget
looks for random data in <code class="verbatim">$RANDFILE</code> or, if that is unset, in
<em><code class="verbatim">$HOME</code></em>.rnd/. If you&#39;re getting the &#34;Could not seed OpenSSL PRNG;
disabling SSL.&#34; error, you should provide random data using some of
the methods described above.</dd>
<dt>
–egd-file=file
</dt>
<dd>[OpenSSL only] Use <em>file</em> as the EGD socket. EGD
stands for <em>Entropy</em> Gathering Daemon, a user-space program that
collects data from various unpredictable system sources and makes it
available to other programs that might need it. Encryption software,
such as the SSL library, needs sources of non-repeating randomness to
seed the random number generator used to produce cryptographically
strong keys. OpenSSL allows the user to specify his own source of
entropy using the <code class="verbatim">RAND_FILE</code> environment variable. If this variable
is unset, or if the specified file does not produce enough randomness,
OpenSSL will read random data from EGD socket specified using this
option. If this option is not specified (and the equivalent startup
command is not used), EGD is never contacted. EGD is not needed on
modern Unix systems that support <em>/dev/urandom</em>.</dd>
<dt>
–no-hsts
</dt>
<dd>Wget supports HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security,
RFC 6797) by default. Use <strong>–no-hsts</strong> to make Wget act as a
non-HSTS-compliant UA. As a consequence, Wget would ignore all the
<code class="verbatim">Strict-Transport-Security</code> headers, and would not enforce any
existing HSTS policy.</dd>
<dt>
–hsts-file=file
</dt>
<dd>By default, Wget stores its HSTS database in
<em>~</em>.wget-hsts/. You can use <strong>–hsts-file</strong> to override this. Wget will
use the supplied file as the HSTS database. Such file must conform to
the correct HSTS database format used by Wget. If Wget cannot parse
the provided file, the behaviour is unspecified. The Wget&#39;s HSTS
database is a plain text file. Each line contains an HSTS entry (ie. a
site that has issued a <code class="verbatim">Strict-Transport-Security</code> header and that
therefore has specified a concrete HSTS policy to be applied). Lines
starting with a dash (<code class="verbatim">#</code>) are ignored by Wget. Please note that in
spite of this convenient human-readability hand-hacking the HSTS
database is generally not a good idea. An HSTS entry line consists of
several fields separated by one or more whitespace:
<code class="verbatim">&lt;hostname&gt; SP [&lt;port&gt;] SP &lt;include subdomains&gt; SP &lt;created&gt; SP &lt;max-age&gt;</code>
The <em>hostname</em> and <em>port</em> fields indicate the hostname and port to
which the given HSTS policy applies. The <em>port</em> field may be zero, and
it will, in most of the cases. That means that the port number will
not be taken into account when deciding whether such HSTS policy
should be applied on a given request (only the hostname will be
evaluated). When <em>port</em> is different to zero, both the target hostname
and the port will be evaluated and the HSTS policy will only be
applied if both of them match. This feature has been included for
testing/development purposes only. The Wget testsuite (in <em>testenv/</em>)
creates HSTS databases with explicit ports with the purpose of
ensuring Wget&#39;s correct behaviour. Applying HSTS policies to ports
other than the default ones is discouraged by RFC 6797 (see Appendix B
&#34;Differences between HSTS Policy and Same-Origin Policy&#34;). Thus, this
functionality should not be used in production environments and <em>port</em>
will typically be zero. The last three fields do what they are
expected to. The field <em>include_subdomains</em> can either be <code class="verbatim">1</code> or <code class="verbatim">0</code>
and it signals whether the subdomains of the target domain should be
part of the given HSTS policy as well. The <em>created</em> and <em>max-age</em>
fields hold the timestamp values of when such entry was created (first
seen by Wget) and the HSTS-defined value &#39;max-age&#39;, which states how
long should that HSTS policy remain active, measured in seconds
elapsed since the timestamp stored in <em>created</em>. Once that time has
passed, that HSTS policy will no longer be valid and will eventually
be removed from the database. If you supply your own HSTS database via
<strong>–hsts-file</strong>, be aware that Wget may modify the provided file if any
change occurs between the HSTS policies requested by the remote
servers and those in the file. When Wget exits, it effectively updates
the HSTS database by rewriting the database file with the new entries.
If the supplied file does not exist, Wget will create one. This file
will contain the new HSTS entries. If no HSTS entries were generated
(no <code class="verbatim">Strict-Transport-Security</code> headers were sent by any of the
servers) then no file will be created, not even an empty one. This
behaviour applies to the default database file (<em>~</em>.wget-hsts/) as
well: it will not be created until some server enforces an HSTS
policy. Care is taken not to override possible changes made by other
Wget processes at the same time over the HSTS database. Before dumping
the updated HSTS entries on the file, Wget will re-read it and merge
the changes. Using a custom HSTS database and/or modifying an existing
one is discouraged. For more information about the potential security
threats arose from such practice, see section 14 &#34;Security
Considerations&#34; of RFC 6797, specially section 14.9 &#34;Creative
Manipulation of HSTS Policy Store&#34;.</dd>

FTP Options

<dl>
<dt>
–ftp-user=user
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
–ftp-password=password
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Specify the username <em>user</em> and password <em>password</em> on an FTP server.
Without this, or the corresponding startup option, the password defaults
to <strong>-wget@</strong>, normally used for anonymous FTP. Another way to specify
username and password is in the URL itself. Either method reveals your
password to anyone who bothers to run <code class="verbatim">ps</code>. To prevent the passwords
from being seen, store them in <em>.wgetrc</em> or <em>.netrc</em>, and make sure to
protect those files from other users with <code class="verbatim">chmod</code>. If the passwords are
really important, do not leave them lying in those files either—edit
the files and delete them after Wget has started the download.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–no-remove-listing
</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t remove the temporary <em>.listing</em> files
generated by FTP retrievals. Normally, these files contain the raw
directory listings received from FTP servers. Not removing them can be
useful for debugging purposes, or when you want to be able to easily
check on the contents of remote server directories (e.g. to verify
that a mirror you&#39;re running is complete). Note that even though Wget
writes to a known filename for this file, this is not a security hole
in the scenario of a user making <em>.listing</em> a symbolic link to
<em>/etc/passwd</em> or something and asking <code class="verbatim">root</code> to run Wget in his or her
directory. Depending on the options used, either Wget will refuse to
write to <em>.listing</em>, making the globbing/recursion/time-stamping
operation fail, or the symbolic link will be deleted and replaced with
the actual <em>.listing</em> file, or the listing will be written to a
<em>.listing.number</em> file. Even though this situation isn&#39;t a problem,
though, <code class="verbatim">root</code> should never run Wget in a non-trusted user&#39;s
directory. A user could do something as simple as linking <em>index.html</em>
to <em>/etc/passwd</em> and asking <code class="verbatim">root</code> to run Wget with <strong>-N</strong> or <strong>-r</strong> so
the file will be overwritten.</dd>
<dt>
–no-glob
</dt>
<dd>Turn off FTP globbing. Globbing refers to the use of
shell-like special characters (<em>wildcards</em>), like <strong>*</strong>, <strong>?</strong>, <strong>[</strong> and
<strong>]</strong> to retrieve more than one file from the same directory at once,
like: wget <a href="ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/*.msg">ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/*.msg</a> By default, globbing will be
turned on if the URL contains a globbing character. This option may be
used to turn globbing on or off permanently. You may have to quote the
URL to protect it from being expanded by your shell. Globbing makes
Wget look for a directory listing, which is system-specific. This is
why it currently works only with Unix FTP servers (and the ones
emulating Unix <code class="verbatim">ls</code> output).</dd>
<dt>
–no-passive-ftp
</dt>
<dd>Disable the use of the <em>passive</em> FTP transfer
mode. Passive FTP mandates that the client connect to the server to
establish the data connection rather than the other way around. If the
machine is connected to the Internet directly, both passive and active
FTP should work equally well. Behind most firewall and NAT
configurations passive FTP has a better chance of working. However, in
some rare firewall configurations, active FTP actually works when
passive FTP doesn&#39;t. If you suspect this to be the case, use this
option, or set <code class="verbatim">passive_ftp=off</code> in your init file.</dd>
<dt>
–preserve-permissions
</dt>
<dd>Preserve remote file permissions instead of
permissions set by umask.</dd>
<dt>
–retr-symlinks
</dt>
<dd>By default, when retrieving FTP directories
recursively and a symbolic link is encountered, the symbolic link is
traversed and the pointed-to files are retrieved. Currently, Wget does
not traverse symbolic links to directories to download them
recursively, though this feature may be added in the future. When
<strong>–retr-symlinks=no</strong> is specified, the linked-to file is not
downloaded. Instead, a matching symbolic link is created on the local
file system. The pointed-to file will not be retrieved unless this
recursive retrieval would have encountered it separately and
downloaded it anyway. This option poses a security risk where a
malicious FTP Server may cause Wget to write to files outside of the
intended directories through a specially crafted .LISTING file. Note
that when retrieving a file (not a directory) because it was specified
on the command-line, rather than because it was recursed to, this
option has no effect. Symbolic links are always traversed in this
case.</dd>

FTPS Options
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-3">
<dl>
<dt>
–ftps-implicit
</dt>
<dd>This option tells Wget to use FTPS implicitly.
Implicit FTPS consists of initializing SSL/TLS from the very beginning
of the control connection. This option does not send an <code class="verbatim">AUTH TLS</code>
command: it assumes the server speaks FTPS and directly starts an
SSL/TLS connection. If the attempt is successful, the session
continues just like regular FTPS (<code class="verbatim">PBSZ</code> and <code class="verbatim">PROT</code> are sent, etc.).
Implicit FTPS is no longer a requirement for FTPS implementations, and
thus many servers may not support it. If <strong>–ftps-implicit</strong> is passed
and no explicit port number specified, the default port for implicit
FTPS, 990, will be used, instead of the default port for the &#34;normal&#34;
(explicit) FTPS which is the same as that of FTP, 21.</dd>
<dt>
–no-ftps-resume-ssl
</dt>
<dd>Do not resume the SSL/TLS session in the data
channel. When starting a data connection, Wget tries to resume the
SSL/TLS session previously started in the control connection. SSL/TLS
session resumption avoids performing an entirely new handshake by
reusing the SSL/TLS parameters of a previous session. Typically, the
FTPS servers want it that way, so Wget does this by default. Under
rare circumstances however, one might want to start an entirely new
SSL/TLS session in every data connection. This is what
<strong>–no-ftps-resume-ssl</strong> is for.</dd>
<dt>
–ftps-clear-data-connection
</dt>
<dd>All the data connections will be in
plain text. Only the control connection will be under SSL/TLS. Wget
will send a <code class="verbatim">PROT C</code> command to achieve this, which must be approved
by the server.</dd>
<dt>
–ftps-fallback-to-ftp
</dt>
<dd>Fall back to FTP if FTPS is not supported by
the target server. For security reasons, this option is not asserted
by default. The default behaviour is to exit with an error. If a
server does not successfully reply to the initial <code class="verbatim">AUTH TLS</code> command,
or in the case of implicit FTPS, if the initial SSL/TLS connection
attempt is rejected, it is considered that such server does not
support FTPS.</dd>

Recursive Retrieval Options

<dl>
<dt>
-r

<dd></dd>
<dt>

</dl>
<p>Turn on recursive retrieving. The default maximum depth is 5.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-l depth
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
–level=depth
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Set the maximum number of subdirectories that Wget will recurse into to
<em>depth</em>. In order to prevent one from accidentally downloading very
large websites when using recursion this is limited to a depth of 5 by
default, i.e., it will traverse at most 5 directories deep starting from
the provided URL. Set <strong>-l 0</strong> or <strong>-l inf</strong> for infinite recursion depth.
wget -r -l 0 http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html Ideally, one would expect this to
download just <em>1.html</em>. but unfortunately this is not the case, because
<strong>-l 0</strong> is equivalent to <strong>-l inf</strong>—that is, infinite recursion. To
download a single HTML page (or a handful of them), specify them all on
the command line and leave away <strong>-r</strong> and <strong>-l</strong>. To download the essential
items to view a single HTML page, see <strong>page requisites</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–delete-after
</dt>
<dd>This option tells Wget to delete every single file
it downloads, <em>after</em> having done so. It is useful for pre-fetching
popular pages through a proxy, e.g.: wget -r -nd –delete-after
<a href="http://whatever.com/~popular/page/">http://whatever.com/~popular/page/</a> The <strong>-r</strong> option is to retrieve
recursively, and <strong>-nd</strong> to not create directories. Note that
<strong>–delete-after</strong> deletes files on the local machine. It does not issue
the <strong>DELE</strong> command to remote FTP sites, for instance. Also note that
when <strong>–delete-after</strong> is specified, <strong>–convert-links</strong> is ignored, so
<strong>.orig</strong> files are simply not created in the first place.</dd>
<dt>
-k
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
–convert-links
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>After the download is complete, convert the links in the document to
make them suitable for local viewing. This affects not only the visible
hyperlinks, but any part of the document that links to external content,
such as embedded images, links to style sheets, hyperlinks to non-HTML
content, etc. Each link will be changed in one of the two ways:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The links to files that have been downloaded by Wget will be changed
to refer to the file they point to as a relative link. Example: if the
downloaded file <em>/foo/doc.html</em> links to <em>/bar/img.gif</em>, also
downloaded, then the link in <em>doc.html</em> will be modified to point to
<strong>../bar/img.gif</strong>. This kind of transformation works reliably for
arbitrary combinations of directories.</li>
<li>The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget will be
changed to include host name and absolute path of the location they
point to. Example: if the downloaded file <em>/foo/doc.html</em> links to
<em>/bar/img.gif</em> (or to <em>../bar/img.gif</em>), then the link in <em>doc.html</em>
will be modified to point to <em><img src="http://hostname/bar/img.gif" alt="http://hostname/bar/img.gif" title="http://hostname/bar/img.gif" /></em>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked file was
downloaded, the link will refer to its local name; if it was not
downloaded, the link will refer to its full Internet address rather than
presenting a broken link. The fact that the former links are converted
to relative links ensures that you can move the downloaded hierarchy to
another directory. Note that only at the end of the download can Wget
know which links have been downloaded. Because of that, the work done by
<strong>-k</strong> will be performed at the end of all the downloads.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
–convert-file-only
</dt>
<dd>This option converts only the filename part of
the URLs, leaving the rest of the URLs untouched. This filename part
is sometimes referred to as the &#34;basename&#34;, although we avoid that
term here in order not to cause confusion. It works particularly well
in conjunction with <strong>–adjust-extension</strong>, although this coupling is
not enforced. It proves useful to populate Internet caches with files
downloaded from different hosts. Example: if some link points to
<em>//foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz</em> with <strong>–adjust-extension</strong> asserted and its
local destination is intended to be <em>./foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz.css</em>, then
the link would be converted to <em>//foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz.css</em>. Note that
only the filename part has been modified. The rest of the URL has been
left untouched, including the net path (<code class="verbatim">//</code>) which would otherwise be
processed by Wget and converted to the effective scheme (ie.
<code class="verbatim">http://</code>).</dd>

</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
–mirror
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Turn on options suitable for mirroring. This option turns on recursion
and time-stamping, sets infinite recursion depth and keeps FTP directory
listings. It is currently equivalent to <strong>-r -N -l inf
–no-remove-listing</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-p
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
–page-requisites
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>This option causes Wget to download all the files that are necessary to
properly display a given HTML page. This includes such things as inlined
images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets. Ordinarily, when downloading
a single HTML page, any requisite documents that may be needed to
display it properly are not downloaded. Using <strong>-r</strong> together with <strong>-l</strong>
can help, but since Wget does not ordinarily distinguish between
external and inlined documents, one is generally left with &#34;leaf
documents&#34; that are missing their requisites. For instance, say document
<em>1.html</em> contains an <code class="verbatim">&lt;IMG&gt;</code> tag referencing <em>1.gif</em> and an <code class="verbatim">&lt;A&gt;</code> tag
pointing to external document <em>2.html</em>. Say that <em>2.html</em> is similar but
that its image is <em>2.gif</em> and it links to <em>3.html</em>. Say this continues
up to some arbitrarily high number. If one executes the command: wget -r
-l 2 http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html then <em>1.html</em>, <em>1.gif</em>, <em>2.html</em>, <em>2.gif</em>, and
<em>3.html</em> will be downloaded. As you can see, <em>3.html</em> is without its
requisite <em>3.gif</em> because Wget is simply counting the number of hops (up
to 2) away from <em>1.html</em> in order to determine where to stop the
recursion. However, with this command: wget -r -l 2 -p
http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html all the above files <em>and</em> <em>3.html</em>&#39;s requisite
<em>3.gif</em> will be downloaded. Similarly, wget -r -l 1 -p
http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html will cause <em>1.html</em>, <em>1.gif</em>, <em>2.html</em>, and <em>2.gif</em>
to be downloaded. One might think that: wget -r -l 0 -p
http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html would download just <em>1.html</em> and <em>1.gif</em>, but
unfortunately this is not the case, because <strong>-l 0</strong> is equivalent to <strong>-l
inf</strong>—that is, infinite recursion. To download a single HTML page (or a
handful of them, all specified on the command-line or in a <strong>-i</strong> URL
input file) and its (or their) requisites, simply leave off <strong>-r</strong> and
<strong>-l</strong>: wget -p http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html Note that Wget will behave as if <strong>-r</strong>
had been specified, but only that single page and its requisites will be
downloaded. Links from that page to external documents will not be
followed. Actually, to download a single page and all its requisites
(even if they exist on separate websites), and make sure the lot
displays properly locally, this author likes to use a few options in
addition to <strong>-p</strong>: wget -E -H -k -K -p http://&lt;site&gt;/&lt;document&gt; To finish
off this topic, it&#39;s worth knowing that Wget&#39;s idea of an external
document link is any URL specified in an <code class="verbatim">&lt;A&gt;</code> tag, an <code class="verbatim">&lt;AREA&gt;</code> tag, or
a <code class="verbatim">&lt;LINK&gt;</code> tag other than <code class="verbatim">&lt;LINK</code> REL=&#34;stylesheet&#34;&gt;.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–strict-comments
</dt>
<dd>Turn on strict parsing of HTML comments. The
default is to terminate comments at the first occurrence of <strong>–&gt;</strong>.
According to specifications, HTML comments are expressed as SGML
<em>declarations</em>. Declaration is special markup that begins with <strong>&lt;!</strong>
and ends with <strong>&gt;</strong>, such as <strong>&lt;!DOCTYPE …&gt;</strong>, that may contain comments
between a pair of <strong>–</strong> delimiters. HTML comments are &#34;empty
declarations&#34;, SGML declarations without any non-comment text.
Therefore, <strong>&lt;!–foo–&gt;</strong> is a valid comment, and so is <strong>&lt;!–one–
–two–&gt;</strong>, but <strong>&lt;!–1–2–&gt;</strong> is not. On the other hand, most HTML
writers don&#39;t perceive comments as anything other than text delimited
with <strong>&lt;!–</strong> and <strong>–&gt;</strong>, which is not quite the same. For example,
something like <strong>&lt;!————&gt;</strong> works as a valid comment as long as
the number of dashes is a multiple of four (!). If not, the comment
technically lasts until the next <strong>–</strong>, which may be at the other end
of the document. Because of this, many popular browsers completely
ignore the specification and implement what users have come to expect:
comments delimited with <strong>&lt;!–</strong> and <strong>–&gt;</strong>. Until version 1.9, Wget
interpreted comments strictly, which resulted in missing links in many
web pages that displayed fine in browsers, but had the misfortune of
containing non-compliant comments. Beginning with version 1.9, Wget
has joined the ranks of clients that implements &#34;naive&#34; comments,
terminating each comment at the first occurrence of <strong>–&gt;</strong>. If, for
whatever reason, you want strict comment parsing, use this option to
turn it on.</dd>

author of this option came across a page with tags like
<code class="verbatim">&lt;LINK REL</code>&#34;home&#34; HREF=&#34;/&#34;&gt;= and came to the realization that
specifying tags to ignore was not enough. One can&#39;t just tell Wget to

info (how to subscribe, list archives, …).</p>
<p>
Before actually submitting a bug report, please try to follow a few
simple guidelines.</p>
<ol>
<li>Please try to ascertain that the behavior you see really is a bug. If
Wget crashes, it&#39;s a bug. If Wget does not behave as documented, it&#39;s
a bug. If things work strange, but you are not sure about the way
they are supposed to work, it might well be a bug, but you might want
to double-check the documentation and the mailing lists.</li>
<li>Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as possible. E.g. if
Wget crashes while downloading <strong>wget -rl0 -kKE -t5 –no-proxy</strong>
<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a> -o /tmp/log, you should try to see if the crash is
repeatable, and if will occur with a simpler set of options. You
might even try to start the download at the page where the crash
occurred to see if that page somehow triggered the crash. Also, while
I will probably be interested to know the contents of your <em>.wgetrc</em>
file, just dumping it into the debug message is probably a bad idea.
Instead, you should first try to see if the bug repeats with
<em>.wgetrc</em> moved out of the way. Only if it turns out that <em>.wgetrc</em>
settings affect the bug, mail me the relevant parts of the file.</li>
<li>Please start Wget with <strong>-d</strong> option and send us the resulting output
(or relevant parts thereof). If Wget was compiled without debug
support, recompile it—it is <em>much</em> easier to trace bugs with debug
support on. Note: please make sure to remove any potentially
sensitive information from the debug log before sending it to the bug
address. The <code class="verbatim">-d</code> won&#39;t go out of its way to collect sensitive
information, but the log <em>will</em> contain a fairly complete transcript
of Wget&#39;s communication with the server, which may include passwords
and pieces of downloaded data. Since the bug address is publicly
archived, you may assume that all bug reports are visible to the
public.</li>
<li>If Wget has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g. <code class="verbatim">gdb `which</code>
wget` core and type <code class="verbatim">where</code> to get the backtrace. This may not work
if the system administrator has disabled core files, but it is safe
to try.</li>
