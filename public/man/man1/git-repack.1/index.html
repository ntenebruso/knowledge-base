DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>This command is used to combine all objects that do not currently reside
in a &#34;pack&#34;, into a pack. It can also be used to re-organize existing
packs into a single, more efficient pack.</p>
<p>
A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with delta
compression applied, stored in a single file, with an associated index
file.</p>
<p>
Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines,
disk storage, etc.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>-a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of incrementally packing the unpacked objects, pack everything
referenced into a single pack. Especially useful when packing a
repository that is used for private development. Use with <strong>-d</strong>. This
will clean up the objects that <strong>git prune</strong> leaves behind, but <strong>git fsck
–full –dangling</strong> shows as dangling.</p>
<p>
Note that users fetching over dumb protocols will have to fetch the
whole new pack in order to get any contained object, no matter how many
other objects in that pack they already have locally.</p>
<p>
Promisor packfiles are repacked separately: if there are packfiles that
have an associated &#34;.promisor&#34; file, these packfiles will be repacked
into another separate pack, and an empty &#34;.promisor&#34; file corresponding
to the new separate pack will be written.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-A</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Same as <strong>-a</strong>, unless <strong>-d</strong> is used. Then any unreachable objects in a
previous pack become loose, unpacked objects, instead of being left in
the old pack. Unreachable objects are never intentionally added to a
pack, even when repacking. This option prevents unreachable objects from
being immediately deleted by way of being left in the old pack and then
removed. Instead, the loose unreachable objects will be pruned according
to normal expiry rules with the next <em>git gc</em> invocation. See
*git-gc*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-d</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After packing, if the newly created packs make some existing packs
redundant, remove the redundant packs. Also run <em>git prune-packed</em> to
remove redundant loose object files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–cruft</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Same as <strong>-a</strong>, unless <strong>-d</strong> is used. Then any unreachable objects are
packed into a separate cruft pack. Unreachable objects can be pruned
using the normal expiry rules with the next <strong>git gc</strong> invocation (see
<strong>git-gc*(1)). Incompatible with *-k</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–cruft-expiration=&lt;approxidate&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Expire unreachable objects older than <strong>&lt;approxidate&gt;</strong> immediately
instead of waiting for the next <strong>git gc</strong> invocation. Only useful with
<strong>–cruft -d</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–max-cruft-size=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Repack cruft objects into packs as large as <strong>&lt;n&gt;</strong> bytes before creating
new packs. As long as there are enough cruft packs smaller than <strong>&lt;n&gt;</strong>,
repacking will cause a new cruft pack to be created containing objects
from any combined cruft packs, along with any new unreachable objects.
Cruft packs larger than <strong>&lt;n&gt;</strong> will not be modified. When the new cruft
pack is larger than <strong>&lt;n&gt;</strong> bytes, it will be split into multiple packs,
all of which are guaranteed to be at most <strong>&lt;n&gt;</strong> bytes in size. Only
useful with <strong>–cruft -d</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–expire-to=&lt;dir&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a cruft pack containing pruned objects (if any) to the directory
<strong>&lt;dir&gt;</strong>. This option is useful for keeping a copy of any pruned objects
in a separate directory as a backup. Only useful with <strong>–cruft -d</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-l</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pass the <strong>–local</strong> option to <em>git pack-objects</em>. See
*git-pack-objects*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-f</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pass the <strong>–no-reuse-delta</strong> option to <strong>git-pack-objects</strong>, see
*git-pack-objects*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-F</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pass the <strong>–no-reuse-object</strong> option to <strong>git-pack-objects</strong>, see
*git-pack-objects*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-q, –quiet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show no progress over the standard error stream and pass the <strong>-q</strong> option
to <em>git pack-objects</em>. See *git-pack-objects*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-n</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not update the server information with <em>git update-server-info</em>. This
option skips updating local catalog files needed to publish this
repository (or a direct copy of it) over HTTP or FTP. See
*git-update-server-info*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–window=&lt;n&gt;, –depth=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These two options affect how the objects contained in the pack are
stored using delta compression. The objects are first internally sorted
by type, size and optionally names and compared against the other
objects within <strong>–window</strong> to see if using delta compression saves space.
<strong>–depth</strong> limits the maximum delta depth; making it too deep affects the
performance on the unpacker side, because delta data needs to be applied
that many times to get to the necessary object.</p>
<p>
The default value for –window is 10 and –depth is 50. The maximum
depth is 4095.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–threads=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is passed through to <strong>git pack-objects</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–window-memory=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option provides an additional limit on top of <strong>–window</strong>; the
window size will dynamically scale down so as to not take up more than
<em>&lt;n&gt;</em> bytes in memory. This is useful in repositories with a mix of
large and small objects to not run out of memory with a large window,
but still be able to take advantage of the large window for the smaller
objects. The size can be suffixed with &#34;k&#34;, &#34;m&#34;, or &#34;g&#34;.
<strong>–window-memory=0</strong> makes memory usage unlimited. The default is taken
from the <strong>pack.windowMemory</strong> configuration variable. Note that the
actual memory usage will be the limit multiplied by the number of
threads used by *git-pack-objects*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–max-pack-size=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maximum size of each output pack file. The size can be suffixed with
&#34;k&#34;, &#34;m&#34;, or &#34;g&#34;. The minimum size allowed is limited to 1 MiB. If
specified, multiple packfiles may be created, which also prevents the
creation of a bitmap index. The default is unlimited, unless the config
variable <strong>pack.packSizeLimit</strong> is set. Note that this option may result
in a larger and slower repository; see the discussion in
<strong>pack.packSizeLimit</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–filter=&lt;filter-spec&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remove objects matching the filter specification from the resulting
packfile and put them into a separate packfile. Note that objects used
in the working directory are not filtered out. So for the split to fully
work, it&#39;s best to perform it in a bare repo and to use the <strong>-a</strong> and
<strong>-d</strong> options along with this option. Also <strong>–no-write-bitmap-index</strong> (or
the <strong>repack.writebitmaps</strong> config option set to <strong>false</strong>) should be used
otherwise writing bitmap index will fail, as it supposes a single
packfile containing all the objects. See <strong>git-rev-list*(1) for valid
*&lt;filter-spec&gt;</strong> forms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–filter-to=&lt;dir&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write the pack containing filtered out objects to the directory <strong>&lt;dir&gt;</strong>.
Only useful with <strong>–filter</strong>. This can be used for putting the pack on a
separate object directory that is accessed through the Git alternates
mechanism. <strong>WARNING:</strong> If the packfile containing the filtered out
objects is not accessible, the repo can become corrupt as it might not
be possible to access the objects in that packfile. See the <strong>objects</strong>
and <strong>objects/info/alternates</strong> sections of *gitrepository-layout*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-b, –write-bitmap-index</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a reachability bitmap index as part of the repack. This only makes
sense when used with <strong>-a</strong>, <strong>-A</strong> or <strong>-m</strong>, as the bitmaps must be able to
refer to all reachable objects. This option overrides the setting of
<strong>repack.writeBitmaps</strong>. This option has no effect if multiple packfiles
are created, unless writing a MIDX (in which case a multi-pack bitmap is
created).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–pack-kept-objects</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Include objects in <strong>.keep</strong> files when repacking. Note that we still do
not delete <strong>.keep</strong> packs after <strong>pack-objects</strong> finishes. This means that
we may duplicate objects, but this makes the option safe to use when
there are concurrent pushes or fetches. This option is generally only
useful if you are writing bitmaps with <strong>-b</strong> or <strong>repack.writeBitmaps</strong>, as
it ensures that the bitmapped packfile has the necessary objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–keep-pack=&lt;pack-name&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exclude the given pack from repacking. This is the equivalent of having
<strong>.keep</strong> file on the pack. <strong>&lt;pack-name&gt;</strong> is the pack file name without
leading directory (e.g. <strong>pack-123.pack</strong>). The option can be specified
multiple times to keep multiple packs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–unpack-unreachable=&lt;when&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When loosening unreachable objects, do not bother loosening any objects
older than <strong>&lt;when&gt;</strong>. This can be used to optimize out the write of any
objects that would be immediately pruned by a follow-up <strong>git prune</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-k, –keep-unreachable</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When used with <strong>-ad</strong>, any unreachable objects from existing packs will
be appended to the end of the packfile instead of being removed. In
addition, any unreachable loose objects will be packed (and their loose
counterparts removed).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-i, –delta-islands</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pass the <strong>–delta-islands</strong> option to <strong>git-pack-objects</strong>, see
*git-pack-objects*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-g&lt;factor&gt;, –geometric=&lt;factor&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arrange resulting pack structure so that each successive pack contains
at least <strong>&lt;factor&gt;</strong> times the number of objects as the next-largest
pack.</p>
<p>
<strong>git repack</strong> ensures this by determining a &#34;cut&#34; of packfiles that need
to be repacked into one in order to ensure a geometric progression. It
picks the smallest set of packfiles such that as many of the larger
packfiles (by count of objects contained in that pack) may be left
intact.</p>
<p>
Unlike other repack modes, the set of objects to pack is determined
uniquely by the set of packs being &#34;rolled-up&#34;; in other words, the
packs determined to need to be combined in order to restore a geometric
progression.</p>
<p>
Loose objects are implicitly included in this &#34;roll-up&#34;, without respect
to their reachability. This is subject to change in the future.</p>
<p>
When writing a multi-pack bitmap, <strong>git repack</strong> selects the largest
resulting pack as the preferred pack for object selection by the MIDX
(see *git-multi-pack-index*(1)).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-m, –write-midx</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a multi-pack index (see *git-multi-pack-index*(1)) containing the
non-redundant packs.</p>

CONFIGURATION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Various configuration variables affect packing, see *git-config*(1)
(search for &#34;pack&#34; and &#34;delta&#34;).</p>
<p>
By default, the command passes <strong>–delta-base-offset</strong> option to <em>git
pack-objects</em>; this typically results in slightly smaller packs, but the
generated packs are incompatible with versions of Git older than version
1.4.4. If you need to share your repository with such ancient Git
versions, either directly or via the dumb http protocol, then you need
to set the configuration variable <strong>repack.UseDeltaBaseOffset</strong> to &#34;false&#34;
and repack. Access from old Git versions over the native protocol is
unaffected by this option as the conversion is performed on the fly as
needed in that case.</p>
<p>
Delta compression is not used on objects larger than the
<strong>core.bigFileThreshold</strong> configuration variable and on files with the
attribute <strong>delta</strong> set to false.</p>
