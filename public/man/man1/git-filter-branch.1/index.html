WARNING
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><em>git filter-branch</em> has a plethora of pitfalls that can produce
non-obvious manglings of the intended history rewrite (and can leave you
with little time to investigate such problems since it has such abysmal
performance). These safety and performance issues cannot be backward
compatibly fixed and as such, its use is not recommended. Please use an
alternative history filtering tool such as <strong>git filter-repo</strong>[1]. If you
still need to use <em>git filter-branch</em>, please carefully read the section
called “SAFETY” (and the section called “PERFORMANCE”) to learn about
the land mines of filter-branch, and then vigilantly avoid as many of
the hazards listed there as reasonably possible.</p>

DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Lets you rewrite Git revision history by rewriting the branches
mentioned in the &lt;rev-list-options&gt;, applying custom filters on each
revision. Those filters can modify each tree (e.g. removing a file or
running a perl rewrite on all files) or information about each commit.
Otherwise, all information (including original commit times or merge
information) will be preserved.</p>
<p>
The command will only rewrite the <em>positive</em> refs mentioned in the
command line (e.g. if you pass <em>a..b</em>, only <em>b</em> will be rewritten). If
you specify no filters, the commits will be recommitted without any
changes, which would normally have no effect. Nevertheless, this may be
useful in the future for compensating for some Git bugs or such,
therefore such a usage is permitted.</p>
<p>
<strong>NOTE</strong>: This command honors <strong>.git/info/grafts</strong> file and refs in the
<strong>refs/replace/</strong> namespace. If you have any grafts or replacement refs
defined, running this command will make them permanent.</p>
<p>
<strong>WARNING</strong>! The rewritten history will have different object names for
all the objects and will not converge with the original branch. You will
not be able to easily push and distribute the rewritten branch on top of
the original branch. Please do not use this command if you do not know
the full implications, and avoid using it anyway, if a simple single
commit would suffice to fix your problem. (See the &#34;RECOVERING FROM
UPSTREAM REBASE&#34; section in *git-rebase*(1) for further information
about rewriting published history.)</p>
<p>
Always verify that the rewritten version is correct: The original refs,
if different from the rewritten ones, will be stored in the namespace
<em>refs/original/</em>.</p>
<p>
Note that since this operation is very I/O expensive, it might be a good
idea to redirect the temporary directory off-disk with the <strong>-d</strong> option,
e.g. on tmpfs. Reportedly the speedup is very noticeable.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-5">
Filters
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The filters are applied in the order as listed below. The &lt;command&gt;
argument is always evaluated in the shell context using the <em>eval</em>
command (with the notable exception of the commit filter, for technical
reasons). Prior to that, the <strong>$GIT_COMMIT</strong> environment variable will be
set to contain the id of the commit being rewritten. Also,
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL, GIT_AUTHOR_DATE, GIT_COMMITTER_NAME,
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL, and GIT_COMMITTER_DATE are taken from the current
commit and exported to the environment, in order to affect the author
and committer identities of the replacement commit created by
*git-commit-tree*(1) after the filters have run.</p>
<p>
If any evaluation of &lt;command&gt; returns a non-zero exit status, the whole
operation will be aborted.</p>
<p>
A <em>map</em> function is available that takes an &#34;original sha1 id&#34; argument
and outputs a &#34;rewritten sha1 id&#34; if the commit has been already
rewritten, and &#34;original sha1 id&#34; otherwise; the <em>map</em> function can
return several ids on separate lines if your commit filter emitted
multiple commits.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>–setup &lt;command&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not a real filter executed for each commit but a one time setup
just before the loop. Therefore no commit-specific variables are defined
yet. Functions or variables defined here can be used or modified in the
following filter steps except the commit filter, for technical reasons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–subdirectory-filter &lt;directory&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only look at the history which touches the given subdirectory. The
result will contain that directory (and only that) as its project root.
Implies the section called “Remap to ancestor”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–env-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This filter may be used if you only need to modify the environment in
which the commit will be performed. Specifically, you might want to
rewrite the author/committer name/email/time environment variables (see
*git-commit-tree*(1) for details).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–tree-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the filter for rewriting the tree and its contents. The argument
is evaluated in shell with the working directory set to the root of the
checked out tree. The new tree is then used as-is (new files are
auto-added, disappeared files are auto-removed - neither .gitignore
files nor any other ignore rules <strong>HAVE ANY EFFECT</strong>!).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–index-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the filter for rewriting the index. It is similar to the tree
filter but does not check out the tree, which makes it much faster.
Frequently used with <strong>git rm –cached –ignore-unmatch …</strong>, see
EXAMPLES below. For hairy cases, see *git-update-index*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–parent-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the filter for rewriting the commit&#39;s parent list. It will
receive the parent string on stdin and shall output the new parent
string on stdout. The parent string is in the format described in
*git-commit-tree*(1): empty for the initial commit, &#34;-p parent&#34; for a
normal commit and &#34;-p parent1 -p parent2 -p parent3 …&#34; for a merge
commit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–msg-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the filter for rewriting the commit messages. The argument is
evaluated in the shell with the original commit message on standard
input; its standard output is used as the new commit message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–commit-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the filter for performing the commit. If this filter is
specified, it will be called instead of the <em>git commit-tree</em> command,
with arguments of the form &#34;&lt;TREE_ID&gt; [(-p &lt;PARENT_COMMIT_ID&gt;)…]&#34; and
the log message on stdin. The commit id is expected on stdout.</p>
<p>
As a special extension, the commit filter may emit multiple commit ids;
in that case, the rewritten children of the original commit will have
all of them as parents.</p>
<p>
You can use the <em>map</em> convenience function in this filter, and other
convenience functions, too. For example, calling <em>skip_commit &#34;$@&#34;</em> will
leave out the current commit (but not its changes! If you want that, use
<em>git rebase</em> instead).</p>
<p>
You can also use the <strong>git_commit_non_empty_tree &#34;$@&#34;</strong> instead of <strong>git
commit-tree &#34;$@&#34;</strong> if you don&#39;t wish to keep commits with a single parent
and that makes no change to the tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–tag-name-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the filter for rewriting tag names. When passed, it will be
called for every tag ref that points to a rewritten object (or to a tag
object which points to a rewritten object). The original tag name is
passed via standard input, and the new tag name is expected on standard
output.</p>
<p>
The original tags are not deleted, but can be overwritten; use
&#34;–tag-name-filter cat&#34; to simply update the tags. In this case, be very
careful and make sure you have the old tags backed up in case the
conversion has run afoul.</p>
<p>
Nearly proper rewriting of tag objects is supported. If the tag has a
message attached, a new tag object will be created with the same
message, author, and timestamp. If the tag has a signature attached, the
signature will be stripped. It is by definition impossible to preserve
signatures. The reason this is &#34;nearly&#34; proper, is because ideally if
the tag did not change (points to the same object, has the same name,
etc.) it should retain any signature. That is not the case, signatures
will always be removed, buyer beware. There is also no support for
changing the author or timestamp (or the tag message for that matter).
Tags which point to other tags will be rewritten to point to the
underlying commit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–prune-empty</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some filters will generate empty commits that leave the tree untouched.
This option instructs git-filter-branch to remove such commits if they
have exactly one or zero non-pruned parents; merge commits will
therefore remain intact. This option cannot be used together with
<strong>–commit-filter</strong>, though the same effect can be achieved by using the
provided <strong>git_commit_non_empty_tree</strong> function in a commit filter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–original &lt;namespace&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use this option to set the namespace where the original commits will be
stored. The default value is <em>refs/original</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-d &lt;directory&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use this option to set the path to the temporary directory used for
rewriting. When applying a tree filter, the command needs to temporarily
check out the tree to some directory, which may consume considerable
space in case of large projects. By default it does this in the
<strong>.git-rewrite/</strong> directory but you can override that choice by this
parameter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-f, –force</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>git filter-branch</em> refuses to start with an existing temporary
directory or when there are already refs starting with <em>refs/original/</em>,
unless forced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–state-branch &lt;branch&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option will cause the mapping from old to new objects to be loaded
from named branch upon startup and saved as a new commit to that branch
upon exit, enabling incremental of large trees. If <em>&lt;branch&gt;</em> does not
exist it will be created.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;rev-list options&gt;…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arguments for <em>git rev-list</em>. All positive refs included by these
options are rewritten. You may also specify options such as <strong>–all</strong>, but
you must use <strong>–</strong> to separate them from the <em>git filter-branch</em> options.
Implies the section called “Remap to ancestor”.</p>

Remap to ancestor
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>By using *git-rev-list*(1) arguments, e.g., path limiters, you can limit
the set of revisions which get rewritten. However, positive refs on the
command line are distinguished: we don&#39;t let them be excluded by such
limiters. For this purpose, they are instead rewritten to point at the
nearest ancestor that was not excluded.</p>

<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>On success, the exit status is <strong>0</strong>. If the filter can&#39;t find any commits

EXAMPLES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Suppose you want to remove a file (containing confidential information
or copyright violation) from all commits:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git filter-branch --tree-filter rm filename HEAD
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, if the file is absent from the tree of some commit, a simple
<strong>rm filename</strong> will fail for that tree and commit. Thus you may instead
want to use <strong>rm -f filename</strong> as the script.</p>
<p>
Using <strong>–index-filter</strong> with <em>git rm</em> yields a significantly faster
version. Like with using <strong>rm filename</strong>, <strong>git rm –cached filename</strong> will
fail if the file is absent from the tree of a commit. If you want to
&#34;completely forget&#34; a file, it does not matter when it entered history,
so we also add <strong>–ignore-unmatch</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git filter-branch --index-filter git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch filename HEAD
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now, you will get the rewritten history saved in HEAD.</p>
<p>
To rewrite the repository to look as if <strong>foodir/</strong> had been its project
root, and discard all other history:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter foodir -- --all
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Thus you can, e.g., turn a library subdirectory into a repository of its
own. Note the <strong>–</strong> that separates <em>filter-branch</em> options from revision
options, and the <strong>–all</strong> to rewrite all branches and tags.</p>
<p>
To set a commit (which typically is at the tip of another history) to be
the parent of the current initial commit, in order to paste the other
history behind the current history:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git filter-branch --parent-filter sed &#34;s/^\$/-p &lt;graft-id&gt;/&#34; HEAD
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
(if the parent string is empty - which happens when we are dealing with
the initial commit - add graftcommit as a parent). Note that this
assumes history with a single root (that is, no merge without common
ancestors happened). If this is not the case, use:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git filter-branch --parent-filter \
        test $GIT_COMMIT = &lt;commit-id&gt; &amp;&amp; echo &#34;-p &lt;graft-id&gt;&#34; || cat HEAD
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
or even simpler:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git replace --graft $commit-id $graft-id
git filter-branch $graft-id..HEAD
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
To remove commits authored by &#34;Darl McBribe&#34; from the history:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git filter-branch --commit-filter 
        if [ &#34;$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME&#34; = &#34;Darl McBribe&#34; ];
        then
                skip_commit &#34;$@&#34;;
        else
                git commit-tree &#34;$@&#34;;
        fi HEAD
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The function <em>skip_commit</em> is defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
skip_commit()
{
        shift;
        while [ -n &#34;$1&#34; ];
        do
                shift;
                map &#34;$1&#34;;
                shift;
        done;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The shift magic first throws away the tree id and then the -p
parameters. Note that this handles merges properly! In case Darl
committed a merge between P1 and P2, it will be propagated properly and
all children of the merge will become merge commits with P1,P2 as their
parents instead of the merge commit.</p>
<p>
<strong>NOTE</strong> the changes introduced by the commits, and which are not reverted
by subsequent commits, will still be in the rewritten branch. If you
want to throw out <em>changes</em> together with the commits, you should use
the interactive mode of <em>git rebase</em>.</p>
<p>
You can rewrite the commit log messages using <strong>–msg-filter</strong>. For
example, <em>git svn-id</em> strings in a repository created by <em>git svn</em> can
be removed this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git filter-branch --msg-filter 
        sed -e &#34;/^git-svn-id:/d&#34;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you need to add <em>Acked-by</em> lines to, say, the last 10 commits (none
of which is a merge), use this command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git filter-branch --msg-filter 
        cat &amp;&amp;
        echo &#34;Acked-by: Bugs Bunny &lt;bunny@bugzilla.org&gt;&#34;
 HEAD~10..HEAD
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <strong>–env-filter</strong> option can be used to modify committer and/or author
identity. For example, if you found out that your commits have the wrong
identity due to a misconfigured user.email, you can make a correction,
before publishing the project, like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git filter-branch --env-filter 
        if test &#34;$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL&#34; = &#34;root@localhost&#34;
        then
                GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=john@example.com
        fi
        if test &#34;$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL&#34; = &#34;root@localhost&#34;
        then
                GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=john@example.com
        fi
 -- --all
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
To restrict rewriting to only part of the history, specify a revision
range in addition to the new branch name. The new branch name will point
to the top-most revision that a <em>git rev-list</em> of this range will print.</p>
<p>
Consider this history:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
     D--E--F--G--H
    /     /
A--B-----C
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
To rewrite only commits D,E,F,G,H, but leave A, B and C alone, use:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git filter-branch ... C..H
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
To rewrite commits E,F,G,H, use one of these:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git filter-branch ... C..H --not D
git filter-branch ... D..H --not C
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
To move the whole tree into a subdirectory, or remove it from there:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git filter-branch --index-filter \
        git ls-files -s | sed &#34;s-\t\&#34;*-&amp;newsubdir/-&#34; |
                GIT_INDEX_FILE=$GIT_INDEX_FILE.new \
                        git update-index --index-info &amp;&amp;
         mv &#34;$GIT_INDEX_FILE.new&#34; &#34;$GIT_INDEX_FILE&#34; HEAD
</pre>

CHECKLIST FOR SHRINKING A REPOSITORY
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-2">
<p>git-filter-branch can be used to get rid of a subset of files, usually
with some combination of <strong>–index-filter</strong> and <strong>–subdirectory-filter</strong>.
People expect the resulting repository to be smaller than the original,
but you need a few more steps to actually make it smaller, because Git
tries hard not to lose your objects until you tell it to. First make
sure that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
You really removed all variants of a filename, if a blob was moved over
its lifetime. <strong>git log –name-only –follow –all – filename</strong> can help
you find renames.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
You really filtered all refs: use <strong>–tag-name-filter cat – –all</strong> when
calling git-filter-branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then there are two ways to get a smaller repository. A safer way is to
clone, that keeps your original intact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Clone it with <strong>git clone <a href="///path/to/repo">///path/to/repo</a></strong>. The clone will not have
the removed objects. See *git-clone*(1). (Note that cloning with a plain
path just hardlinks everything!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you really don&#39;t want to clone it, for whatever reasons, check the
following points instead (in this order). This is a very destructive
approach, so <strong>make a backup</strong> or go back to cloning it. You have been
warned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Remove the original refs backed up by git-filter-branch: say *git
for-each-ref –format=&#34;%(refname)&#34; refs/original/ | xargs -n 1 git
update-ref -d*.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Expire all reflogs with <strong>git reflog expire –expire=now –all</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Garbage collect all unreferenced objects with <strong>git gc –prune=now</strong> (or
if your git-gc is not new enough to support arguments to <strong>–prune</strong>, use
<strong>git repack -ad; git prune</strong> instead).</p>

PERFORMANCE
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The performance of git-filter-branch is glacially slow; its design makes
it impossible for a backward-compatible implementation to ever be fast:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
In editing files, git-filter-branch by design checks out each and every
commit as it existed in the original repo. If your repo has <strong>10^5</strong> files
and <strong>10^5</strong> commits, but each commit only modifies five files, then
git-filter-branch will make you do <strong>10^10</strong> modifications, despite only
having (at most) <strong>5*10^5</strong> unique blobs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
If you try and cheat and try to make git-filter-branch only work on
files modified in a commit, then two things happen</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
you run into problems with deletions whenever the user is simply trying
to rename files (because attempting to delete files that don&#39;t exist
looks like a no-op; it takes some chicanery to remap deletes across file
renames when the renames happen via arbitrary user-provided shell)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
even if you succeed at the map-deletes-for-renames chicanery, you still
technically violate backward compatibility because users are allowed to
filter files in ways that depend upon topology of commits instead of
filtering solely based on file contents or names (though this has not
been observed in the wild).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Even if you don&#39;t need to edit files but only want to e.g. rename or
remove some and thus can avoid checking out each file (i.e. you can use
–index-filter), you still are passing shell snippets for your filters.
This means that for every commit, you have to have a prepared git repo
where those filters can be run. That&#39;s a significant setup.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Further, several additional files are created or updated per commit by
git-filter-branch. Some of these are for supporting the convenience
functions provided by git-filter-branch (such as map()), while others
are for keeping track of internal state (but could have also been
accessed by user filters; one of git-filter-branch&#39;s regression tests
does so). This essentially amounts to using the filesystem as an IPC
mechanism between git-filter-branch and the user-provided filters. Disks
tend to be a slow IPC mechanism, and writing these files also
effectively represents a forced synchronization point between separate
processes that we hit with every commit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
The user-provided shell commands will likely involve a pipeline of
commands, resulting in the creation of many processes per commit.
Creating and running another process takes a widely varying amount of
time between operating systems, but on any platform it is very slow
relative to invoking a function.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
git-filter-branch itself is written in shell, which is kind of slow.
This is the one performance issue that could be backward-compatibly
fixed, but compared to the above problems that are intrinsic to the
design of git-filter-branch, the language of the tool itself is a
relatively minor issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Side note: Unfortunately, people tend to fixate on the written-in-shell
aspect and periodically ask if git-filter-branch could be rewritten in
another language to fix the performance issues. Not only does that
ignore the bigger intrinsic problems with the design, it&#39;d help less
than you&#39;d expect: if git-filter-branch itself were not shell, then the
convenience functions (map(), skip_commit(), etc) and the <strong>–setup</strong>
argument could no longer be executed once at the beginning of the
program but would instead need to be prepended to every user filter (and
thus re-executed with every commit).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <strong>git filter-repo</strong>[1] tool is an alternative to git-filter-branch
which does not suffer from these performance problems or the safety
problems (mentioned below). For those with existing tooling which relies
upon git-filter-branch, <em>git filter-repo</em> also provides
<strong>filter-lamely</strong>[2], a drop-in git-filter-branch replacement (with a few
caveats). While filter-lamely suffers from all the same safety issues as
git-filter-branch, it at least ameliorates the performance issues a
little.</p>

<p>git-filter-branch is riddled with gotchas resulting in various ways to
easily corrupt repos or end up with a mess worse than what you started
with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Someone can have a set of &#34;working and tested filters&#34; which they
document or provide to a coworker, who then runs them on a different OS
where the same commands are not working/tested (some examples in the
git-filter-branch manpage are also affected by this). BSD vs. GNU
userland differences can really bite. If lucky, error messages are
spewed. But just as likely, the commands either don&#39;t do the filtering
requested, or silently corrupt by making some unwanted change. The
unwanted change may only affect a few commits, so it&#39;s not necessarily
obvious either. (The fact that problems won&#39;t necessarily be obvious
means they are likely to go unnoticed until the rewritten history is in
use for quite a while, at which point it&#39;s really hard to justify
another flag-day for another rewrite.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Filenames with spaces are often mishandled by shell snippets since they
cause problems for shell pipelines. Not everyone is familiar with find
-print0, xargs -0, git-ls-files -z, etc. Even people who are familiar
with these may assume such flags are not relevant because someone else
renamed any such files in their repo back before the person doing the
filtering joined the project. And often, even those familiar with
handling arguments with spaces may not do so just because they aren&#39;t in
the mindset of thinking about everything that could possibly go wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Non-ascii filenames can be silently removed despite being in a desired
directory. Keeping only wanted paths is often done using pipelines like
<strong>git ls-files | grep -v ^WANTED_DIR/ | xargs git rm</strong>. ls-files will only
quote filenames if needed, so folks may not notice that one of the files
didn&#39;t match the regex (at least not until it&#39;s much too late). Yes,
someone who knows about core.quotePath can avoid this (unless they have
other special characters like \t, \n, or &#34;), and people who use ls-files
-z with something other than grep can avoid this, but that doesn&#39;t mean
they will.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Similarly, when moving files around, one can find that filenames with
non-ascii or special characters end up in a different directory, one
that includes a double quote character. (This is technically the same
issue as above with quoting, but perhaps an interesting different way
that it can and has manifested as a problem.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
It&#39;s far too easy to accidentally mix up old and new history. It&#39;s still
possible with any tool, but git-filter-branch almost invites it. If
lucky, the only downside is users getting frustrated that they don&#39;t
know how to shrink their repo and remove the old stuff. If unlucky, they
merge old and new history and end up with multiple &#34;copies&#34; of each
commit, some of which have unwanted or sensitive files and others which
don&#39;t. This comes about in multiple different ways:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
the default to only doing a partial history rewrite (<em>–all</em> is not the
default and few examples show it)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
the fact that there&#39;s no automatic post-run cleanup</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
the fact that –tag-name-filter (when used to rename tags) doesn&#39;t
remove the old tags but just adds new ones with the new name</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
the fact that little educational information is provided to inform users
of the ramifications of a rewrite and how to avoid mixing old and new
history. For example, this man page discusses how users need to
understand that they need to rebase their changes for all their branches
on top of new history (or delete and reclone), but that&#39;s only one of
multiple concerns to consider. See the &#34;DISCUSSION&#34; section of the git
filter-repo manual page for more details.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Annotated tags can be accidentally converted to lightweight tags, due to
either of two issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Someone can do a history rewrite, realize they messed up, restore from
the backups in refs/original/, and then redo their git-filter-branch
command. (The backup in refs/original/ is not a real backup; it
dereferences tags first.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Running git-filter-branch with either –tags or –all in your
&lt;rev-list-options&gt;. In order to retain annotated tags as annotated, you
must use –tag-name-filter (and must not have restored from
refs/original/ in a previously botched rewrite).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Any commit messages that specify an encoding will become corrupted by
the rewrite; git-filter-branch ignores the encoding, takes the original
bytes, and feeds it to commit-tree without telling it the proper
encoding. (This happens whether or not –msg-filter is used.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Commit messages (even if they are all UTF-8) by default become corrupted
due to not being updated — any references to other commit hashes in
commit messages will now refer to no-longer-extant commits.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
There are no facilities for helping users find what unwanted crud they
should delete, which means they are much more likely to have incomplete
or partial cleanups that sometimes result in confusion and people
wasting time trying to understand. (For example, folks tend to just look
for big files to delete instead of big directories or extensions, and
once they do so, then sometime later folks using the new repository who
are going through history will notice a build artifact directory that
has some files but not others, or a cache of dependencies (node_modules
or similar) which couldn&#39;t have ever been functional since it&#39;s missing
some files.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
If –prune-empty isn&#39;t specified, then the filtering process can create
hoards of confusing empty commits</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
If –prune-empty is specified, then intentionally placed empty commits
from before the filtering operation are also pruned instead of just
pruning commits that became empty due to filtering rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
If –prune-empty is specified, sometimes empty commits are missed and
left around anyway (a somewhat rare bug, but it happens…)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
A minor issue, but users who have a goal to update all names and emails
in a repository may be led to –env-filter which will only update
authors and committers, missing taggers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
If the user provides a –tag-name-filter that maps multiple tags to the
same name, no warning or error is provided; git-filter-branch simply
overwrites each tag in some undocumented pre-defined order resulting in
only one tag at the end. (A git-filter-branch regression test requires
this surprising behavior.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Also, the poor performance of git-filter-branch often leads to safety
issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Coming up with the correct shell snippet to do the filtering you want is
sometimes difficult unless you&#39;re just doing a trivial modification such
as deleting a couple files. Unfortunately, people often learn if the
snippet is right or wrong by trying it out, but the rightness or
wrongness can vary depending on special circumstances (spaces in
filenames, non-ascii filenames, funny author names or emails, invalid
timezones, presence of grafts or replace objects, etc.), meaning they
may have to wait a long time, hit an error, then restart. The
performance of git-filter-branch is so bad that this cycle is painful,
reducing the time available to carefully re-check (to say nothing about
what it does to the patience of the person doing the rewrite even if
they do technically have more time available). This problem is extra
compounded because errors from broken filters may not be shown for a
long time and/or get lost in a sea of output. Even worse, broken filters
often just result in silent incorrect rewrites.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
To top it all off, even when users finally find working commands, they
naturally want to share them. But they may be unaware that their repo
didn&#39;t have some special cases that someone else&#39;s does. So, when
someone else with a different repository runs the same commands, they
get hit by the problems above. Or, the user just runs commands that
really were vetted for special cases, but they run it on a different OS
where it doesn&#39;t work, as noted above.</p>
