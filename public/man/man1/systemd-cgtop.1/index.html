SYNOPSIS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>systemd-cgtop</strong> [OPTIONS…] [GROUP]</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="headline-3">
DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>systemd-cgtop</strong> shows the top control groups of the local Linux control
group hierarchy, ordered by their CPU, memory, or disk I/O load. The
display is refreshed in regular intervals (by default every 1s), similar
in style to *top*(1). If a control group path is specified, shows only
the services of the specified control group.</p>
<p>
If <strong>systemd-cgtop</strong> is not connected to a tty, no column headers are
printed and the default is to only run one iteration. The
<strong>–iterations=</strong> argument, if given, is honored. This mode is suitable
for scripting.</p>
<p>
Resource usage is only accounted for control groups with the appropriate
controllers turned on: &#34;cpu&#34; controller for CPU usage, &#34;memory&#34;
controller for memory usage, and &#34;io&#34; controller for disk I/O
consumption. If resource monitoring for these resources is required, it
is recommended to add the <em>CPUAccounting=1</em>, <em>MemoryAccounting=1</em> and
<em>IOAccounting=1</em> settings in the unit files in question. See
*systemd.resource-control*(5) for details.</p>
<p>
The CPU load value can be between 0 and 100 times the number of
processors the system has. For example, if the system has 8 processors,
the CPU load value is going to be between 0% and 800%. The number of
processors can be found in &#34;/proc/cpuinfo&#34;.</p>
<p>
To emphasize: unless &#34;CPUAccounting=1&#34;, &#34;MemoryAccounting=1&#34;, and
&#34;IOAccounting=1&#34; are enabled for the services in question, no resource
accounting will be available for system services and the data shown by
<strong>systemd-cgtop</strong> will be incomplete.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The following options are understood:</p>
<p>
<strong>-p</strong>, <strong>–order=path</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Order by control group path name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-t</strong>, <strong>–order=tasks</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Order by number of tasks/processes in the control group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-c</strong>, <strong>–order=cpu</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Order by CPU load.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-m</strong>, <strong>–order=memory</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Order by memory usage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-i</strong>, <strong>–order=io</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Order by disk I/O load.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-b</strong>, <strong>–batch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run in &#34;batch&#34; mode: do not accept input and run until the iteration
limit set with <strong>–iterations=</strong> is exhausted or until killed. This mode
could be useful for sending output from <strong>systemd-cgtop</strong> to other
programs or to a file.</p>
<p>
Added in version 188.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-r</strong>, <strong>–raw</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Format byte counts (as in memory usage and I/O metrics) and CPU time
with raw numeric values rather than human-readable numbers.</p>
<p>
Added in version 221.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–cpu=percentage</strong>, <strong>–cpu=time</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Controls whether the CPU usage is shown as percentage or time. By
default, the CPU usage is shown as percentage. This setting may also be
toggled at runtime by pressing the % key.</p>
<p>
Added in version 226.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-P</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Count only userspace processes instead of all tasks. By default, all
tasks are counted: each kernel thread and each userspace thread
individually. With this setting, kernel threads are excluded from the
count and each userspace process only counts as one task, regardless of
how many threads it consists of. This setting may also be toggled at
runtime by pressing the P key. This option may not be combined with
<strong>-k</strong>.</p>
<p>
Added in version 227.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-k</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Count only userspace processes and kernel threads instead of all tasks.
By default, all tasks are counted: each kernel thread and each userspace
thread individually. With this setting, kernel threads are included in
the count and each userspace process only counts as one task, regardless
of how many threads it consists of. This setting may also be toggled at
runtime by pressing the k key. This option may not be combined with
<strong>-P</strong>.</p>
<p>
Added in version 226.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–recursive=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Controls whether the number of processes shown for a control group shall
include all processes that are contained in any of the child control
groups as well. Takes a boolean argument, which defaults to &#34;yes&#34;. If
enabled, the processes in child control groups are included, if
disabled, only the processes in the control group itself are counted.
This setting may also be toggled at runtime by pressing the r key. Note
that this setting only applies to process counting, i.e. when the <strong>-P</strong>
or <strong>-k</strong> options are used. It has not effect if all tasks are counted, in
which case the counting is always recursive.</p>
<p>
Added in version 226.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-n</strong>, <strong>–iterations=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perform only this many iterations. A value of 0 indicates that the
program should run indefinitely.</p>
<p>
Added in version 188.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-1</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A shortcut for <strong>–iterations=1</strong>.</p>
<p>
Added in version 238.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-d</strong>, <strong>–delay=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify refresh delay in seconds (or if one of &#34;ms&#34;, &#34;us&#34;, &#34;min&#34; is
specified as unit in this time unit). This setting may also be increased
and decreased at runtime by pressing the + and - keys.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–depth=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maximum control group tree traversal depth. Specifies how deep
<strong>systemd-cgtop</strong> shall traverse the control group hierarchies. If 0 is
specified, only the root group is monitored. For 1, only the first level
of control groups is monitored, and so on. Defaults to 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*-M */MACHINE/, *–machine=*/MACHINE/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit control groups shown to the part corresponding to the container
<em>MACHINE</em>. This option may not be used when a control group path is
specified.</p>
<p>
Added in version 227.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-h</strong>, <strong>–help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short version string and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
