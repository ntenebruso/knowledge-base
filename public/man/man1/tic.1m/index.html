DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The <strong>tic</strong> command translates a <strong>terminfo</strong> file from source format into
compiled format. The compiled format is necessary for use with the
library routines in *ncurses*(3X).</p>
<p>
As described in *term*(5), the database may be either a directory tree
(one file per terminal entry) or a hashed database (one record per
entry). The <strong>tic</strong> command writes only one type of entry, depending on
how it was built:</p>
<ul>
<li>For directory trees, the top-level directory, e.g.,
/usr/share/terminfo, specifies the location of the database.</li>
<li>For hashed databases, a filename is needed. If the given file is not
found by that name, but can be found by adding the suffix &#34;.db&#34;, then
that is used.

The default name for the hashed database is the same as the default
directory name (only adding a &#34;.db&#34; suffix).</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case (directory or hashed database), <strong>tic</strong> will create the
container if it does not exist. For a directory, this would be the
terminfo leaf, versus a &#34;terminfo.db&#34; file.</p>
<p>
The results are normally placed in the system terminfo database
<strong>/nix/store/53iigsmf32bwkfdhhihq2rppgk23k2rg-ncurses-6.4.20221231/share/terminfo</strong>.
The compiled terminal description can be placed in a different terminfo
database. There are two ways to achieve this:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you may override the system default either by using the <strong>-o</strong>
option, or by setting the variable <strong>TERMINFO</strong> in your shell
environment to a valid database location.</li>
<li>Secondly, if <strong>tic</strong> cannot write in
<em>/nix/store/53iigsmf32bwkfdhhihq2rppgk23k2rg-ncurses-6.4.20221231/share/terminfo</em>
or the location specified using your TERMINFO variable, it looks for
the directory <em>$HOME</em>.terminfo/ (or hashed database
<em>$HOME</em>.terminfo.db)/; if that location exists, the entry is placed
there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Libraries that read terminfo entries are expected to check in succession</p>
<ul>
<li>a location specified with the TERMINFO environment variable,</li>
<li><em>$HOME</em>.terminfo/,</li>
<li>directories listed in the TERMINFO_DIRS environment variable,</li>
<li>a compiled-in list of directories (no default value), and</li>
<li>the system terminfo database
(<em>/nix/store/53iigsmf32bwkfdhhihq2rppgk23k2rg-ncurses-6.4.20221231/share/terminfo</em>).</li>

ALIASES
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p>This is the same program as infotocap and captoinfo; usually those are
linked to, or copied from this program:</p>
<ul>
<li>When invoked as infotocap, tic sets the <strong>-I</strong> option.</li>
<li>When invoked as captoinfo, tic sets the <strong>-C</strong> option.</li>
</ul>

OPTIONS
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-0</strong>
</dt>
<dd>restricts the output to a single line</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>restricts the output to a single column</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-a</strong>
</dt>
<dd>tells <strong>tic</strong> to retain commented-out capabilities rather than
discarding them. Capabilities are commented by prefixing them with a
period. This sets the <strong>-x</strong> option, because it treats the commented-out
entries as user-defined names. If the source is termcap, accept the
2-character names required by version 6. Otherwise these are ignored.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-C</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Force source translation to termcap format. Note: this differs
from the <strong>-C</strong> option of *infocmp*(1M) in that it does not merely
translate capability names, but also translates terminfo strings to
termcap format. Capabilities that are not translatable are left in the
entry under their terminfo names but commented out with two preceding
dots. The actual format used incorporates some improvements for
escaped characters from terminfo format. For a stricter BSD-compatible
translation, add the <strong>-K</strong> option.</p>
<p>
If this is combined with <strong>-c</strong>, <strong>tic</strong> makes additional checks to report
cases where the terminfo values do not have an exact equivalent in
termcap form. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>sgr</strong> usually will not convert, because termcap lacks the ability to
work with more than two parameters, and because termcap lacks many
of the arithmetic/logical operators used in terminfo.</li>
<li>capabilities with more than one delay or with delays before the end
of the string will not convert completely.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-c</strong>
</dt>
<dd>tells <strong>tic</strong> to only check <em>file</em> for errors, including syntax
problems and bad use-links. If you specify <strong>-C</strong> (<strong>-I</strong>) with this
option, the code will print warnings about entries which, after use
resolution, are more than 1023 (4096) bytes long. Due to a fixed
buffer length in older termcap libraries, as well as buggy checking
for the buffer length (and a documented limit in terminfo), these
entries may cause core dumps with other implementations.

<strong>tic</strong> checks string capabilities to ensure that those with parameters
will be valid expressions. It does this check only for the predefined
string capabilities; those which are defined with the <strong>-x</strong> option are
ignored.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-D</strong>
</dt>
<dd>tells <strong>tic</strong> to print the database locations that it knows
about, and exit. The first location shown is the one to which it would
write compiled terminal descriptions. If <strong>tic</strong> is not able to find a
writable database location according to the rules summarized above, it
will print a diagnostic and exit with an error rather than printing a
list of database locations.</dd>
<dt>
*-e */names/
</dt>
<dd>Limit writes and translations to the following
comma-separated list of terminals. If any name or alias of a terminal
matches one of the names in the list, the entry will be written or
translated as normal. Otherwise no output will be generated for it.
The option value is interpreted as a file containing the list if it
contains a &#39;/&#39;. (Note: depending on how tic was compiled, this option
may require <strong>-I</strong> or <strong>-C</strong>.)</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-f</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Display complex terminfo strings which contain
if/then/else/endif expressions indented for readability.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-G</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Display constant literals in decimal form rather than their
character equivalents.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-g</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Display constant character literals in quoted form rather than
their decimal equivalents.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-I</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Force source translation to terminfo format.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-K</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Suppress some longstanding ncurses extensions to termcap
format, e.g., &#34;\s&#34; for space.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-L</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Force source translation to terminfo format using the long C
variable names listed in &lt;*term.h*&gt;</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-N</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Disable smart defaults. Normally, when translating from
termcap to terminfo, the compiler makes a number of assumptions about
the defaults of string capabilities <strong>reset1_string</strong>,
<strong>carriage_return</strong>, <strong>cursor_left</strong>, <strong>cursor_down</strong>, <strong>scroll_forward</strong>,
<strong>tab</strong>, <strong>newline</strong>, <strong>key_backspace</strong>, <strong>key_left</strong>, and <strong>key_down</strong>, then
attempts to use obsolete termcap capabilities to deduce correct
values. It also normally suppresses output of obsolete termcap
capabilities such as <strong>bs</strong>. This option forces a more literal
translation that also preserves the obsolete capabilities.</dd>
<dt>
*-o*/dir/
</dt>
<dd>Write compiled entries to given database location.
Overrides the TERMINFO environment variable.</dd>
<dt>
*-Q*/n/
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Rather than show source in terminfo (text) format, print
the compiled (binary) format in hexadecimal or base64 form, depending
on the option&#39;s value:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
1
</dt>
<dd>hexadecimal</dd>
<dt>
2
</dt>
<dd>base64</dd>
<dt>
3
</dt>
<dd>hexadecimal and base64</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-q</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Suppress comments and blank lines when showing translated
source.</dd>
<dt>
*-R*/subset/
</dt>
<dd>Restrict output to a given subset. This option is for
use with archaic versions of terminfo like those on SVr1, Ultrix, or
HP-UX that do not support the full set of SVR4/XSI Curses terminfo;
and outright broken ports like AIX 3.x that have their own extensions
incompatible with SVr4/XSI. Available subsets are SVr1, Ultrix, HP,
BSD and AIX; see *terminfo*(5) for details.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-r</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Force entry resolution (so there are no remaining tc
capabilities) even when doing translation to termcap format. This may
be needed if you are preparing a termcap file for a termcap library
(such as GNU termcap through version 1.3 or BSD termcap through
4.3BSD) that does not handle multiple tc capabilities per entry.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-s</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Summarize the compile by showing the database location into
which entries are written, and the number of entries which are
compiled.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-T</strong>
</dt>
<dd>eliminates size-restrictions on the generated text. This is
mainly useful for testing and analysis, since the compiled
descriptions are limited (e.g., 1023 for termcap, 4096 for terminfo).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-t</strong>
</dt>
<dd>tells <strong>tic</strong> to discard commented-out capabilities. Normally
when translating from terminfo to termcap, untranslatable capabilities
are commented-out.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-U</strong>
</dt>
<dd>tells <strong>tic</strong> to not post-process the data after parsing the
source file. Normally, it infers data which is commonly missing in
older terminfo data, or in termcaps.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-V</strong>
</dt>
<dd>reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program,
and exits.</dd>
<dt>
*-v*/n/
</dt>
<dd>
<p>specifies that (verbose) output be written to standard
error trace information showing <strong>tic</strong>&#39;s progress.</p>
<p>
The optional parameter <em>n</em> is a number from 1 to 9, inclusive,
indicating the desired level of detail of information.</p>
<ul>
<li>If ncurses is built without tracing support, the optional parameter
is ignored.</li>
<li>If <em>n</em> is omitted, the default level is 1.</li>
<li>If <em>n</em> is specified and greater than 1, the level of detail is
increased, and the output is written (with tracing information) to
the trace file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The debug flag levels are as follows:</p>
<dl>

1

<dd>Names of files created and linked</dd>
<dt>
2
</dt>
<dd>Information related to the use facility</dd>

<dt>
9
</dt>
<dd>All values computed in construction of the hash table</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-W</strong>
</dt>
<dd>By itself, the <strong>-w</strong> option will not force long strings to be
wrapped. Use the <strong>-W</strong> option to do this.

If you specify both <strong>-f</strong> and <strong>-W</strong> options, the latter is ignored when
<strong>-f</strong> has already split the line.</dd>
<dt>
*-w*/n/
</dt>
<dd>specifies the width of the output. The parameter is
optional. If it is omitted, it defaults to 60.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-x</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Treat unknown capabilities as user-defined (see
<strong>user_caps(5)</strong>). That is, if you supply a capability name which <strong>tic</strong>
does not recognize, it will infer its type (boolean, number or string)
from the syntax and make an extended table entry for that.
User-defined capability strings whose name begins with k are treated
as function keys.</dd>

HISTORY
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>System V Release 2 provided a <strong>tic</strong> utility. It accepted a single
option: <strong>-v</strong> (optionally followed by a number). According to Ross
Ridge&#39;s comment in <em>mytinfo</em>, this version of <strong>tic</strong> was unable to
represent cancelled capabilities.</p>
<p>
System V Release 3 provided a different <strong>tic</strong> utility, written by Pavel
Curtis, (originally named compile in <em>pcurses</em>). This added an option
<strong>-c</strong> to check the file for errors, with the caveat that errors in use=
links would not be reported. System V Release 3 documented a few warning
messages which did not appear in <em>pcurses</em>. While the program itself was
changed little as development continued with System V Release 4, the
table of capabilities grew from 180 (<em>pcurses</em>) to 464 (Solaris).</p>
<p>
In early development of ncurses (1993), Zeyd Ben-Halim used the table
from <em>mytinfo</em> to extend the <em>pcurses</em> table to 469 capabilities (456
matched SVr4, 8 were only in SVr4, 13 were not in SVr4). Of those 13, 11
were ultimately discarded (perhaps to match the draft of X/Open Curses).
The exceptions were <strong>memory_lock_above</strong> and <strong>memory_unlock</strong> (see
*user_caps*(5)).</p>
<p>
Eric Raymond incorporated parts of <em>mytinfo</em> into ncurses to implement
the termcap-to-terminfo source conversion, and extended that to begin
development of the corresponding terminfo-to-termcap source conversion,
Thomas Dickey completed that development over the course of several
years.</p>
<p>
In 1999, Thomas Dickey added the <strong>-x</strong> option to support user-defined
capabilities.</p>
<p>
In 2010, Roy Marples provided a <strong>tic</strong> program and terminfo library for
NetBSD. That implementation adapts several features from ncurses,
including <strong>tic</strong>&#39;s <strong>-x</strong> option.</p>
<p>
The <strong>-c</strong> option tells <strong>tic</strong> to check for problems in the terminfo source
file. Continued development provides additional checks:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>pcurses</em> had 8 warnings</li>
<li>ncurses in 1996 had 16 warnings</li>
<li>Solaris (SVr4) curses has 28 warnings</li>
<li>NetBSD tic in 2019 has 19 warnings.</li>
<li>ncurses in 2019 has 96 warnings</li>
</ul>
<p>The checking done in ncurses&#39; <strong>tic</strong> helps with the conversion to
termcap, as well as pointing out errors and inconsistencies. It is also
used to ensure consistency with the user-defined capabilities. There are
527 distinct capabilities in ncurses&#39; terminal database; 128 of those
are user-defined.</p>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-9">
PORTABILITY
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p>X/Open Curses, Issue 7 (2009) provides a brief description of <strong>tic</strong>. It
lists one option: <strong>-c</strong>. The omission of <strong>-v</strong> is unexpected. The change
history states that the description is derived from True64 UNIX.
According to its manual pages, that system also supported the <strong>-v</strong>
option.</p>
<p>
Shortly after Issue 7 was released, Tru64 was discontinued. As of 2019,
the surviving implementations of <strong>tic</strong> are SVr4 (AIX, HP-UX and
Solaris), ncurses and NetBSD curses. The SVr4 <strong>tic</strong> programs all support
the <strong>-v</strong> option. The NetBSD <strong>tic</strong> program follows X/Open&#39;s
documentation, omitting the <strong>-v</strong> option.</p>
<p>
The X/Open rationale states that some implementations of <strong>tic</strong> read
terminal descriptions from the standard input if the <em>file</em> parameter is
omitted. None of these implementations do that. Further, it comments
that some may choose to read from ./terminfo.src but that is obsolescent
behavior from SVr2, and is not (for example) a documented feature of
SVr3.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-10" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-10">
COMPATIBILITY
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-3">
<p>There is some evidence that historic <strong>tic</strong> implementations treated
description fields with no whitespace in them as additional aliases or
short names. This <strong>tic</strong> does not do that, but it does warn when
description fields may be treated that way and check them for dangerous
characters.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-11" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-11">
EXTENSIONS
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Unlike the SVr4 <strong>tic</strong> command, this implementation can actually compile
termcap sources. In fact, entries in terminfo and termcap syntax can be
mixed in a single source file. See *terminfo*(5) for the list of termcap
names taken to be equivalent to terminfo names.</p>
<p>
The SVr4 manual pages are not clear on the resolution rules for <strong>use</strong>
capabilities. This implementation of <strong>tic</strong> will find <strong>use</strong> targets
anywhere in the source file, or anywhere in the file tree rooted at
<strong>TERMINFO</strong> (if <strong>TERMINFO</strong> is defined), or in the user&#39;s
<em>$HOME</em>.terminfo/ database (if it exists), or (finally) anywhere in the
system&#39;s file tree of compiled entries.</p>
<p>
The error messages from this <strong>tic</strong> have the same format as GNU C error
messages, and can be parsed by GNU Emacs&#39;s compile facility.</p>
<p>
Aside from <strong>-c</strong> and <strong>-v</strong>, options are not portable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of tic&#39;s options are not supported by SVr4 <strong>tic</strong>:

<strong>-0</strong> <strong>-1</strong> <strong>-C</strong> <strong>-G</strong> <strong>-I</strong> <strong>-N</strong> <strong>-R</strong> <strong>-T</strong> <strong>-V</strong> <strong>-a</strong> <strong>-e</strong> <strong>-f</strong> <strong>-g</strong> <strong>-o</strong>
<strong>-r</strong> <strong>-s</strong> <strong>-t</strong> <strong>-x</strong></li>
<li>The NetBSD <strong>tic</strong> supports a few of the ncurses options

<strong>-a</strong> <strong>-o</strong> <strong>-x</strong>

and adds <strong>-S</strong> (a feature which does the same thing as infocmp&#39;s <strong>-e</strong>
and <strong>-E</strong> options).</li>
</ul>
<p>The SVr4 <strong>-c</strong> mode does not report bad use= links.</p>
<p>
System V does not compile entries to or read entries from your
<em>$HOME</em>.terminfo/ database unless TERMINFO is explicitly set to it.</p>
