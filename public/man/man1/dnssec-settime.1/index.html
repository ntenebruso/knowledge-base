DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>dnssec-settime</strong> reads a DNSSEC private key file and sets the key timing
metadata as specified by the <em>-P</em>, <em>-A</em>, <em>-R</em>, <em>-I</em>, and <em>-D</em> options.
The metadata can then be used by <em>dnssec-signzone</em> or other signing
software to determine when a key is to be published, whether it should
be used for signing a zone, etc.</p>
<p>
If none of these options is set on the command line, <strong>dnssec-settime</strong>
simply prints the key timing metadata already stored in the key.</p>
<p>
When key metadata fields are changed, both files of a key pair
(<strong>Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key</strong> and <strong>Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private</strong>) are regenerated.</p>
<p>
Metadata fields are stored in the private file. A human-readable
description of the metadata is also placed in comments in the key file.
The private file&#39;s permissions are always set to be inaccessible to
anyone other than the owner (mode 0600).</p>
<p>
When working with state files, it is possible to update the timing
metadata in those files as well with <em>-s</em>. With this option, it is also
possible to update key states with <em>-d</em> (DS), <em>-k</em> (DNSKEY), <em>-r</em> (RRSIG
of KSK), or <em>-z</em> (RRSIG of ZSK). Allowed states are HIDDEN, RUMOURED,
OMNIPRESENT, and UNRETENTIVE.</p>
<p>
The goal state of the key can also be set with <em>-g</em>. This should be
either HIDDEN or OMNIPRESENT, representing whether the key should be
removed from the zone or published.</p>
<p>
It is NOT RECOMMENDED to manipulate state files manually, except for
testing purposes.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-f</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option forces an update of an old-format key with no
metadata fields. Without this option, <strong>dnssec-settime</strong> fails when
attempting to update a legacy key. With this option, the key is
recreated in the new format, but with the original key data retained.
The key&#39;s creation date is set to the present time. If no other values
are specified, then the key&#39;s publication and activation dates are
also set to the present time.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-K directory</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the directory in which the key
files are to reside.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-L ttl</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the default TTL to use for this key when
it is converted into a DNSKEY RR. This is the TTL used when the key is
imported into a zone, unless there was already a DNSKEY RRset in
place, in which case the existing TTL takes precedence. If this value
is not set and there is no existing DNSKEY RRset, the TTL defaults to
the SOA TTL. Setting the default TTL to <strong>0</strong> or <strong>none</strong> removes it from
the key.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-h</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option emits a usage message and exits.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-V</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option prints version information.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-v level</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the debugging level.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-E engine</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option specifies the cryptographic hardware to
use, when applicable.

When BIND 9 is built with OpenSSL, this needs to be set to the OpenSSL
engine identifier that drives the cryptographic accelerator or
hardware service module (usually <strong>pkcs11</strong>).</dd>
</dl>

TIMING OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS (which
is the format used inside key files), or &#39;Day Mon DD HH:MM:SS YYYY&#39; (as
printed by <strong>dnssec-settime -p</strong>), or UNIX epoch time (as printed by
<strong>dnssec-settime -up</strong>), or the literal <strong>now</strong>.</p>
<p>
The argument can be followed by <strong>+</strong> or <strong>-</strong> and an offset from the given
time. The literal <strong>now</strong> can be omitted before an offset. The offset can
be followed by one of the suffixes <strong>y</strong>, <strong>mo</strong>, <strong>w</strong>, <strong>d</strong>, <strong>h</strong>, or <strong>mi</strong>, so
that it is computed in years (defined as 365 24-hour days, ignoring leap
years), months (defined as 30 24-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or
minutes, respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is computed in
seconds.</p>
<p>
To unset a date, use <strong>none</strong>, <strong>never</strong>, or <strong>unset</strong>.</p>
<p>
All these formats are case-insensitive.</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-P date/offset</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option sets the date on which a key is to be
published to the zone. After that date, the key is included in the
zone but is not used to sign it.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>ds date/offset</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the date on which DS records
that match this key have been seen in the parent zone.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>sync date/offset</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the date on which CDS and
CDNSKEY records that match this key are to be published to the zone.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-A date/offset</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the date on which the key is to
be activated. After that date, the key is included in the zone and
used to sign it.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-R date/offset</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the date on which the key is to
be revoked. After that date, the key is flagged as revoked. It is
included in the zone and is used to sign it.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-I date/offset</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the date on which the key is to
be retired. After that date, the key is still included in the zone,
but it is not used to sign it.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-D date/offset</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option sets the date on which the key is to
be deleted. After that date, the key is no longer included in the
zone. (However, it may remain in the key repository.)</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>ds date/offset</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the date on which the DS
records that match this key have been seen removed from the parent
zone.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>sync date/offset</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the date on which the CDS and
CDNSKEY records that match this key are to be deleted.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-S predecessor key</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option selects a key for which the key
being modified is an explicit successor. The name, algorithm, size,
and type of the predecessor key must exactly match those of the key
being modified. The activation date of the successor key is set to the
inactivation date of the predecessor. The publication date is set to
the activation date minus the prepublication interval, which defaults
to 30 days.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-i interval</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the prepublication interval for a
key. If set, then the publication and activation dates must be
separated by at least this much time. If the activation date is
specified but the publication date is not, the publication date
defaults to this much time before the activation date; conversely, if
the publication date is specified but not the activation date,
activation is set to this much time after publication.

If the key is being created as an explicit successor to another key,
then the default prepublication interval is 30 days; otherwise it is
zero.

As with date offsets, if the argument is followed by one of the
suffixes <strong>y</strong>, <strong>mo</strong>, <strong>w</strong>, <strong>d</strong>, <strong>h</strong>, or <strong>mi</strong>, the interval is measured
in years, months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, respectively.
Without a suffix, the interval is measured in seconds.</dd>
