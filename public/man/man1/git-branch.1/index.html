DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>If <strong>–list</strong> is given, or if there are no non-option arguments, existing
branches are listed; the current branch will be highlighted in green and
marked with an asterisk. Any branches checked out in linked worktrees
will be highlighted in cyan and marked with a plus sign. Option <strong>-r</strong>
causes the remote-tracking branches to be listed, and option <strong>-a</strong> shows
both local and remote branches.</p>
<p>
If a <strong>&lt;pattern&gt;</strong> is given, it is used as a shell wildcard to restrict
the output to matching branches. If multiple patterns are given, a
branch is shown if it matches any of the patterns.</p>
<p>
Note that when providing a <strong>&lt;pattern&gt;</strong>, you must use <strong>–list</strong>; otherwise
the command may be interpreted as branch creation.</p>
<p>
With <strong>–contains</strong>, shows only the branches that contain the named commit
(in other words, the branches whose tip commits are descendants of the
named commit), <strong>–no-contains</strong> inverts it. With <strong>–merged</strong>, only
branches merged into the named commit (i.e. the branches whose tip
commits are reachable from the named commit) will be listed. With
<strong>–no-merged</strong> only branches not merged into the named commit will be
listed. If the &lt;commit&gt; argument is missing it defaults to <strong>HEAD</strong> (i.e.
the tip of the current branch).</p>
<p>
The command&#39;s second form creates a new branch head named &lt;branchname&gt;
which points to the current <strong>HEAD</strong>, or &lt;start-point&gt; if given. As a
special case, for &lt;start-point&gt;, you may use <strong>&#34;A…B&#34;</strong> as a shortcut for
the merge base of <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> if there is exactly one merge base. You
can leave out at most one of <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, in which case it defaults to
<strong>HEAD</strong>.</p>
<p>
Note that this will create the new branch, but it will not switch the
working tree to it; use &#34;git switch &lt;newbranch&gt;&#34; to switch to the new
branch.</p>
<p>
When a local branch is started off a remote-tracking branch, Git sets up
the branch (specifically the <strong>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</strong> and
<strong>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</strong> configuration entries) so that <em>git pull</em> will
appropriately merge from the remote-tracking branch. This behavior may
be changed via the global <strong>branch.autoSetupMerge</strong> configuration flag.
That setting can be overridden by using the <strong>–track</strong> and <strong>–no-track</strong>
options, and changed later using <strong>git branch –set-upstream-to</strong>.</p>
<p>
With a <strong>-m</strong> or <strong>-M</strong> option, &lt;oldbranch&gt; will be renamed to &lt;newbranch&gt;.
If &lt;oldbranch&gt; had a corresponding reflog, it is renamed to match
&lt;newbranch&gt;, and a reflog entry is created to remember the branch
renaming. If &lt;newbranch&gt; exists, -M must be used to force the rename to
happen.</p>
<p>
The <strong>-c</strong> and <strong>-C</strong> options have the exact same semantics as <strong>-m</strong> and
<strong>-M</strong>, except instead of the branch being renamed, it will be copied to a
new name, along with its config and reflog.</p>
<p>
With a <strong>-d</strong> or <strong>-D</strong> option, <strong>&lt;branchname&gt;</strong> will be deleted. You may
specify more than one branch for deletion. If the branch currently has a
reflog then the reflog will also be deleted.</p>
<p>
Use <strong>-r</strong> together with <strong>-d</strong> to delete remote-tracking branches. Note,
that it only makes sense to delete remote-tracking branches if they no
longer exist in the remote repository or if <em>git fetch</em> was configured
not to fetch them again. See also the <em>prune</em> subcommand of
*git-remote*(1) for a way to clean up all obsolete remote-tracking
branches.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>-d, –delete</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Delete a branch. The branch must be fully merged in its upstream branch,
or in <strong>HEAD</strong> if no upstream was set with <strong>–track</strong> or
<strong>–set-upstream-to</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-D</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shortcut for <strong>–delete –force</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–create-reflog</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create the branch&#39;s reflog. This activates recording of all changes made
to the branch ref, enabling use of date based sha1 expressions such as
&#34;&lt;branchname&gt;@{yesterday}&#34;. Note that in non-bare repositories, reflogs
are usually enabled by default by the <strong>core.logAllRefUpdates</strong> config
option. The negated form <strong>–no-create-reflog</strong> only overrides an earlier
<strong>–create-reflog</strong>, but currently does not negate the setting of
<strong>core.logAllRefUpdates</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-f, –force</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reset &lt;branchname&gt; to &lt;start-point&gt;, even if &lt;branchname&gt; exists
already. Without <strong>-f</strong>, <em>git branch</em> refuses to change an existing
branch. In combination with <strong>-d</strong> (or <strong>–delete</strong>), allow deleting the
branch irrespective of its merged status, or whether it even points to a
valid commit. In combination with <strong>-m</strong> (or <strong>–move</strong>), allow renaming the
branch even if the new branch name already exists, the same applies for
<strong>-c</strong> (or <strong>–copy</strong>).</p>
<p>
Note that <em>git branch -f &lt;branchname&gt; [&lt;start-point&gt;]</em>, even with <em>-f</em>,
refuses to change an existing branch <strong>&lt;branchname&gt;</strong> that is checked out
in another worktree linked to the same repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-m, –move</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Move/rename a branch, together with its config and reflog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-M</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shortcut for <strong>–move –force</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-c, –copy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Copy a branch, together with its config and reflog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-C</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shortcut for <strong>–copy –force</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–color[=&lt;when&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Color branches to highlight current, local, and remote-tracking
branches. The value must be always (the default), never, or auto.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-color</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn off branch colors, even when the configuration file gives the
default to color output. Same as <strong>–color=never</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-i, –ignore-case</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sorting and filtering branches are case insensitive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–omit-empty</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not print a newline after formatted refs where the format expands to
the empty string.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–column[=&lt;options&gt;], –no-column</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Display branch listing in columns. See configuration variable
<strong>column.branch</strong> for option syntax. <strong>–column</strong> and <strong>–no-column</strong> without
options are equivalent to <em>always</em> and <em>never</em> respectively.</p>
<p>
This option is only applicable in non-verbose mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-r, –remotes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>List or delete (if used with -d) the remote-tracking branches. Combine
with <strong>–list</strong> to match the optional pattern(s).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-a, –all</p>
<blockquote>
<p>List both remote-tracking branches and local branches. Combine with
<strong>–list</strong> to match optional pattern(s).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-l, –list</p>
<blockquote>
<p>List branches. With optional <strong>&lt;pattern&gt;…</strong>, e.g. <strong>git branch –list
maint-*</strong>, list only the branches that match the pattern(s).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–show-current</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print the name of the current branch. In detached HEAD state, nothing is
printed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-v, -vv, –verbose</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When in list mode, show sha1 and commit subject line for each head,
along with relationship to upstream branch (if any). If given twice,
print the path of the linked worktree (if any) and the name of the
upstream branch, as well (see also <strong>git remote show &lt;remote&gt;</strong>). Note
that the current worktree&#39;s HEAD will not have its path printed (it will
always be your current directory).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-q, –quiet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be more quiet when creating or deleting a branch, suppressing non-error
messages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–abbrev=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the verbose listing that show the commit object name, show the
shortest prefix that is at least <em>&lt;n&gt;</em> hexdigits long that uniquely
refers the object. The default value is 7 and can be overridden by the
<strong>core.abbrev</strong> config option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-abbrev</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Display the full sha1s in the output listing rather than abbreviating
them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-t, –track[=(direct|inherit)]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When creating a new branch, set up <strong>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</strong> and
<strong>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</strong> configuration entries to set &#34;upstream&#34; tracking
configuration for the new branch. This configuration will tell git to
show the relationship between the two branches in <strong>git status</strong> and <strong>git
branch -v</strong>. Furthermore, it directs <strong>git pull</strong> without arguments to pull
from the upstream when the new branch is checked out.</p>
<p>
The exact upstream branch is chosen depending on the optional argument:
<strong>-t</strong>, <strong>–track</strong>, or <strong>–track=direct</strong> means to use the start-point branch
itself as the upstream; <strong>–track=inherit</strong> means to copy the upstream
configuration of the start-point branch.</p>
<p>
The branch.autoSetupMerge configuration variable specifies how <strong>git
switch</strong>, <strong>git checkout</strong> and <strong>git branch</strong> should behave when neither
<strong>–track</strong> nor <strong>–no-track</strong> are specified:</p>
<p>
The default option, <strong>true</strong>, behaves as though <strong>–track=direct</strong> were
given whenever the start-point is a remote-tracking branch. <strong>false</strong>
behaves as if <strong>–no-track</strong> were given. <strong>always</strong> behaves as though
<strong>–track=direct</strong> were given. <strong>inherit</strong> behaves as though
<strong>–track=inherit</strong> were given. <strong>simple</strong> behaves as though
<strong>–track=direct</strong> were given only when the start-point is a
remote-tracking branch and the new branch has the same name as the
remote branch.</p>
<p>
See <strong>git-pull*(1) and *git-config*(1) for additional discussion on how
the *branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</strong> and <strong>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</strong> options are used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-track</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not set up &#34;upstream&#34; configuration, even if the
branch.autoSetupMerge configuration variable is set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–recurse-submodules</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL! Causes the current command to recurse into
submodules if <strong>submodule.propagateBranches</strong> is enabled. See
<strong>submodule.propagateBranches</strong> in *git-config*(1). Currently, only branch
creation is supported.</p>
<p>
When used in branch creation, a new branch &lt;branchname&gt; will be created
in the superproject and all of the submodules in the superproject&#39;s
&lt;start-point&gt;. In submodules, the branch will point to the submodule
commit in the superproject&#39;s &lt;start-point&gt; but the branch&#39;s tracking
information will be set up based on the submodule&#39;s branches and remotes
e.g. <strong>git branch –recurse-submodules topic origin/main</strong> will create the
submodule branch &#34;topic&#34; that points to the submodule commit in the
superproject&#39;s &#34;origin/main&#34;, but tracks the submodule&#39;s &#34;origin/main&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–set-upstream</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As this option had confusing syntax, it is no longer supported. Please
use <strong>–track</strong> or <strong>–set-upstream-to</strong> instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-u &lt;upstream&gt;, –set-upstream-to=&lt;upstream&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set up &lt;branchname&gt;s tracking information so &lt;upstream&gt; is considered
&lt;branchname&gt;s upstream branch. If no &lt;branchname&gt; is specified, then it
defaults to the current branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–unset-upstream</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remove the upstream information for &lt;branchname&gt;. If no branch is
specified it defaults to the current branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–edit-description</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open an editor and edit the text to explain what the branch is for, to
be used by various other commands (e.g. <strong>format-patch</strong>, <strong>request-pull</strong>,
and <strong>merge</strong> (if enabled)). Multi-line explanations may be used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–contains [&lt;commit&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only list branches which contain the specified commit (HEAD if not
specified). Implies <strong>–list</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-contains [&lt;commit&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only list branches which don&#39;t contain the specified commit (HEAD if not
specified). Implies <strong>–list</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–merged [&lt;commit&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only list branches whose tips are reachable from the specified commit
(HEAD if not specified). Implies <strong>–list</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-merged [&lt;commit&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only list branches whose tips are not reachable from the specified
commit (HEAD if not specified). Implies <strong>–list</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;branchname&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The name of the branch to create or delete. The new branch name must
pass all checks defined by *git-check-ref-format*(1). Some of these
checks may restrict the characters allowed in a branch name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;start-point&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new branch head will point to this commit. It may be given as a
branch name, a commit-id, or a tag. If this option is omitted, the
current HEAD will be used instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;oldbranch&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The name of an existing branch. If this option is omitted, the name of
the current branch will be used instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;newbranch&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new name for an existing branch. The same restrictions as for
&lt;branchname&gt; apply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–sort=&lt;key&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sort based on the key given. Prefix <strong>-</strong> to sort in descending order of
the value. You may use the –sort=&lt;key&gt; option multiple times, in which
case the last key becomes the primary key. The keys supported are the
same as those in <strong>git for-each-ref</strong>. Sort order defaults to the value
configured for the <strong>branch.sort</strong> variable if it exists, or to sorting
based on the full refname (including <strong>refs/…</strong> prefix). This lists
detached HEAD (if present) first, then local branches and finally
remote-tracking branches. See *git-config*(1).</p>

<p>
–points-at &lt;object&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only list branches of the given object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–format &lt;format&gt;</p>

<p>A string that interpolates <strong>%(fieldname)</strong> from a branch ref being shown
and the object it points at. The format is the same as that of
*git-for-each-ref*(1).</p>

CONFIGURATION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>pager.branch</strong> is only respected when listing branches, i.e., when
<strong>–list</strong> is used or implied. The default is to use a pager. See
*git-config*(1).</p>
<p>
Everything above this line in this section isn&#39;t included from the
*git-config*(1) documentation. The content that follows is the same as
what&#39;s found there:</p>
<p>
branch.autoSetupMerge</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tells <em>git branch</em>, <em>git switch</em> and <em>git checkout</em> to set up new
branches so that *git-pull*(1) will appropriately merge from the
starting point branch. Note that even if this option is not set, this
behavior can be chosen per-branch using the <strong>–track</strong> and <strong>–no-track</strong>
options. The valid settings are: <strong>false</strong> — no automatic setup is done;
<strong>true</strong> — automatic setup is done when the starting point is a
remote-tracking branch; <strong>always</strong> — automatic setup is done when the
starting point is either a local branch or remote-tracking branch;
<strong>inherit</strong> — if the starting point has a tracking configuration, it is
copied to the new branch; <strong>simple</strong> — automatic setup is done only when
the starting point is a remote-tracking branch and the new branch has
the same name as the remote branch. This option defaults to true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
branch.autoSetupRebase</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a new branch is created with <em>git branch</em>, <em>git switch</em> or <em>git
checkout</em> that tracks another branch, this variable tells Git to set up
pull to rebase instead of merge (see &#34;branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase&#34;). When
<strong>never</strong>, rebase is never automatically set to true. When <strong>local</strong>, rebase
is set to true for tracked branches of other local branches. When
<strong>remote</strong>, rebase is set to true for tracked branches of remote-tracking
branches. When <strong>always</strong>, rebase will be set to true for all tracking
branches. See &#34;branch.autoSetupMerge&#34; for details on how to set up a
branch to track another branch. This option defaults to never.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
branch.sort</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This variable controls the sort ordering of branches when displayed by
*git-branch*(1). Without the &#34;–sort=&lt;value&gt;&#34; option provided, the value
of this variable will be used as the default. See *git-for-each-ref*(1)
field names for valid values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When on branch &lt;name&gt;, it tells <em>git fetch</em> and <em>git push</em> which remote
to fetch from or push to. The remote to push to may be overridden with
<strong>remote.pushDefault</strong> (for all branches). The remote to push to, for the
current branch, may be further overridden by <strong>branch.&lt;name&gt;.pushRemote</strong>.
If no remote is configured, or if you are not on any branch and there is
more than one remote defined in the repository, it defaults to <strong>origin</strong>
for fetching and <strong>remote.pushDefault</strong> for pushing. Additionally, <strong>.</strong> (a
period) is the current local repository (a dot-repository), see
*branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge*s final note below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
branch.&lt;name&gt;.pushRemote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When on branch &lt;name&gt;, it overrides <strong>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</strong> for pushing.
It also overrides <strong>remote.pushDefault</strong> for pushing from branch &lt;name&gt;.
When you pull from one place (e.g. your upstream) and push to another
place (e.g. your own publishing repository), you would want to set
<strong>remote.pushDefault</strong> to specify the remote to push to for all branches,
and use this option to override it for a specific branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defines, together with branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote, the upstream branch for the
given branch. It tells <em>git fetch///git pull///git rebase</em> which branch
to merge and can also affect <em>git push</em> (see push.default). When in
branch &lt;name&gt;, it tells <em>git fetch</em> the default refspec to be marked for
merging in FETCH_HEAD. The value is handled like the remote part of a
refspec, and must match a ref which is fetched from the remote given by
&#34;branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote&#34;. The merge information is used by <em>git pull</em>
(which first calls <em>git fetch</em>) to lookup the default branch for
merging. Without this option, <em>git pull</em> defaults to merge the first
refspec fetched. Specify multiple values to get an octopus merge. If you
wish to setup <em>git pull</em> so that it merges into &lt;name&gt; from another
branch in the local repository, you can point branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge to the
desired branch, and use the relative path setting <strong>.</strong> (a period) for
branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
branch.&lt;name&gt;.mergeOptions</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets default options for merging into branch &lt;name&gt;. The syntax and
supported options are the same as those of *git-merge*(1), but option
values containing whitespace characters are currently not supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When true, rebase the branch &lt;name&gt; on top of the fetched branch,
instead of merging the default branch from the default remote when &#34;git
pull&#34; is run. See &#34;pull.rebase&#34; for doing this in a non branch-specific
manner.</p>
<p>
When <strong>merges</strong> (or just <em>m</em>), pass the <strong>–rebase-merges</strong> option to <em>git
rebase</em> so that the local merge commits are included in the rebase (see
*git-rebase*(1) for details).</p>
<p>
When the value is <strong>interactive</strong> (or just <em>i</em>), the rebase is run in
interactive mode.</p>
<p>
<strong>NOTE</strong>: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do <strong>not</strong> use it unless
you understand the implications (see *git-rebase*(1) for details).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
branch.&lt;name&gt;.description</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Branch description, can be edited with <strong>git branch –edit-description</strong>.
Branch description is automatically added to the format-patch cover
letter or request-pull summary.</p>

NOTES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>If you are creating a branch that you want to switch to immediately, it
is easier to use the &#34;git switch&#34; command with its <strong>-c</strong> option to do the
same thing with a single command.</p>
<p>
The options <strong>–contains</strong>, <strong>–no-contains</strong>, <strong>–merged</strong> and <strong>–no-merged</strong>
serve four related but different purposes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>–contains &lt;commit&gt;</strong> is used to find all branches which will need
special attention if &lt;commit&gt; were to be rebased or amended, since those
branches contain the specified &lt;commit&gt;.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>–no-contains &lt;commit&gt;</strong> is the inverse of that, i.e. branches that
don&#39;t contain the specified &lt;commit&gt;.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>–merged</strong> is used to find all branches which can be safely deleted,
since those branches are fully contained by HEAD.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>–no-merged</strong> is used to find branches which are candidates for merging
into HEAD, since those branches are not fully contained by HEAD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
When combining multiple <strong>–contains</strong> and <strong>–no-contains</strong> filters, only
references that contain at least one of the <strong>–contains</strong> commits and
contain none of the <strong>–no-contains</strong> commits are shown.</p>
<p>
When combining multiple <strong>–merged</strong> and <strong>–no-merged</strong> filters, only
references that are reachable from at least one of the <strong>–merged</strong>
commits and from none of the <strong>–no-merged</strong> commits are shown.</p>
