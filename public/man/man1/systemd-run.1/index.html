DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>systemd-run</strong> may be used to create and start a transient .service or
.scope unit and run the specified <em>COMMAND</em> in it. It may also be used
to create and start a transient .path, .socket, or .timer unit, that
activates a .service unit when elapsing.</p>
<p>
If a command is run as transient service unit, it will be started and
managed by the service manager like any other service, and thus shows up
in the output of <strong>systemctl list-units</strong> like any other unit. It will run
in a clean and detached execution environment, with the service manager
as its parent process. In this mode, <strong>systemd-run</strong> will start the
service asynchronously in the background and return after the command
has begun execution (unless <strong>–no-block</strong>, <strong>–wait</strong>, <strong>–pipe</strong>, or <strong>–pty</strong>
are specified, see below).</p>
<p>
If a command is run as transient scope unit, it will be executed by
<strong>systemd-run</strong> itself as parent process and will thus inherit the
execution environment of the caller. However, the processes of the
command are managed by the service manager similarly to normal services,
and will show up in the output of <strong>systemctl list-units</strong>. Execution in
this case is synchronous, and will return only when the command
finishes. This mode is enabled via the <strong>–scope</strong> switch (see below).</p>
<p>
If a command is run with path, socket, or timer options such as
<strong>–on-calendar=</strong> (see below), a transient path, socket, or timer unit is
created alongside the service unit for the specified command. Only the
transient path, socket, or timer unit is started immediately, the
transient service unit will be triggered by the path, socket, or timer
unit. If the <strong>–unit=</strong> option is specified, the <em>COMMAND</em> may be
omitted. In this case, <strong>systemd-run</strong> creates only a .path, .socket, or
.timer unit that triggers the specified unit.</p>
<p>
By default, services created with <strong>systemd-run</strong> default to the <strong>simple</strong>
type, see the description of <em>Type=</em> in *systemd.service*(5) for
details. Note that when this type is used, the service manager (and thus
the <strong>systemd-run</strong> command) considers service start-up successful as soon
as the <strong>fork()</strong> for the main service process succeeded, i.e. before the
<strong>execve()</strong> is invoked, and thus even if the specified command cannot be
started. Consider using the <strong>exec</strong> service type (i.e.
<strong>–property=Type=exec</strong>) to ensure that <strong>systemd-run</strong> returns
successfully only if the specified command line has been successfully
started.</p>
<p>
After <strong>systemd-run</strong> passes the command to the service manager, the
manager performs variable expansion. This means that dollar characters
(&#34;$&#34;) which should not be expanded need to be escaped as &#34;$$&#34;. Expansion
can also be disabled using <em>–expand-environment=no</em>.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The following options are understood:</p>
<p>
<strong>–no-ask-password</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not query the user for authentication for privileged operations.</p>
<p>
Added in version 226.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–scope</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a transient .scope unit instead of the default transient .service
unit (see above).</p>
<p>
Added in version 206.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–unit=</strong>, <strong>-u</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use this unit name instead of an automatically generated one.</p>
<p>
Added in version 206.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–property=</strong>, <strong>-p</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets a property on the scope or service unit that is created. This
option takes an assignment in the same format as <strong>systemctl*(1)s
*set-property</strong> command.</p>
<p>
Added in version 211.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–description=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provide a description for the service, scope, path, socket, or timer
unit. If not specified, the command itself will be used as a
description. See <em>Description=</em> in *systemd.unit*(5).</p>
<p>
Added in version 206.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–slice=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make the new .service or .scope unit part of the specified slice,
instead of system.slice (when running in <strong>–system</strong> mode) or the root
slice (when running in <strong>–user</strong> mode).</p>
<p>
Added in version 206.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–slice-inherit</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make the new .service or .scope unit part of the slice the <strong>systemd-run</strong>
itself has been invoked in. This option may be combined with <strong>–slice=</strong>,
in which case the slice specified via <strong>–slice=</strong> is placed within the
slice the <strong>systemd-run</strong> command is invoked in.</p>
<p>
Example: consider <strong>systemd-run</strong> being invoked in the slice foo.slice,
and the <strong>–slice=</strong> argument is bar. The unit will then be placed under
foo-bar.slice.</p>
<p>
Added in version 246.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–expand-environment=*/BOOL/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Expand environment variables in command arguments. If enabled,
environment variables specified as &#34;${<em>VARIABLE</em>}&#34; will be expanded in
the same way as in commands specified via <em>ExecStart=</em> in units. With
<em>–scope</em>, this expansion is performed by <strong>systemd-run</strong> itself, and in
other cases by the service manager that spawns the command. Note that
this is similar to, but not the same as variable expansion in *bash*(1)
and other shells.</p>
<p>
The default is to enable this option in all cases, except for <em>–scope</em>
where it is disabled by default, for backward compatibility reasons.
Note that this will be changed in a future release, where it will be
switched to enabled by default as well.</p>
<p>
See *systemd.service*(5) for a description of variable expansion.
Disabling variable expansion is useful if the specified command includes
or may include a &#34;$&#34; sign.</p>
<p>
Added in version 254.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-r</strong>, <strong>–remain-after-exit</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the service process has terminated, keep the service around until
it is explicitly stopped. This is useful to collect runtime information
about the service after it finished running. Also see <em>RemainAfterExit=</em>
in *systemd.service*(5).</p>
<p>
Added in version 207.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–send-sighup</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When terminating the scope or service unit, send a SIGHUP immediately
after SIGTERM. This is useful to indicate to shells and shell-like
processes that the connection has been severed. Also see <em>SendSIGHUP=</em>
in *systemd.kill*(5).</p>
<p>
Added in version 207.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–service-type=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets the service type. Also see <em>Type=</em> in <strong>systemd.service*(5). This
option has no effect in conjunction with *–scope</strong>. Defaults to
<strong>simple</strong>.</p>
<p>
Added in version 211.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–uid=</strong>, <strong>–gid=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Runs the service process under the specified UNIX user and group. Also
see <em>User=</em> and <em>Group=</em> in *systemd.exec*(5).</p>
<p>
Added in version 211.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–nice=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Runs the service process with the specified nice level. Also see <em>Nice=</em>
in *systemd.exec*(5).</p>
<p>
Added in version 211.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–working-directory=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Runs the service process with the specified working directory. Also see
<em>WorkingDirectory=</em> in *systemd.exec*(5).</p>
<p>
Added in version 240.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–same-dir</strong>, <strong>-d</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similar to <strong>–working-directory=</strong>, but uses the current working
directory of the caller for the service to execute.</p>
<p>
Added in version 240.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-E */NAME/</strong>[=*/VALUE/*]*, <strong>–setenv=*/NAME/</strong>[=*/VALUE/*]*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Runs the service process with the specified environment variable set.
This parameter may be used more than once to set multiple variables.
When &#34;=&#34; and <em>VALUE</em> are omitted, the value of the variable with the
same name in the program environment will be used.</p>
<p>
Also see <em>Environment=</em> in *systemd.exec*(5).</p>
<p>
Added in version 211.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–pty</strong>, <strong>-t</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When invoking the command, the transient service connects its standard
input, output and error to the terminal <strong>systemd-run</strong> is invoked on, via
a pseudo TTY device. This allows running programs that expect
interactive user input/output as services, such as interactive command
shells.</p>
<p>
This option will result in <strong>systemd-run</strong> synchronously waiting for the
transient service to terminate, similar to specifying <strong>–wait</strong>. If
specified along with <strong>–wait</strong>, <strong>systemd-run</strong> wont exit when manually
disconnecting from the pseudo TTY device.</p>
<p>
Note that <strong>machinectl*(1)s *shell</strong> command is usually a better
alternative for requesting a new, interactive login session on the local
host or a local container.</p>
<p>
See below for details on how this switch combines with <strong>–pipe</strong>.</p>
<p>
Added in version 219.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–pipe</strong>, <strong>-P</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If specified, standard input, output, and error of the transient service
are inherited from the <strong>systemd-run</strong> command itself. This allows
<strong>systemd-run</strong> to be used within shell pipelines.</p>
<p>
Note that this mode is not suitable for interactive command shells and
similar, as the service process will not become a TTY controller when
invoked on a terminal. Use <strong>–pty</strong> instead in that case.</p>
<p>
When both <strong>–pipe</strong> and <strong>–pty</strong> are used in combination the more
appropriate option is automatically determined and used. Specifically,
when invoked with standard input, output and error connected to a TTY
<strong>–pty</strong> is used, and otherwise <strong>–pipe</strong>.</p>
<p>
This option will result in <strong>systemd-run</strong> synchronously waiting for the
transient service to terminate, similar to specifying <strong>–wait</strong>.</p>
<p>
When this option is used the original file descriptors <strong>systemd-run</strong>
receives are passed to the service processes as-is. If the service runs
with different privileges than <strong>systemd-run</strong>, this means the service
might not be able to reopen the passed file descriptors, due to normal
file descriptor access restrictions. If the invoked process is a shell
script that uses the <strong>echo &#34;hello&#34; &gt;/dev/stderr</strong> construct for writing
messages to stderr, this might cause problems, as this only works if
stderr can be reopened. To mitigate this use the construct <strong>echo &#34;hello&#34;
&gt;&amp;2</strong> instead, which is mostly equivalent and avoids this pitfall.</p>
<p>
Added in version 235.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–shell</strong>, <strong>-S</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A shortcut for &#34;–pty –same-dir –wait –collect –service-type=exec
$SHELL&#34;, i.e. requests an interactive shell in the current working
directory, running in service context, accessible with a single switch.</p>
<p>
Added in version 240.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–quiet</strong>, <strong>-q</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppresses additional informational output while running. This is
particularly useful in combination with <strong>–pty</strong> when it will suppress
the initial message explaining how to terminate the TTY connection.</p>
<p>
Added in version 219.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–on-active=</strong>, <strong>–on-boot=</strong>, <strong>–on-startup=</strong>, <strong>–on-unit-active=</strong>,
<strong>–on-unit-inactive=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defines a monotonic timer relative to different starting points for
starting the specified command. See <em>OnActiveSec=</em>, <em>OnBootSec=</em>,
<em>OnStartupSec=</em>, <em>OnUnitActiveSec=</em> and <em>OnUnitInactiveSec=</em> in
<strong>systemd.timer*(5) for details. These options are shortcuts for
*–timer-property=</strong> with the relevant properties. These options may not
be combined with <strong>–scope</strong> or <strong>–pty</strong>.</p>
<p>
Added in version 218.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–on-calendar=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defines a calendar timer for starting the specified command. See
<em>OnCalendar=</em> in <strong>systemd.timer*(5). This option is a shortcut for
*–timer-property=OnCalendar=</strong>. This option may not be combined with
<strong>–scope</strong> or <strong>–pty</strong>.</p>
<p>
Added in version 218.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–on-clock-change</strong>, <strong>–on-timezone-change</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defines a trigger based on system clock jumps or timezone changes for
starting the specified command. See <em>OnClockChange=</em> and
<em>OnTimezoneChange=</em> in <strong>systemd.timer*(5). These options are shortcuts
for *–timer-property=OnClockChange=yes</strong> and
<strong>–timer-property=OnTimezoneChange=yes</strong>. These options may not be
combined with <strong>–scope</strong> or <strong>–pty</strong>.</p>
<p>
Added in version 242.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–path-property=</strong>, <strong>–socket-property=</strong>, <strong>–timer-property=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets a property on the path, socket, or timer unit that is created. This
option is similar to <strong>–property=</strong>, but applies to the transient path,
socket, or timer unit rather than the transient service unit created.
This option takes an assignment in the same format as <strong>systemctl*(1)s
*set-property</strong> command. These options may not be combined with <strong>–scope</strong>
or <strong>–pty</strong>.</p>
<p>
Added in version 218.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–no-block</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not synchronously wait for the unit start operation to finish. If
this option is not specified, the start request for the transient unit
will be verified, enqueued and <strong>systemd-run</strong> will wait until the units
start-up is completed. By passing this argument, it is only verified and
enqueued. This option may not be combined with <strong>–wait</strong>.</p>
<p>
Added in version 220.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–wait</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synchronously wait for the transient service to terminate. If this
option is specified, the start request for the transient unit is
verified, enqueued, and waited for. Subsequently the invoked unit is
monitored, and it is waited until it is deactivated again (most likely
because the specified command completed). On exit, terse information
about the units runtime is shown, including total runtime (as well as
CPU usage, if <strong>–property=CPUAccounting=1</strong> was set) and the exit code
and status of the main process. This output may be suppressed with
<strong>–quiet</strong>. This option may not be combined with <strong>–no-block</strong>, <strong>–scope</strong>
or the various path, socket, or timer options.</p>
<p>
Added in version 232.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-G</strong>, <strong>–collect</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unload the transient unit after it completed, even if it failed.
Normally, without this option, all units that ran and failed are kept in
memory until the user explicitly resets their failure state with
<strong>systemctl reset-failed</strong> or an equivalent command. On the other hand,
units that ran successfully are unloaded immediately. If this option is
turned on the &#34;garbage collection&#34; of units is more aggressive, and
unloads units regardless if they exited successfully or failed. This
option is a shortcut for <strong>–property=CollectMode=inactive-or-failed</strong>,
see the explanation for <em>CollectMode=</em> in *systemd.unit*(5) for further
information.</p>
<p>
Added in version 236.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–ignore-failure</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, if the specified command fails the invoked unit will be
marked failed (though possibly still unloaded, see <strong>–collect=</strong>, above),
and this is reported in the logs. If this switch is specified this is
suppressed and any non-success exit status/code of the command is
treated as success.</p>
<p>
Added in version 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–background=*/COLOR/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Change the terminal background color to the specified ANSI color as long
as the session lasts. The color specified should be an ANSI X3.64 SGR
background color, i.e. strings such as &#34;40&#34;, &#34;41&#34;, …, &#34;47&#34;,
&#34;48;2;…&#34;, &#34;48;5;…&#34;. See <strong>ANSI Escape Code (Wikipedia)</strong>[1] for
details.</p>
<p>
Added in version 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–user</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Talk to the service manager of the calling user, rather than the service
manager of the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–system</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Talk to the service manager of the system. This is the implied default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-H</strong>, <strong>–host=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a username and
hostname separated by &#34;@&#34;, to connect to. The hostname may optionally be
suffixed by a port ssh is listening on, separated by &#34;:&#34;, and then a
container name, separated by &#34;/&#34;, which connects directly to a specific
container on the specified host. This will use SSH to talk to the remote
machine manager instance. Container names may be enumerated with
*machinectl -H */HOST/. Put IPv6 addresses in brackets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-M</strong>, <strong>–machine=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container name to
connect to, optionally prefixed by a user name to connect as and a
separating &#34;@&#34; character. If the special string &#34;.host&#34; is used in place
of the container name, a connection to the local system is made (which
is useful to connect to a specific users user bus: &#34;–user
–machine=lennart@.host&#34;). If the &#34;@&#34; syntax is not used, the connection
is made as root user. If the &#34;@&#34; syntax is used either the left hand
side or the right hand side may be omitted (but not both) in which case
the local user name and &#34;.host&#34; are implied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-C</strong>, <strong>–capsule=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Execute operation on a capsule. Specify a capsule name to connect to.
See *capsule@.service*(5) for details about capsules.</p>
<p>
Added in version 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-h</strong>, <strong>–help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short version string and exit.</p>

<strong>Example 4. Allowing access to the tty</strong></p>
<p>
The following command invokes *bash*(1) as a service passing its
standard input, output and error to the calling TTY.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# systemd-run -t --send-sighup bash
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Example 5. Start screen as a user service</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ systemd-run --scope --user screen
Running scope as unit run-r14b0047ab6df45bfb45e7786cc839e76.scope.

$ screen -ls
There is a screen on:
        492..laptop     (Detached)
1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-fatima.
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This starts the <strong>screen</strong> process as a child of the <strong>systemd –user</strong>
process that was started by user@.service, in a scope unit. A
<strong>systemd.scope*(5) unit is used instead of a *systemd.service*(5) unit,
because *screen</strong> will exit when detaching from the terminal, and a
service unit would be terminated. Running <strong>screen</strong> as a user unit has
the advantage that it is not part of the session scope. If
<em>KillUserProcesses=yes</em> is configured in *logind.conf*(5), the default,
the session scope will be terminated when the user logs out of that
session.</p>
<p>
The user@.service is started automatically when the user first logs in,
and stays around as long as at least one login session is open. After
the user logs out of the last session, user@.service and all services
underneath it are terminated. This behavior is the default, when
&#34;lingering&#34; is not enabled for that user. Enabling lingering means that
user@.service is started automatically during boot, even if the user is
not logged in, and that the service is not terminated when the user logs
out.</p>
<p>
Enabling lingering allows the user to run processes without being logged
in, for example to allow <strong>screen</strong> to persist after the user logs out,
even if the session scope is terminated. In the default configuration,
users can enable lingering for themselves:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ loginctl enable-linger
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Example 6. Variable expansion by the manager</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ systemd-run -t echo &#34;&lt;${INVOCATION_ID}&gt;&#34; &lt;${INVOCATION_ID}&gt;
      &lt;&gt; &lt;5d0149bfa2c34b79bccb13074001eb20&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The first argument is expanded by the shell (double quotes), but the
second one is not expanded by the shell (single quotes). *echo*(1) is
called with
[&#34;/usr/nix/store/ph44jcx3ddmlwh394mh1wb7f1qigxqb1-coreutils-9.5/bin/echo&#34;,
&#34;&lt;&gt;&#34;, &#34;&lt;${INVOCATION_ID}&gt;&#34;] as the argument array, and then *systemd*(1)
generates /${INVOCATION_ID}/ and substitutes it in the command-line.
This substitution could not be done on the client side, because the
target ID that will be set for the service isnt known before the call is
made.</p>
<p>
<strong>Example 7. Variable expansion and output redirection using a shell</strong></p>
<p>
Variable expansion by *systemd*(1) can be disabled with
<em>–expand-environment=no</em>.</p>
<p>
Disabling variable expansion can be useful if the command to execute
contains dollar characters and escaping them would be inconvenient. For
example, when a shell is used:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ systemd-run --expand-environment=no -t bash \
      -c echo $SHELL $$ &gt;/dev/stdout
/bin/bash 12345
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The last argument is passed verbatim to the *bash*(1) shell which is
started by the service unit. The shell expands &#34;$SHELL&#34; to the path of
the shell, and &#34;$$&#34; to its process number, and then those strings are
passed to the <strong>echo</strong> built-in and printed to standard output (which in
this case is connected to the calling terminal).</p>
<p>
<strong>Example 8. Return value</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ systemd-run --user --wait true
$ systemd-run --user --wait -p SuccessExitStatus=11 bash -c exit 11
$ systemd-run --user --wait -p SuccessExitStatus=SIGUSR1 --expand-environment=no \
      bash -c kill -SIGUSR1 $$
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Those three invocations will succeed, i.e. terminate with an exit code
of 0.</p>
