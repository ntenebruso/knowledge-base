DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>gpg</strong> is the OpenPGP part of the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG). It is a tool
to provide digital encryption and signing services using the OpenPGP
standard. <strong>gpg</strong> features complete key management and all the bells and
whistles you would expect from a full OpenPGP implementation.</p>
<p>
There are two main versions of GnuPG: GnuPG 1.x and GnuPG 2.x. GnuPG 2.x
supports modern encryption algorithms and thus should be preferred over
GnuPG 1.x. You only need to use GnuPG 1.x if your platform doesn&#39;t
support GnuPG 2.x, or you need support for some features that GnuPG 2.x
has deprecated, e.g., decrypting data created with PGP-2 keys.</p>
<p>
If you are looking for version 1 of GnuPG, you may find that version
installed under the name <strong>gpg1</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="headline-4">
RETURN VALUE
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The program returns 0 if there are no severe errors, 1 if at least a
signature was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.</p>
<p>
Note that signature verification requires exact knowledge of what has
been signed and by whom it has been signed. Using only the return code
is thus not an appropriate way to verify a signature by a script. Either
make proper use or the status codes or use the <strong>gpgv</strong> tool which has
been designed to make signature verification easy for scripts.</p>
</div>

WARNINGS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Use a good password for your user account and make sure that all
security issues are always fixed on your machine. Also employ diligent
physical protection to your machine. Consider to use a good passphrase
as a last resort protection to your secret key in the case your machine
gets stolen. It is important that your secret key is never leaked. Using
an easy to carry around token or smartcard with the secret key is often
a advisable.</p>
<p>
If you are going to verify detached signatures, make sure that the
program knows about it; either give both filenames on the command line
or use ‘-&#39; to specify STDIN.</p>
<p>
For scripted or other unattended use of <strong>gpg</strong> make sure to use the
machine-parseable interface and not the default interface which is
intended for direct use by humans. The machine-parseable interface
provides a stable and well documented API independent of the locale or
future changes of <strong>gpg</strong>. To enable this interface use the options
<strong>–with-colons</strong> and <strong>–status-fd</strong>. For certain operations the option
<strong>–command-fd</strong> may come handy too. See this man page and the file
‘/DETAILS/&#39; for the specification of the interface. Note that the GnuPG
``info&#39;&#39; pages as well as the PDF version of the GnuPG manual features a
chapter on unattended use of GnuPG. As an alternative the library
<strong>GPGME</strong> can be used as a high-level abstraction on top of that
interface.</p>

INTEROPERABILITY
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>GnuPG tries to be a very flexible implementation of the OpenPGP
standard. In particular, GnuPG implements many of the optional parts of
the standard, such as the SHA-512 hash, and the ZLIB and BZIP2
compression algorithms. It is important to be aware that not all OpenPGP
programs implement these optional algorithms and that by forcing their
use via the <strong>–cipher-algo</strong>, <strong>–digest-algo</strong>, <strong>–cert-digest-algo</strong>, or
<strong>–compress-algo</strong> options in GnuPG, it is possible to create a perfectly
valid OpenPGP message, but one that cannot be read by the intended
recipient.</p>
<p>
There are dozens of variations of OpenPGP programs available, and each
supports a slightly different subset of these optional algorithms. For
example, until recently, no (unhacked) version of PGP supported the
BLOWFISH cipher algorithm. A message using BLOWFISH simply could not be
read by a PGP user. By default, GnuPG uses the standard OpenPGP
preferences system that will always do the right thing and create
messages that are usable by all recipients, regardless of which OpenPGP
program they use. Only override this safe default if you really know
what you are doing.</p>
<p>
If you absolutely must override the safe default, or if the preferences
on a given key are invalid for some reason, you are far better off using
the <strong>–pgp6</strong>, <strong>–pgp7</strong>, or <strong>–pgp8</strong> options. These options are safe as
they do not force any particular algorithms in violation of OpenPGP, but
rather reduce the available algorithms to a &#34;PGP-safe&#34; list.</p>

COMMANDS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Commands are not distinguished from options except for the fact that
only one command is allowed. Generally speaking, irrelevant options are
silently ignored, and may not be checked for correctness.</p>
<p>
<strong>gpg</strong> may be run with no commands. In this case it will print a warning
perform a reasonable action depending on the type of file it is given as
input (an encrypted message is decrypted, a signature is verified, a
file containing keys is listed, etc.).</p>
<p>
If you run into any problems, please add the option <strong>–verbose</strong> to the
invocation to see more diagnostics.</p>

Commands to select the type of operation
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-3">
<ul>
<li><strong>–sign</strong><br>
<strong>-s</strong> :: Sign a message. This command may be combined with <strong>–encrypt</strong>
(to sign and encrypt a message), <strong>–symmetric</strong> (to sign and
symmetrically encrypt a message), or both <strong>–encrypt</strong> and
<strong>–symmetric</strong> (to sign and encrypt a message that can be decrypted
using a secret key or a passphrase). The signing key is chosen by
default or can be set explicitly using the <strong>–local-user</strong> and
<strong>–default-key</strong> options.</li>
<li><strong>–clear-sign</strong><br>
<strong>–clearsign</strong> :: Make a cleartext signature. The content in a
cleartext signature is readable without any special software. OpenPGP
software is only needed to verify the signature. cleartext signatures
may modify end-of-line whitespace for platform independence and are
not intended to be reversible. The signing key is chosen by default or
can be set explicitly using the <strong>–local-user</strong> and <strong>–default-key</strong>
options.</li>
<li><strong>–detach-sign</strong><br>
<strong>-b</strong> :: Make a detached signature.</li>
<li><strong>–encrypt</strong><br>
<strong>-e</strong> :: Encrypt data to one or more public keys. This command may be
combined with <strong>–sign</strong> (to sign and encrypt a message), <strong>–symmetric</strong>
(to encrypt a message that can be decrypted using a secret key or a
passphrase), or <strong>–sign</strong> and <strong>–symmetric</strong> together (for a signed
message that can be decrypted using a secret key or a passphrase).
<strong>–recipient</strong> and related options specify which public keys to use for
encryption.</li>
<li><strong>–symmetric</strong><br>
<strong>-c</strong> :: Encrypt with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase. The
default symmetric cipher used is AES-128, but may be chosen with the
<strong>–cipher-algo</strong> option. This command may be combined with <strong>–sign</strong>
(for a signed and symmetrically encrypted message), <strong>–encrypt</strong> (for a
message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase), or
<strong>–sign</strong> and <strong>–encrypt</strong> together (for a signed message that may be
decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase). <strong>gpg</strong> caches the
passphrase used for symmetric encryption so that a decrypt operation
may not require that the user needs to enter the passphrase. The
option <strong>–no-symkey-cache</strong> can be used to disable this feature.</li>
<li><strong>–store</strong> :: Store only (make a simple literal data packet).</li>
<li><strong>–decrypt</strong><br>
<strong>-d</strong> :: Decrypt the file given on the command line (or STDIN if no
file is specified) and write it to STDOUT (or the file specified with
<strong>–output</strong>). If the decrypted file is signed, the signature is also
verified. This command differs from the default operation, as it never
writes to the filename which is included in the file and it rejects
files that don&#39;t begin with an encrypted message.</li>
<li><strong>–verify</strong> :: Assume that the first argument is a signed file and
verify it without generating any output. With no arguments, the
signature packet is read from STDIN. If only one argument is given,
the specified file is expected to include a complete signature.

With more than one argument, the first argument should specify a file
with a detached signature and the remaining files should contain the
signed data. To read the signed data from STDIN, use ‘-&#39; as the second
filename. For security reasons, a detached signature will not read the
signed material from STDIN if not explicitly specified.

Note: If the option <strong>–batch</strong> is not used, <strong>gpg</strong> may assume that a
single argument is a file with a detached signature, and it will try
to find a matching data file by stripping certain suffixes. Using this
historical feature to verify a detached signature is strongly
discouraged; you should always specify the data file explicitly.

Note: When verifying a cleartext signature, <strong>gpg</strong> verifies only what
makes up the cleartext signed data and not any extra data outside of
the cleartext signature or the header lines directly following the
dash marker line. The option <strong>–output</strong> may be used to write out the
actual signed data, but there are other pitfalls with this format as
well. It is suggested to avoid cleartext signatures in favor of
detached signatures.

Note: To check whether a file was signed by a certain key the option
<strong>–assert-signer</strong> can be used. As an alternative the <strong>gpgv</strong> tool can
be used. <strong>gpgv</strong> is designed to compare signed data against a list of
trusted keys and returns with success only for a good signature. It
has its own manual page.</li>
<li><strong>–multifile</strong> :: This modifies certain other commands to accept
multiple files for processing on the command line or read from STDIN
with each filename on a separate line. This allows for many files to
be processed at once. <strong>–multifile</strong> may currently be used along with
<strong>–verify</strong>, <strong>–encrypt</strong>, and <strong>–decrypt</strong>. Note that <strong>–multifile
–verify</strong> may not be used with detached signatures.</li>
<li><strong>–verify-files</strong> :: Identical to <strong>–multifile –verify</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>–encrypt-files</strong> :: Identical to <strong>–multifile –encrypt</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>–decrypt-files</strong> :: Identical to <strong>–multifile –decrypt</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>–list-keys</strong><br>
<strong>-k</strong><br>
<strong>–list-public-keys</strong> :: List the specified keys. If no keys are
specified, then all keys from the configured public keyrings are
listed.

Never use the output of this command in scripts or other programs. The
output is intended only for humans and its format is likely to change.
The <strong>–with-colons</strong> option emits the output in a stable,
machine-parseable format, which is intended for use by scripts and
other programs.</li>
<li><strong>–list-secret-keys</strong><br>
<strong>-K</strong> :: List the specified secret keys. If no keys are specified, then
all known secret keys are listed. A <strong>#</strong> after the initial tags <strong>sec</strong>
or <strong>ssb</strong> means that the secret key or subkey is currently not usable.
We also say that this key has been taken offline (for example, a
primary key can be taken offline by exporting the key using the
command <strong>–export-secret-subkeys</strong>). A <strong>&gt;</strong> after these tags indicate
that the key is stored on a smartcard. See also <strong>–list-keys</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>–check-signatures</strong><br>
<strong>–check-sigs</strong> :: Same as <strong>–list-keys</strong>, but the key signatures are
verified and listed too. Note that for performance reasons the
revocation status of a signing key is not shown. This command has the
same effect as using <strong>–list-keys</strong> with <strong>–with-sig-check</strong>.

The status of the verification is indicated by a flag directly
following the &#34;sig&#34; tag (and thus before the flags described below. A
&#34;!&#34; indicates that the signature has been successfully verified, a &#34;-&#34;
denotes a bad signature and a &#34;%&#34; is used if an error occurred while
checking the signature (e.g. a non supported algorithm). Signatures
where the public key is not available are not listed; to see their
keyids the command <strong>–list-sigs</strong> can be used.

For each signature listed, there are several flags in between the
signature status flag and keyid. These flags give additional
information about each key signature. From left to right, they are the
numbers 1-3 for certificate check level (see <strong>–ask-cert-level</strong>), &#34;L&#34;
for a local or non-exportable signature (see <strong>–lsign-key</strong>), &#34;R&#34; for a
nonRevocable signature (see the <strong>–edit-key</strong> command &#34;nrsign&#34;), &#34;P&#34;
for a signature that contains a policy URL (see <strong>–cert-policy-url</strong>),
&#34;N&#34; for a signature that contains a notation (see <strong>–cert-notation</strong>),
&#34;X&#34; for an eXpired signature (see <strong>–ask-cert-expire</strong>), and the
numbers 1-9 or &#34;T&#34; for 10 and above to indicate trust signature levels
(see the <strong>–edit-key</strong> command &#34;tsign&#34;).</li>
<li><strong>–locate-keys</strong><br>
<strong>–locate-external-keys</strong> :: Locate the keys given as arguments. This
command basically uses the same algorithm as used when locating keys
for encryption and may thus be used to see what keys <strong>gpg</strong> might use.
In particular external methods as defined by <strong>–auto-key-locate</strong> are
used to locate a key if the arguments comain valid mail addresses.
Only public keys are listed.

The variant <strong>–locate-external-keys</strong> does not consider a locally
existing key and can thus be used to force the refresh of a key via
the defined external methods. If a fingerprint is given and and the
methods defined by –auto-key-locate define LDAP servers, the key is
fetched from these resources; defined non-LDAP keyservers are skipped.</li>
<li><strong>–show-keys</strong> :: This commands takes OpenPGP keys as input and prints
information about them in the same way the command <strong>–list-keys</strong> does
for locally stored key. In addition the list options
<strong>show-unusable-uids</strong>, <strong>show-unusable-subkeys</strong>, <strong>show-notations</strong> and
<strong>show-policy-urls</strong> are also enabled. As usual for automated
processing, this command should be combined with the option
<strong>–with-colons</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>–fingerprint</strong> :: List all keys (or the specified ones) along with
their fingerprints. This is the same output as <strong>–list-keys</strong> but with
the additional output of a line with the fingerprint. May also be
combined with <strong>–check-signatures</strong>. If this command is given twice,
the fingerprints of all secondary keys are listed too. This command
also forces pretty printing of fingerprints if the keyid format has
been set to &#34;none&#34;.</li>
<li><strong>–list-packets</strong> :: List only the sequence of packets. This command is
only useful for debugging. When used with option <strong>–verbose</strong> the
actual MPI values are dumped and not only their lengths. Note that the
output of this command may change with new releases.</li>
<li><strong>–edit-card</strong><br>
<strong>–card-edit</strong> :: Present a menu to work with a smartcard. The
subcommand &#34;help&#34; provides an overview on available commands. For a
detailed description, please see the Card HOWTO at
<a href="https://gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.html#GnuPG-cardHOWTO">https://gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.html#GnuPG-cardHOWTO</a> . Please
note that the command &#34;openpgp&#34; can be used to switch to the OpenPGP
application of cards which by default are presenting another
application (e.g. PIV).</li>
<li><strong>–card-status</strong> :: Show the content of the smart card.</li>
<li><strong>–change-pin</strong> :: Present a menu to allow changing the PIN of a
smartcard. This functionality is also available as the subcommand
&#34;passwd&#34; with the <strong>–edit-card</strong> command.</li>
<li><strong>–delete-keys <em>name</em></strong> :: Remove key from the public keyring. In batch
mode either <strong>–yes</strong> is required or the key must be specified by
fingerprint. This is a safeguard against accidental deletion of
multiple keys. If the exclamation mark syntax is used with the
fingerprint of a subkey only that subkey is deleted; if the
exclamation mark is used with the fingerprint of the primary key the
entire public key is deleted.</li>
<li><strong>–delete-secret-keys <em>name</em></strong> :: Remove key from the secret keyring.
In batch mode the key must be specified by fingerprint. The option
<strong>–yes</strong> can be used to advise gpg-agent not to request a confirmation.
This extra pre-caution is done because <strong>gpg</strong> can&#39;t be sure that the
secret key (as controlled by gpg-agent) is only used for the given
OpenPGP public key. If the exclamation mark syntax is used with the
fingerprint of a subkey only the secret part of that subkey is
deleted; if the exclamation mark is used with the fingerprint of the
primary key only the secret part of the primary key is deleted.</li>
<li><strong>–delete-secret-and-public-key <em>name</em></strong> :: Same as <strong>–delete-key</strong>, but
if a secret key exists, it will be removed first. In batch mode the
key must be specified by fingerprint. The option <strong>–yes</strong> can be used
to advise gpg-agent not to request a confirmation.</li>
<li><strong>–export</strong> :: Either export all keys from all keyrings (default
keyring and those registered via option <strong>–keyring</strong>), or if at least
one name is given, those of the given name. The exported keys are
written to STDOUT or to the file given with option <strong>–output</strong>. Use
together with <strong>–armor</strong> to mail those keys.</li>
<li><strong>–send-keys <em>keyIDs</em></strong> :: Similar to <strong>–export</strong> but sends the keys to
a keyserver. Fingerprints may be used instead of key IDs. Don&#39;t send
your complete keyring to a keyserver — select only those keys which
are new or changed by you. If no <em>keyIDs</em> are given, <strong>gpg</strong> does
nothing.

Take care: Keyservers are by design write only systems and thus it is
not possible to ever delete keys once they have been send to a
keyserver.</li>
<li><strong>–export-secret-keys</strong><br>
<strong>–export-secret-subkeys</strong> :: Same as <strong>–export</strong>, but exports the
secret keys instead. The exported keys are written to STDOUT or to the
file given with option <strong>–output</strong>. This command is often used along
with the option <strong>–armor</strong> to allow for easy printing of the key for
paper backup; however the external tool <strong>paperkey</strong> does a better job
of creating backups on paper. Note that exporting a secret key can be
a security risk if the exported keys are sent over an insecure
channel.

The second form of the command has the special property to render the
secret part of the primary key useless; this is a GNU extension to
OpenPGP and other implementations can not be expected to successfully
import such a key. Its intended use is in generating a full key with
an additional signing subkey on a dedicated machine. This command then
exports the key without the primary key to the main machine.

GnuPG may ask you to enter the passphrase for the key. This is
required, because the internal protection method of the secret key is
different from the one specified by the OpenPGP protocol.</li>
<li><strong>–export-ssh-key</strong> :: This command is used to export a key in the
OpenSSH public key format. It requires the specification of one key by
the usual means and exports the latest valid subkey which has an
authentication capability to STDOUT or to the file given with option
<strong>–output</strong>. That output can directly be added to ssh&#39;s
‘/authorized_key/&#39; file.

By specifying the key to export using a key ID or a fingerprint
suffixed with an exclamation mark (!), a specific subkey or the
primary key can be exported. This does not even require that the key
has the authentication capability flag set.</li>
<li><strong>–import</strong><br>
<strong>–fast-import</strong> :: Import/merge keys. This adds the given keys to the
keyring. The fast version is currently just a synonym.

There are a few other options which control how this command works.
Most notable here is the <strong>–import-options merge-only</strong> option which
does not insert new keys but does only the merging of new signatures,
user-IDs and subkeys.</li>
<li><strong>–receive-keys <em>keyIDs</em></strong><br>
<strong>–recv-keys <em>keyIDs</em></strong> :: Import the keys with the given <em>keyIDs</em> from
a keyserver.</li>
<li><strong>–refresh-keys</strong> :: Request updates from a keyserver for keys that
already exist on the local keyring. This is useful for updating a key
with the latest signatures, user IDs, etc. Calling this with no
arguments will refresh the entire keyring.</li>
<li><strong>–search-keys <em>names</em></strong> :: Search the keyserver for the given <em>names</em>.
Multiple names given here will be joined together to create the search
string for the keyserver. Note that keyservers search for <em>names</em> in a
different and simpler way than gpg does. The best choice is to use a
mail address. Due to data privacy reasons keyservers may even not even
allow searching by user id or mail address and thus may only return
results when being used with the <strong>–recv-key</strong> command to search by key
fingerprint or keyid.</li>
<li><strong>–fetch-keys <em>URIs</em></strong> :: Retrieve keys located at the specified
<em>URIs</em>. Note that different installations of GnuPG may support
different protocols (HTTP, FTP, LDAP, etc.). When using HTTPS the
system provided root certificates are used by this command.</li>
<li><strong>–update-trustdb</strong> :: Do trust database maintenance. This command
iterates over all keys and builds the Web of Trust. This is an
interactive command because it may have to ask for the &#34;ownertrust&#34;
values for keys. The user has to give an estimation of how far she
trusts the owner of the displayed key to correctly certify (sign)
other keys. GnuPG only asks for the ownertrust value if it has not yet
been assigned to a key. Using the <strong>–edit-key</strong> menu, the assigned
value can be changed at any time.</li>
<li><strong>–check-trustdb</strong> :: Do trust database maintenance without user
interaction. From time to time the trust database must be updated so
that expired keys or signatures and the resulting changes in the Web
of Trust can be tracked. Normally, GnuPG will calculate when this is
required and do it automatically unless <strong>–no-auto-check-trustdb</strong> is
set. This command can be used to force a trust database check at any
time. The processing is identical to that of <strong>–update-trustdb</strong> but it
skips keys with a not yet defined &#34;ownertrust&#34;.

For use with cron jobs, this command can be used together with
<strong>–batch</strong> in which case the trust database check is done only if a
check is needed. To force a run even in batch mode add the option
<strong>–yes</strong>.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>–export-ownertrust</strong> :: Send the ownertrust values to STDOUT. This is
useful for backup purposes as these values are the only ones which
can&#39;t be re-created from a corrupted trustdb. Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
  gpg --export-ownertrust &gt; otrust.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>–import-ownertrust</strong> :: Update the trustdb with the ownertrust values
stored in <strong>files</strong> (or STDIN if not given); existing values will be
overwritten. In case of a severely damaged trustdb and if you have a
recent backup of the ownertrust values (e.g. in the file
‘/otrust.txt/&#39;), you may re-create the trustdb using these commands:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
  cd ~/.gnupg
  rm trustdb.gpg
  gpg --import-ownertrust &lt; otrust.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>–rebuild-keydb-caches</strong> :: When updating from version 1.0.6 to 1.0.7
this command should be used to create signature caches in the keyring.
It might be handy in other situations too.</li>
<li><strong>–print-md <em>algo</em></strong><br>
<strong>–print-mds</strong> :: Print message digest of algorithm <em>algo</em> for all
given files or STDIN. With the second form (or a deprecated &#34;*&#34; for
<em>algo</em>) digests for all available algorithms are printed.</li>
<li><strong>–gen-random <em>0|1|2|16|30</em> <em>count</em></strong> :: Emit <em>count</em> random bytes of
the given quality level 0, 1 or 2. If <em>count</em> is not given or zero, an
endless sequence of random bytes will be emitted. If used with
<strong>–armor</strong> the output will be base64 encoded. The special level 16 uses
a quality level of 1 and outputs an endless stream of hex-encoded
octets. The special level 30 outputs random as 30 zBase-32 characters.</li>
<li><strong>–gen-prime <em>mode</em> <em>bits</em></strong> :: Use the source, Luke :-). The output
format is subject to change with any release.</li>
<li><strong>–enarmor</strong><br>
<strong>–dearmor</strong> :: Pack or unpack an arbitrary input into/from an OpenPGP
ASCII armor. This is a GnuPG extension to OpenPGP and in general not
very useful. The <strong>–dearmor</strong> command can also be used to dearmor PEM
armors.</li>
<li><strong>–unwrap</strong> :: This option modifies the command <strong>–decrypt</strong> to output
the original message with the encryption layer removed. Thus the
output will be an OpenPGP data structure which often means a signed
OpenPGP message. Note that this option may or may not remove a
compression layer which is often found beneath the encryption layer.</li>
<li><strong>–tofu-policy {auto|good|unknown|bad|ask} <em>keys</em></strong> :: Set the TOFU
policy for all the bindings associated with the specified <em>keys</em>. For
more information about the meaning of the policies, see:
[trust-model-tofu]. The <em>keys</em> may be specified either by their
fingerprint (preferred) or their keyid.</li>

How to manage your keys
</h3>

<p>
This section explains the main commands for key management.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>–quick-generate-key <em>user-id</em> [/algo/ [/usage/ [/expire/]]]</strong><br>
<strong>–quick-gen-key</strong> :: This is a simple command to generate a standard
key with one user id. In contrast to <strong>–generate-key</strong> the key is
generated directly without the need to answer a bunch of prompts.
Unless the option <strong>–yes</strong> is given, the key creation will be canceled
if the given user id already exists in the keyring.

If invoked directly on the console without any special options an
answer to a ``Continue?&#39;&#39; style confirmation prompt is required. In
case the user id already exists in the keyring a second prompt to
force the creation of the key will show up.

If <em>algo</em> or <em>usage</em> are given, only the primary key is created and no
prompts are shown. To specify an expiration date but still create a
primary and subkey use ``default&#39;&#39; or ``future-default&#39;&#39; for <em>algo</em>
and ``default&#39;&#39; for <em>usage</em>. For a description of these optional
arguments see the command <strong>–quick-add-key</strong>. The <em>usage</em> accepts also
the value ``cert&#39;&#39; which can be used to create a certification only
primary key; the default is to a create certification and signing key.

The <em>expire</em> argument can be used to specify an expiration date for
the key. Several formats are supported; commonly the ISO formats
``YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&#39; or ``YYYYMMDDThhmmss&#39;&#39; are used. To make the key expire
in N seconds, N days, N weeks, N months, or N years use ``seconds=N&#39;&#39;,
``Nd&#39;&#39;, ``Nw&#39;&#39;, ``Nm&#39;&#39;, or ``Ny&#39;&#39; respectively. Not specifying a
value, or using ``-&#39;&#39; results in a key expiring in a reasonable
default interval. The values ``never&#39;&#39;, ``none&#39;&#39; can be used for no
expiration date.

If this command is used with <strong>–batch</strong>, <strong>–pinentry-mode</strong> has been set
to <strong>loopback</strong>, and one of the passphrase options (<strong>–passphrase</strong>,
<strong>–passphrase-fd</strong>, or <strong>–passphrase-file</strong>) is used, the supplied
passphrase is used for the new key and the agent does not ask for it.
To create a key without any protection <strong>–passphrase &#39;&#39;</strong> may be used.

To create an OpenPGP key from the keys available on the currently
inserted smartcard, the special string ``card&#39;&#39; can be used for
<em>algo</em>. If the card features an encryption and a signing key, gpg will
figure them out and creates an OpenPGP key consisting of the usual
primary key and one subkey. This works only with certain smartcards.
Note that the interactive <strong>–full-gen-key</strong> command allows one to do
the same but with greater flexibility in the selection of the
smartcard keys.

Note that it is possible to create a primary key and a subkey using
non-default algorithms by using ``default&#39;&#39; and changing the default
parameters using the option <strong>–default-new-key-algo</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>–quick-set-expire <em>fpr</em> <em>expire</em> [*|/subfprs/]</strong> :: With two
arguments given, directly set the expiration time of the primary key
identified by <em>fpr</em> to <em>expire</em>. To remove the expiration time <strong>0</strong> can
be used. With three arguments and the third given as an asterisk, the
expiration time of all non-revoked and not yet expired subkeys are set
to <em>expire</em>. With more than two arguments and a list of fingerprints
given for <em>subfprs</em>, all non-revoked subkeys matching these
fingerprints are set to <em>expire</em>.</li>
<li><strong>–quick-add-key <em>fpr</em> [/algo/ [/usage/ [/expire/]]]</strong> :: Directly add
a subkey to the key identified by the fingerprint <em>fpr</em>. Without the
optional arguments an encryption subkey is added. If any of the
arguments are given a more specific subkey is added.

<em>algo</em> may be any of the supported algorithms or curve names given in
the format as used by key listings. To use the default algorithm the
string ``default&#39;&#39; or ``-&#39;&#39; can be used. Supported algorithms are
``rsa&#39;&#39;, ``dsa&#39;&#39;, ``elg&#39;&#39;, ``ed25519&#39;&#39;, ``cv25519&#39;&#39;, and other ECC
curves. For example the string ``rsa&#39;&#39; adds an RSA key with the
default key length; a string ``rsa4096&#39;&#39; requests that the key length
is 4096 bits. The string ``future-default&#39;&#39; is an alias for the
algorithm which will likely be used as default algorithm in future
versions of gpg. To list the supported ECC curves the command <strong>gpg
–with-colons –list-config curve</strong> can be used.

Depending on the given <em>algo</em> the subkey may either be an encryption
subkey or a signing subkey. If an algorithm is capable of signing and
encryption and such a subkey is desired, a <em>usage</em> string must be
given. This string is either ``default&#39;&#39; or ``-&#39;&#39; to keep the default
or a comma delimited list (or space delimited list) of keywords:
``sign&#39;&#39; for a signing subkey, ``auth&#39;&#39; for an authentication subkey,
and ``encr&#39;&#39; for an encryption subkey (``encrypt&#39;&#39; can be used as
alias for ``encr&#39;&#39;). The valid combinations depend on the algorithm.

The <em>expire</em> argument can be used to specify an expiration date for
the key. Several formats are supported; commonly the ISO formats
``YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&#39; or ``YYYYMMDDThhmmss&#39;&#39; are used. To make the key expire
in N seconds, N days, N weeks, N months, or N years use ``seconds=N&#39;&#39;,
``Nd&#39;&#39;, ``Nw&#39;&#39;, ``Nm&#39;&#39;, or ``Ny&#39;&#39; respectively. Not specifying a
value, or using ``-&#39;&#39; results in a key expiring in a reasonable
default interval. The values ``never&#39;&#39;, ``none&#39;&#39; can be used for no
expiration date.</li>
<li><strong>–quick-add-adsk <em>fpr</em> <em>adskfpr</em></strong> :: Directly add an Additional
Decryption Subkey to the key identified by the fingerprint <em>fpr</em>.
<em>adskfpr</em> is the fingerprint of another key&#39;s encryption subkey. A
subkey is commonly used here because by default a primary key has no
encryption capability. Use the option <strong>–with-subkey-fingerprint</strong> with
a list command to display the subkey fingerprints.</li>
<li><strong>–generate-key</strong><br>
<strong>–gen-key</strong> :: Generate a new key pair using the current default
parameters. This is the standard command to create a new key. In
addition to the key a revocation certificate is created and stored in
the ‘/openpgp-revocs.d/&#39; directory below the GnuPG home directory.</li>
<li><strong>–full-generate-key</strong><br>
<strong>–full-gen-key</strong> :: Generate a new key pair with dialogs for all
options. This is an extended version of <strong>–generate-key</strong>.

There is also a feature which allows you to create keys in batch mode.
See the manual section ``Unattended key generation&#39;&#39; on how to use
this.</li>
<li><strong>–generate-revocation <em>name</em></strong><br>
<strong>–gen-revoke <em>name</em></strong> :: Generate a revocation certificate for the
complete key. To only revoke a subkey or a key signature, use the
<strong>–edit</strong> command.

This command merely creates the revocation certificate so that it can
be used to revoke the key if that is ever needed. To actually revoke a
key the created revocation certificate needs to be merged with the key
to revoke. This is done by importing the revocation certificate using
the <strong>–import</strong> command. Then the revoked key needs to be published,
which is best done by sending the key to a keyserver (command
<strong>–send-key</strong>) and by exporting (<strong>–export</strong>) it to a file which is then
send to frequent communication partners.</li>
<li><strong>–generate-designated-revocation <em>name</em></strong><br>
<strong>–desig-revoke <em>name</em></strong> :: Generate a designated revocation
certificate for a key. This allows a user (with the permission of the
keyholder) to revoke someone else&#39;s key.</li>
<li><strong>–edit-key</strong> :: Present a menu which enables you to do most of the key
management related tasks. It expects the specification of a key on the
command line.</li>

<dd>Make a signature on key of user <strong>name</strong>. If the key is not
yet signed by the default user (or the users given with <strong>-u</strong>), the
program displays the information of the key again, together with its
fingerprint and asks whether it should be signed. This question is
repeated for all users specified with <strong>-u</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>lsign</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Same as &#34;sign&#34; but the signature is marked as
non-exportable and will therefore never be used by others. This may be
used to make keys valid only in the local environment.</dd>

<dt>
<strong>tsign</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Make a trust signature. This is a signature that combines
the notions of certification (like a regular signature), and trust
(like the &#34;trust&#34; command). It is generally useful in distinct
communities or groups to implement the concept of a Trusted
Introducer. For more information please read the sections ``Trust
Signature&#39;&#39; and ``Regular Expression&#39;&#39; in RFC-4880.</dd>

<p>
If the option <strong>–only-sign-text-ids</strong> is specified, then any non-text
based user ids (e.g., photo IDs) will not be selected for signing.</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>delsig</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Delete a signature. Note that it is not possible to
retract a signature, once it has been send to the public (i.e. to a
keyserver). In that case you better use <strong>revsig</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>revsig</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Revoke a signature. For every signature which has been
generated by one of the secret keys, GnuPG asks whether a revocation
certificate should be generated.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>check</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Check the signatures on all selected user IDs. With the
extra option <strong>selfsig</strong> only self-signatures are shown.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>adduid</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Create an additional user ID.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>addphoto</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Create a photographic user ID. This will prompt for a
JPEG file that will be embedded into the user ID. Note that a very
large JPEG will make for a very large key. Also note that some
programs will display your JPEG unchanged (GnuPG), and some programs
will scale it to fit in a dialog box (PGP).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>showphoto</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Display the selected photographic user ID.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>deluid</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Delete a user ID or photographic user ID. Note that it is
not possible to retract a user id, once it has been send to the public
(i.e. to a keyserver). In that case you better use <strong>revuid</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>revuid</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Revoke a user ID or photographic user ID.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>primary</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Flag the current user id as the primary one, removes the
primary user id flag from all other user ids and sets the timestamp of
all affected self-signatures one second ahead. Note that setting a
photo user ID as primary makes it primary over other photo user IDs,
and setting a regular user ID as primary makes it primary over other
regular user IDs.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>keyserver</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set a preferred keyserver for the specified user ID(s).
This allows other users to know where you prefer they get your key
from. See <strong>–keyserver-options honor-keyserver-url</strong> for more on how
this works. Setting a value of &#34;none&#34; removes an existing preferred
keyserver.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>notation</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set a name=value notation for the specified user ID(s).
See <strong>–cert-notation</strong> for more on how this works. Setting a value of
&#34;none&#34; removes all notations, setting a notation prefixed with a minus
sign (-) removes that notation, and setting a notation name (without
the =value) prefixed with a minus sign removes all notations with that
name.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>pref</strong>
</dt>
<dd>List preferences from the selected user ID. This shows the
actual preferences, without including any implied preferences.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>showpref</strong>
</dt>
<dd>More verbose preferences listing for the selected user
ID. This shows the preferences in effect by including the implied
preferences of 3DES (cipher), SHA-1 (digest), and Uncompressed
(compression) if they are not already included in the preference list.
In addition, the preferred keyserver and signature notations (if any)
are shown.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>setpref <em>string</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set the list of user ID preferences to <em>string</em>
for all (or just the selected) user IDs. Calling setpref with no
arguments sets the preference list to the default (either built-in or
set via <strong>–default-preference-list</strong>), and calling setpref with &#34;none&#34;
as the argument sets an empty preference list. Use <strong>gpg</strong> –version to
get a list of available algorithms. Note that while you can change the
preferences on an attribute user ID (aka &#34;photo ID&#34;), GnuPG does not
select keys via attribute user IDs so these preferences will not be
used by GnuPG. Note that an unattended version of this command is
available as <strong>–quick-update-pref</strong>.

When setting preferences, you should list the algorithms in the order
which you&#39;d like to see them used by someone else when encrypting a
message to your key. If you don&#39;t include 3DES, it will be
automatically added at the end. Note that there are many factors that
go into choosing an algorithm (for example, your key may not be the
only recipient), and so the remote OpenPGP application being used to
send to you may or may not follow your exact chosen order for a given
message. It will, however, only choose an algorithm that is present on
the preference list of every recipient key. See also the
INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS section below.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>addkey</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Add a subkey to this key.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>addcardkey</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Generate a subkey on a card and add it to this key.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>keytocard</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Transfer the selected secret subkey (or the primary key
if no subkey has been selected) to a smartcard. The secret key in the
keyring will be replaced by a stub if the key could be stored
successfully on the card and you use the save command later. Only
certain key types may be transferred to the card. A sub menu allows
you to select on what card to store the key. Note that it is not
possible to get that key back from the card - if the card gets broken
your secret key will be lost unless you have a backup somewhere.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>bkuptocard <em>file</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Restore the given <em>file</em> to a card. This
command may be used to restore a backup key (as generated during card
initialization) to a new card. In almost all cases this will be the
encryption key. You should use this command only with the
corresponding public key and make sure that the file given as argument
is indeed the backup to restore. You should then select 2 to restore
as encryption key. You will first be asked to enter the passphrase of
the backup key and then for the Admin PIN of the card.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>keytotpm</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Transfer the selected secret subkey (or the primary key
if no subkey has been selected) to TPM form. The secret key in the
keyring will be replaced by the TPM representation of that key, which
can only be read by the particular TPM that created it (so the keyfile
now becomes locked to the laptop containing the TPM). Only certain key
types may be transferred to the TPM (all TPM 2.0 systems are mandated
to have the rsa2048 and nistp256 algorithms but newer TPMs may have
more). Note that the key itself is not transferred into the TPM,
merely encrypted by the TPM in-place, so if the keyfile is deleted,
the key will be lost. Once transferred to TPM representation, the key
file can never be converted back to non-TPM form and the key will die
when the TPM does, so you should first have a backup on secure offline
storage of the actual secret key file before conversion. It is
essential to use the physical system TPM that you have rw permission
on the TPM resource manager device (/dev/tpmrm0). Usually this means
you must be a member of the tss group.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>delkey</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Remove a subkey (secondary key). Note that it is not
possible to retract a subkey, once it has been send to the public
(i.e. to a keyserver). In that case you better use <strong>revkey</strong>. Also note
that this only deletes the public part of a key.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>revkey</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Revoke a subkey.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>expire</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Change the key or subkey expiration time. If a subkey is
selected, the expiration time of this subkey will be changed. With no
selection, the key expiration of the primary key is changed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>trust</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Change the owner trust value for the key. This updates the
trust-db immediately and no save is required.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>disable</strong><br>
<strong>enable</strong> :: Disable or enable an entire key. A disabled key can not
normally be used for encryption.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>addrevoker</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Add a designated revoker to the key. This takes one
optional argument: &#34;sensitive&#34;. If a designated revoker is marked as
sensitive, it will not be exported by default (see export-options).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>addadsk</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Add an Additional Decryption Subkey. The user is asked to
enter the fingerprint of another encryption subkey. Note that the
exact fingerprint of another key&#39;s encryption subkey needs to be
entered. This is because commonly the primary key has no encryption
capability. Use the option <strong>–with-subkey-fingerprint</strong> with a list
command to display the subkey fingerprints.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>passwd</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Change the passphrase of the secret key.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>toggle</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is dummy command which exists only for backward
compatibility.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>clean</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Compact (by removing all signatures except the selfsig) any
user ID that is no longer usable (e.g. revoked, or expired). Then,
remove any signatures that are not usable by the trust calculations.
Specifically, this removes any signature that does not validate, any
signature that is superseded by a later signature, revoked signatures,
and signatures issued by keys that are not present on the keyring.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>minimize</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Make the key as small as possible. This removes all
signatures from each user ID except for the most recent
self-signature.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>change-usage</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Change the usage flags (capabilities) of the primary
key or of subkeys. These usage flags (e.g. Certify, Sign,
Authenticate, Encrypt) are set during key creation. Sometimes it is
useful to have the opportunity to change them (for example to add
Authenticate) after they have been created. Please take care when
doing this; the allowed usage flags depend on the key algorithm.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>cross-certify</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Add cross-certification signatures to signing
subkeys that may not currently have them. Cross-certification
signatures protect against a subtle attack against signing subkeys.
See <strong>–require-cross-certification</strong>. All new keys generated have this
signature by default, so this command is only useful to bring older
keys up to date.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>save</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Save all changes to the keyring and quit.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>quit</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Quit the program without updating the keyring.</dd>

</dt>
<dd><strong>–quick-sign-key <em>fpr</em> [/names/]</strong><br>
<strong>–quick-lsign-key <em>fpr</em> [/names/]</strong> :: Directly sign a key from the
passphrase without any further user interaction. The <em>fpr</em> must be the
verified primary fingerprint of a key in the local keyring. If no
<em>names</em> are given, all useful user ids are signed; with given
[/names/] only useful user ids matching one of these names are signed.
By default, or if a name is prefixed with a &#39;*&#39;, a case insensitive
substring match is used. If a name is prefixed with a &#39;=&#39; a case
sensitive exact match is done.

The command <strong>–quick-lsign-key</strong> marks the signatures as
non-exportable. If such a non-exportable signature already exists the
<strong>–quick-sign-key</strong> turns it into a exportable signature. If you need
to update an existing signature, for example to add or change notation
data, you need to use the option <strong>–force-sign-key</strong>.

This command uses reasonable defaults and thus does not provide the
full flexibility of the &#34;sign&#34; subcommand from <strong>–edit-key</strong>. Its
intended use is to help unattended key signing by utilizing a list of
verified fingerprints.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–quick-add-uid <em>user-id</em> <em>new-user-id</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>This command adds a new
user id to an existing key. In contrast to the interactive sub-command
<strong>adduid</strong> of <strong>–edit-key</strong> the <em>new-user-id</em> is added verbatim with only
leading and trailing white space removed, it is expected to be UTF-8
encoded, and no checks on its form are applied.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–quick-revoke-uid <em>user-id</em> <em>user-id-to-revoke</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>This command
revokes a user ID on an existing key. It cannot be used to revoke the
last user ID on key (some non-revoked user ID must remain), with
revocation reason ``User ID is no longer valid&#39;&#39;. If you want to
specify a different revocation reason, or to supply supplementary
revocation text, you should use the interactive sub-command <strong>revuid</strong>
of <strong>–edit-key</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–quick-revoke-sig <em>fpr</em> <em>signing-fpr</em> [/names/]</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This command
revokes the key signatures made by <em>signing-fpr</em> from the key
specified by the fingerprint <em>fpr</em>. With <em>names</em> given only the
signatures on user ids of the key matching any of the given names are
affected (see <strong>–quick-sign-key</strong>). If a revocation already exists a
notice is printed instead of creating a new revocation; no error is
returned in this case. Note that key signature revocations may be
superseded by a newer key signature and in turn again revoked.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–quick-set-primary-uid <em>user-id</em> <em>primary-user-id</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>This command
sets or updates the primary user ID flag on an existing key. <em>user-id</em>
specifies the key and <em>primary-user-id</em> the user ID which shall be
flagged as the primary user ID. The primary user ID flag is removed
from all other user ids and the timestamp of all affected
self-signatures is set one second ahead.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–quick-update-pref <em>user-id</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>This command updates the preference
list of the key to the current default value (either built-in or set
via <strong>–default-preference-list</strong>). This is the unattended version of of
using &#34;setpref&#34; in the <strong>–key-edit</strong> menu without giving a list. Note
that you can show the preferences in a key listing by using
<strong>–list-options show-pref</strong> or <strong>–list-options</strong> show-pref-verbose. You
should also re-distribute updated keys to your peers.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
<strong>–default-key <em>name</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use <em>name</em> as the default key to sign with.
It is suggested to use a fingerprint or at least a long keyID for
<em>name</em>. If this option is not used, the default key is the first key
found in the secret keyring. Note that <strong>-u</strong> or <strong>–local-user</strong>
overrides this option. This option may be given multiple times. In
this case, the last key for which a secret key is available is used.
If there is no secret key available for any of the specified values,
GnuPG will not emit an error message but continue as if this option
wasn&#39;t given.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–default-recipient <em>name</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use <em>name</em> as default recipient if
option <strong>–recipient</strong> is not used and don&#39;t ask if this is a valid one.

<em>name</em>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–default-recipient-self</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use the default key as default recipient
if option <strong>–recipient</strong> is not used and don&#39;t ask if this is a valid
one. The default key is the first one from the secret keyring or the
one set with <strong>–default-key</strong>.</dd>

<dd><strong>–batch</strong><br>
<strong>–no-batch</strong> :: Use batch mode. Never ask, do not allow interactive
commands. <strong>–no-batch</strong> disables this option. Note that even with a
filename given on the command line, gpg might still need to read from
STDIN (in particular if gpg figures that the input is a detached
signature and no data file has been specified). Thus if you do not
want to feed data via STDIN, you should connect STDIN to
‘//dev/null/&#39;.

It is highly recommended to use this option along with the options
<strong>–status-fd</strong> and <strong>–with-colons</strong> for any unattended use of <strong>gpg</strong>.
Should not be used in an option file.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-tty</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Make sure that the TTY (terminal) is never used for any

<ul>
<li><strong>–enable-large-rsa</strong><br>
<strong>–disable-large-rsa</strong> :: With –generate-key and –batch, enable the
creation of RSA secret keys as large as 8192 bit. Note: 8192 bit is
more than is generally recommended. These large keys don&#39;t
significantly improve security, but they are more expensive to use,
and their signatures and certifications are larger. This option is
only available if the binary was build with large-secmem support.</li>
<li><strong>–enable-dsa2</strong><br>
<strong>–disable-dsa2</strong> :: Enable hash truncation for all DSA keys even for
old DSA Keys up to 1024 bit. This is also the default with
<strong>–openpgp</strong>. Note that older versions of GnuPG also required this flag
to allow the generation of DSA larger than 1024 bit.</li>
<li><strong>–photo-viewer <em>string</em></strong> :: This is the command line that should be
run to view a photo ID. &#34;%i&#34; will be expanded to a filename containing
the photo. &#34;%I&#34; does the same, except the file will not be deleted
once the viewer exits. Other flags are &#34;%k&#34; for the key ID, &#34;%K&#34; for
the long key ID, &#34;%f&#34; for the key fingerprint, &#34;%t&#34; for the extension
of the image type (e.g. &#34;jpg&#34;), &#34;%T&#34; for the MIME type of the image
(e.g. &#34;image/jpeg&#34;), &#34;%v&#34; for the single-character calculated validity
of the image being viewed (e.g. &#34;f&#34;), &#34;%V&#34; for the calculated validity
as a string (e.g. &#34;full&#34;), &#34;%U&#34; for a base32 encoded hash of the user
ID, and &#34;%%&#34; for an actual percent sign. If neither %i or %I are
present, then the photo will be supplied to the viewer on standard
input.

On Unix the default viewer is <strong>xloadimage -fork -quiet -title &#39;KeyID
0x%k&#39; STDIN</strong> with a fallback to <strong>display -title &#39;KeyID 0x%k&#39; %i</strong> and
finally to <strong>xdg-open %i</strong>. On Windows <strong>!ShellExecute 400 %i</strong> is used;
here the command is a meta command to use that API call followed by a
wait time in milliseconds which is used to give the viewer time to
read the temporary image file before gpg deletes it again. Note that
if your image viewer program is not secure, then executing it from gpg
does not make it secure.</li>
<li><strong>–exec-path <em>string</em></strong> :: Sets a list of directories to search for
photo viewers If not provided photo viewers use the <strong>PATH</strong> environment
variable.</li>
<li><strong>–keyring <em>file</em></strong> :: Add <em>file</em> to the current list of keyrings. If
<em>file</em> begins with a tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the
$HOME directory. If the filename does not contain a slash, it is
assumed to be in the GnuPG home directory (&#34;~/.gnupg&#34; unless
*--homedir* or $GNUPGHOME is used).

Note that this adds a keyring to the current list. If the intent is to
use the specified keyring alone, use <strong>–keyring</strong> along with
<strong>–no-default-keyring</strong>.

If the option <strong>–no-keyring</strong> has been used no keyrings will be used at
all.

Note that if the option <strong>use-keyboxd</strong> is enabled in ‘/common.conf/&#39;,
no keyrings are used at all and keys are all maintained by the keyboxd
process in its own database.</li>
<li><strong>–primary-keyring <em>file</em></strong> :: This is a varian of <strong>–keyring</strong> and
designates <em>file</em> as the primary public keyring. This means that newly
imported keys (via <strong>–import</strong> or keyserver <strong>–recv-from</strong>) will go to
this keyring.</li>
<li><strong>–secret-keyring <em>file</em></strong> :: This is an obsolete option and ignored.
All secret keys are stored in the ‘/private-keys-v1.d/&#39; directory
below the GnuPG home directory.</li>
<li><strong>–trustdb-name <em>file</em></strong> :: Use <em>file</em> instead of the default trustdb.
If <em>file</em> begins with a tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the
$HOME directory. If the filename does not contain a slash, it is
assumed to be in the GnuPG home directory (‘/~/.gnupg/&#39; if *--homedir*
or $GNUPGHOME is not used).</li>
<li><strong>–homedir <em>dir</em></strong> :: Set the name of the home directory to <em>dir</em>. If
this option is not used, the home directory defaults to ‘/~/.gnupg/&#39;.
It is only recognized when given on the command line. It also
overrides any home directory stated through the environment variable
‘/GNUPGHOME/&#39; or (on Windows systems) by means of the Registry entry
<em>HKCU§oftware\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir</em>.

On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable
application. In this case only this command line option is considered,
all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.</li>
<li><strong>–display-charset <em>name</em></strong> :: Set the name of the native character
set. This is used to convert some informational strings like user IDs
to the proper UTF-8 encoding. Note that this has nothing to do with
the character set of data to be encrypted or signed; GnuPG does not
recode user-supplied data. If this option is not used, the default
character set is determined from the current locale. A verbosity level
of 3 shows the chosen set. This option should not be used on Windows.
Valid values for <em>name</em> are:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<dl>

</dt>
<dd>This is the Latin 1 set.</dd>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>–utf8-strings</strong><br>
<strong>–no-utf8-strings</strong> :: Assume that command line arguments are given as
UTF-8 strings. The default (<strong>–no-utf8-strings</strong>) is to assume that
arguments are encoded in the character set as specified by
<strong>–display-charset</strong>. These options affect all following arguments.
Both options may be used multiple times. This option should not be
used in an option file.

This option has no effect on Windows. There the internal used UTF-8
encoding is translated for console input and output. The command line
arguments are expected as Unicode and translated to UTF-8. Thus when
calling this program from another, make sure to use the Unicode
version of CreateProcess.</li>
<li><strong>–options <em>file</em></strong> :: Read options from <em>file</em> and do not try to read
them from the default options file in the homedir (see <strong>–homedir</strong>).
This option is ignored if used in an options file.</li>
<li><strong>–no-options</strong> :: Shortcut for <strong>–options /dev/null</strong>. This option is
detected before an attempt to open an option file. Using this option
will also prevent the creation of a ‘/~/.gnupg/&#39; homedir.</li>
<li><strong>-z <em>n</em></strong><br>
<strong>–compress-level <em>n</em></strong><br>
<strong>–bzip2-compress-level <em>n</em></strong><br>
<strong>–no-compress</strong> :: Set compression level to <em>n</em> for the ZIP and ZLIB
compression algorithms. The default is to use the default compression
level of zlib (normally 6). <strong>–bzip2-compress-level</strong> sets the
compression level for the BZIP2 compression algorithm (defaulting to 6
as well). This is a different option from <strong>–compress-level</strong> since
BZIP2 uses a significant amount of memory for each additional
compression level.

Option <strong>-z</strong> sets both. A value of 0 for <em>n</em> disables compression. A
value of -1 forces compression using the default level. Option
<strong>–no-compress</strong> is identical to <strong>-z0</strong>.

Except for the <strong>–store</strong> command compression is always used unless
<strong>gpg</strong> detects that the input is already compressed. To inhibit the use
of compression use <strong>-z0</strong> or <strong>–no-compress</strong>; to force compression use
<strong>-z-1</strong> or option <strong>z</strong> with another compression level than the default
as indicated by -1. Note that this overriding of the default deection
works only with <strong>z</strong> and not with the long variant of this option.</li>
<li><strong>–bzip2-decompress-lowmem</strong> :: Use a different decompression method
for BZIP2 compressed files. This alternate method uses a bit more than
half the memory, but also runs at half the speed. This is useful under
extreme low memory circumstances when the file was originally
compressed at a high <strong>–bzip2-compress-level</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>–mangle-dos-filenames</strong><br>
<strong>–no-mangle-dos-filenames</strong> :: Older version of Windows cannot handle
filenames with more than one dot. <strong>–mangle-dos-filenames</strong> causes
GnuPG to replace (rather than add to) the extension of an output
filename to avoid this problem. This option is off by default and has
no effect on non-Windows platforms.</li>
<li><strong>–ask-cert-level</strong><br>
<strong>–no-ask-cert-level</strong> :: When making a key signature, prompt for a
certification level. If this option is not specified, the
certification level used is set via <strong>–default-cert-level</strong>. See
<strong>–default-cert-level</strong> for information on the specific levels and how
they are used. <strong>–no-ask-cert-level</strong> disables this option. This option
defaults to no.</li>
<li><strong>–default-cert-level <em>n</em></strong> :: The default to use for the check level
when signing a key.

0 means you make no particular claim as to how carefully you verified
the key.

1 means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims to own
it but you could not, or did not verify the key at all. This is useful
for a &#34;persona&#34; verification, where you sign the key of a pseudonymous
user.

2 means you did casual verification of the key. For example, this
could mean that you verified the key fingerprint and checked the user
ID on the key against a photo ID.

3 means you did extensive verification of the key. For example, this
could mean that you verified the key fingerprint with the owner of the
key in person, and that you checked, by means of a hard to forge
document with a photo ID (such as a passport) that the name of the key
owner matches the name in the user ID on the key, and finally that you
verified (by exchange of email) that the email address on the key
belongs to the key owner.

Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3 are just that:
examples. In the end, it is up to you to decide just what &#34;casual&#34; and
&#34;extensive&#34; mean to you.

This option defaults to 0 (no particular claim).</li>
<li><strong>–min-cert-level</strong> :: When building the trust database, treat any
signatures with a certification level below this as invalid. Defaults
to 2, which disregards level 1 signatures. Note that level 0 &#34;no
particular claim&#34; signatures are always accepted.</li>
<li><strong>–trusted-key <em>long</em> key ID or fingerprint</strong> :: Assume that the
specified key (which should be given as fingerprint) is as trustworthy
as one of your own secret keys. This option is useful if you don&#39;t
want to keep your secret keys (or one of them) online but still want
to be able to check the validity of a given recipient&#39;s or signator&#39;s
key. If the given key is not locally available but an LDAP keyserver
is configured the missing key is imported from that server. The value
&#34;none&#34; is explicitly allowed to distinguish between the use of any
trusted-key option and no use of this option at all (e.g. due to the
<strong>–no-options</strong> option).</li>
<li><strong>–add-desig-revoker [sensitive:]/fingerprint/</strong> :: Add the key
specified by <em>fingerprint</em> as a designated revoker to newly created
keys. If the fingerprint is prefixed with the keyword ``sensitive:&#39;&#39;
that info is normally not exported wit the key. This option may be
given several time to add more than one designated revoker. If the
keyword ``clear&#39;&#39; is used instead of a fingerprint, all designated
options previously encountered are discarded. Designated revokers are
marked on the key as non-revocable. Note that a designated revoker
specified using a parameter file will also be added to the key.</li>
<li><strong>–trust-model {pgp|classic|tofu|tofu+pgp|direct|always|auto}</strong> :: Set
what trust model GnuPG should follow. The models are:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>pgp</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is the Web of Trust combined with trust signatures as
used in PGP 5.x and later. This is the default trust model when
creating a new trust database.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>classic</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is the standard Web of Trust as introduced by PGP 2.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>tofu</strong>
</dt>
<dd>TOFU stands for Trust On First Use. In this experimental
trust model, the first time a key is seen, it is memorized. If later
another key with a user id with the same email address is seen, both
keys are marked as suspect. In that case, the next time either is
used, a warning is displayed describing the conflict, why it might
have occurred (either the user generated a new key and failed to cross
sign the old and new keys, the key is forgery, or a man-in-the-middle
attack is being attempted), and the user is prompted to manually
confirm the validity of the key in question.

Because a potential attacker is able to control the email address and
thereby circumvent the conflict detection algorithm by using an email
address that is similar in appearance to a trusted email address,
whenever a message is verified, statistics about the number of
messages signed with the key are shown. In this way, a user can easily
identify attacks using fake keys for regular correspondents.

When compared with the Web of Trust, TOFU offers significantly weaker
security guarantees. In particular, TOFU only helps ensure consistency
(that is, that the binding between a key and email address doesn&#39;t
change). A major advantage of TOFU is that it requires little
maintenance to use correctly. To use the web of trust properly, you
need to actively sign keys and mark users as trusted introducers. This
is a time-consuming process and anecdotal evidence suggests that even
security-conscious users rarely take the time to do this thoroughly
and instead rely on an ad-hoc TOFU process.

In the TOFU model, policies are associated with bindings between keys
and email addresses (which are extracted from user ids and
normalized). There are five policies, which can be set manually using
the <strong>–tofu-policy</strong> option. The default policy can be set using the
<strong>–tofu-default-policy</strong> option.

The TOFU policies are: <strong>auto</strong>, <strong>good</strong>, <strong>unknown</strong>, <strong>bad</strong> and <strong>ask</strong>. The
<strong>auto</strong> policy is used by default (unless overridden by
<strong>–tofu-default-policy</strong>) and marks a binding as marginally trusted.
The <strong>good</strong>, <strong>unknown</strong> and <strong>bad</strong> policies mark a binding as fully
trusted, as having unknown trust or as having trust never,
respectively. The <strong>unknown</strong> policy is useful for just using TOFU to
detect conflicts, but to never assign positive trust to a binding. The
final policy, <strong>ask</strong> prompts the user to indicate the binding&#39;s trust.
If batch mode is enabled (or input is inappropriate in the context),
then the user is not prompted and the <strong>undefined</strong> trust level is
returned.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>tofu+pgp</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This experimental trust model combines TOFU with the Web
of Trust. This is done by computing the trust level for each model and
then taking the maximum trust level where the trust levels are ordered
as follows: <strong>unknown &lt; undefined &lt; marginal &lt; fully &lt; ultimate &lt;
expired &lt;</strong> never.

By setting <strong>–tofu-default-policy=unknown</strong>, this model can be used to
implement the web of trust with TOFU&#39;s conflict detection algorithm,
but without its assignment of positive trust values, which some
security-conscious users don&#39;t like.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>direct</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Key validity is set directly by the user and not
calculated via the Web of Trust. This model is solely based on the key
and does not distinguish user IDs. Note that when changing to another
trust model the trust values assigned to a key are transformed into
ownertrust values, which also indicate how you trust the owner of the
key to sign other keys.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>always</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Skip key validation and assume that used keys are always
fully valid. You generally won&#39;t use this unless you are using some
external validation scheme. This option also suppresses the
&#34;[uncertain]&#34; tag printed with signature checks when there is no
evidence that the user ID is bound to the key. Note that this trust
model still does not allow the use of expired, revoked, or disabled
keys.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>auto</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Select the trust model depending on whatever the internal
trust database says. This is the default model if such a database
already exists. Note that a tofu trust model is not considered here
and must be enabled explicitly.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
<strong>–always-trust</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Identical to <strong>–trust-model always</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–assert-signer <em>fpr_or_file</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option checks whether at least
one valid signature on a file has been made with the specified key.
The key is either specified as a fingerprint or a file listing
fingerprints. The fingerprint must be given or listed in compact
format (no colons or spaces in between). This option can be given
multiple times and each fingerprint is checked against the signing key
as well as the corresponding primary key. If <em>fpr_or_file</em> specifies a
file, empty lines are ignored as well as all lines starting with a
hash sign. With this option gpg is guaranteed to return with an exit
code of 0 if and only if a signature has been encountered, is valid,
and the key matches one of the fingerprints given by this option.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–assert-pubkey-algo <em>algolist</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>During data signature
verification this options checks whether the used public key algorithm
matches the algorithms given by <em>algolist</em>. This option can be given
multiple times to concatenate more algorithms to the list; the
delimiter of the list are either commas or spaces.

The algorithm names given in the list may either be verbatim names
like &#34;ed25519&#34; with an optional leading single equal sign, or being
prefixed with &#34;&gt;&#34;, &#34;&gt;=&#34;, &#34;&lt;=&#34;, or &#34;&lt;&#34;. That prefix operator is applied
to the number part of the algorithm name; for example 2048 in
&#34;rsa2048&#34; or 384 in &#34;brainpoolP384r1&#34;. If the the leading non-digits
in the name matches, the prefix operator is used to compare the number
part, a trailing suffix is ignored in this case. For example an
algorithm list &#34;&gt;rsa3000, &gt;=brainpool384r1, =ed25519&#34; allows RSA
signatures with more that 3000 bits, Brainpool curves 384 and 512, and
the ed25519 algorithm.

With this option gpg (and also gpgv) is guaranteed to return with an
exit code of 0 if and only if all valid signatures on data are made
using a matching algorithm from the given list.</dd>

<dd><strong>–auto-key-locate <em>mechanisms</em></strong><br>
<strong>–no-auto-key-locate</strong> :: GnuPG can automatically locate and retrieve
keys as needed using this option. This happens when encrypting to an
email address (in the &#34;user@example.com&#34; form), and there are no
&#34;user@example.com&#34; keys on the local keyring. This option takes any
number of the mechanisms listed below, in the order they are to be

<ul>
<li><strong>–auto-key-import</strong><br>
<strong>–no-auto-key-import</strong> :: This is an offline mechanism to get a
missing key for signature verification and for later encryption to
this key. If this option is enabled and a signature includes an
embedded key, that key is used to verify the signature and on
verification success the key is imported. The default is
<strong>–no-auto-key-import</strong>.

On the sender (signing) site the option <strong>–include-key-block</strong> needs to
be used to put the public part of the signing key as “Key Block
subpacket” into the signature.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>–auto-key-retrieve</strong><br>
<strong>–no-auto-key-retrieve</strong> :: These options enable or disable the
automatic retrieving of keys from a keyserver when verifying
signatures made by keys that are not on the local keyring. The default
is <strong>–no-auto-key-retrieve</strong>.</p>
<p>
The order of methods tried to lookup the key is:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the option <strong>–auto-key-import</strong> is set and the signatures</li>
</ol>
<p>includes an embedded key, that key is used to verify the signature and
on verification success that key is imported.</p>
<ol>
<li>If a preferred keyserver is specified in the signature and the</li>
</ol>
<p>option <strong>honor-keyserver-url</strong> is active (which is not the default),
that keyserver is tried. Note that the creator of the signature uses
the option <strong>–sig-keyserver-url</strong> to specify the preferred keyserver
for data signatures.</p>
<ol>
<li>If the signature has the Signer&#39;s UID set (e.g. using <strong>–sender</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>while creating the signature) a Web Key Directory (WKD) lookup is
done. This is the default configuration but can be disabled by
removing WKD from the auto-key-locate list or by using the option
<strong>–disable-signer-uid</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>If any keyserver is configured and the Issuer Fingerprint is part</li>
</ol>
<p>of the signature (since GnuPG 2.1.16), the configured keyservers are
tried.</p>
<p>
Note that this option makes a &#34;web bug&#34; like behavior possible.
Keyserver or Web Key Directory operators can see which keys you
request, so by sending you a message signed by a brand new key (which
you naturally will not have on your local keyring), the operator can
tell both your IP address and the time when you verified the
signature.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>–keyid-format {none|short|0xshort|long|0xlong}</strong> :: Select how to
display key IDs. &#34;none&#34; does not show the key ID at all but shows the
fingerprint in a separate line. &#34;short&#34; is the traditional 8-character
key ID. &#34;long&#34; is the more accurate (but less convenient) 16-character
key ID. Add an &#34;0x&#34; to either to include an &#34;0x&#34; at the beginning of
the key ID, as in 0x99242560. Note that this option is ignored if the
option <strong>–with-colons</strong> is used.</li>
<li><strong>–keyserver <em>name</em></strong> :: This option is deprecated - please use the
<strong>–keyserver</strong> in ‘/dirmngr.conf/&#39; instead.

Use <em>name</em> as your keyserver. This is the server that
<strong>–receive-keys</strong>, <strong>–send-keys</strong>, and <strong>–search-keys</strong> will communicate
with to receive keys from, send keys to, and search for keys on. The
format of the <em>name</em> is a URI: `scheme:[//]keyservername[:port]&#39; The
scheme is the type of keyserver: &#34;hkp&#34;<em>&#34;hkps&#34; for the HTTP (or
compatible) keyservers or &#34;ldap&#34;</em>&#34;ldaps&#34; for the LDAP keyservers. Note
that your particular installation of GnuPG may have other keyserver
types available as well. Keyserver schemes are case-insensitive.

Most keyservers synchronize with each other, so there is generally no
need to send keys to more than one server. The keyserver
<strong>hkp://keys.gnupg.net</strong> uses round robin DNS to give a different
keyserver each time you use it.</li>
<li><strong>–keyserver-options {<em>name/=/value</em>}</strong> :: This is a space or comma
delimited string that gives options for the keyserver. Options can be
prefixed with a `no-&#39; to give the opposite meaning. Valid
import-options or export-options may be used here as well to apply to
importing (<strong>–recv-key</strong>) or exporting (<strong>–send-key</strong>) a key from a
keyserver. While not all options are available for all keyserver
types, some common options are:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>include-revoked</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When searching for a key with <strong>–search-keys</strong>,
include keys that are marked on the keyserver as revoked. Note that
not all keyservers differentiate between revoked and unrevoked keys,
and for such keyservers this option is meaningless. Note also that
most keyservers do not have cryptographic verification of key
revocations, and so turning this option off may result in skipping
keys that are incorrectly marked as revoked.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>include-disabled</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When searching for a key with <strong>–search-keys</strong>,
include keys that are marked on the keyserver as disabled. Note that
this option is not used with HKP keyservers.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>auto-key-retrieve</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is an obsolete alias for the option
<strong>auto-key-retrieve</strong>. Please do not use it; it will be removed in
future versions..</dd>
<dt>
<strong>honor-keyserver-url</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When using <strong>–refresh-keys</strong>, if the key in
question has a preferred keyserver URL, then use that preferred
keyserver to refresh the key from. In addition, if auto-key-retrieve
is set, and the signature being verified has a preferred keyserver
URL, then use that preferred keyserver to fetch the key from. Note
that this option introduces a &#34;web bug&#34;: The creator of the key can
see when the keys is refreshed. Thus this option is not enabled by
default.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>include-subkeys</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When receiving a key, include subkeys as
potential targets. Note that this option is not used with HKP
keyservers, as they do not support retrieving keys by subkey id.</dd>

<p>
The default list of options is: &#34;self-sigs-only, import-clean,
repair-keys, repair-pks-subkey-bug, export-attributes&#34;. However, if the
actual used source is an LDAP server &#34;no-self-sigs-only&#34; is assumed

<dt>
<strong>–max-cert-depth <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Maximum depth of a certification chain
(default is 5).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-sig-cache</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Do not cache the verification status of key
signatures. Caching gives a much better performance in key listings.
However, if you suspect that your public keyring is not safe against
write modifications, you can use this option to disable the caching.
It probably does not make sense to disable it because all kind of
damage can be done if someone else has write access to your public
keyring.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–auto-check-trustdb</strong><br>
<strong>–no-auto-check-trustdb</strong> :: If GnuPG feels that its information about
the Web of Trust has to be updated, it automatically runs the
<strong>–check-trustdb</strong> command internally. This may be a time consuming
process. <strong>–no-auto-check-trustdb</strong> disables this option.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–use-agent</strong><br>
<strong>–no-use-agent</strong> :: This is dummy option. <strong>gpg</strong> always requires the
agent.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–gpg-agent-info</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is dummy option. It has no effect when used
with <strong>gpg</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–agent-program <em>file</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specify an agent program to be used for
secret key operations. The default value is determined by running
<strong>gpgconf</strong> with the option <strong>–list-dirs</strong>. Note that the pipe symbol
(<strong>|</strong>) is used for a regression test suite hack and may thus not be
used in the file name.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–dirmngr-program <em>file</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specify a dirmngr program to be used for
keyserver access. The default value is
‘//nix/store/3740w49c73r712d94hl2wx7q3a39b3b0-gnupg-2.4.5/bin/dirmngr/&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–disable-dirmngr</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Entirely disable the use of the Dirmngr.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-autostart</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Do not start the gpg-agent or the dirmngr if it
has not yet been started and its service is required. This option is
mostly useful on machines where the connection to gpg-agent has been
redirected to another machines. If dirmngr is required on the remote
machine, it may be started manually using <strong>gpgconf –launch dirmngr</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–lock-once</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Lock the databases the first time a lock is requested
and do not release the lock until the process terminates.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–lock-multiple</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Release the locks every time a lock is no longer
needed. Use this to override a previous <strong>–lock-once</strong> from a config
file.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–lock-never</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Disable locking entirely. This option should be used
only in very special environments, where it can be assured that only
one process is accessing those files. A bootable floppy with a
stand-alone encryption system will probably use this. Improper usage
of this option may lead to data and key corruption.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–exit-on-status-write-error</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option will cause write errors
on the status FD to immediately terminate the process. That should in
fact be the default but it never worked this way and thus we need an
option to enable this, so that the change won&#39;t break applications
which close their end of a status fd connected pipe too early. Using
this option along with <strong>–enable-progress-filter</strong> may be used to
cleanly cancel long running gpg operations.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–limit-card-insert-tries <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>With <em>n</em> greater than 0 the number
of prompts asking to insert a smartcard gets limited to N-1. Thus with
a value of 1 gpg won&#39;t at all ask to insert a card if none has been
inserted at startup. This option is useful in the configuration file
in case an application does not know about the smartcard support and
waits ad infinitum for an inserted card.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-random-seed-file</strong>
</dt>
<dd>GnuPG uses a file to store its internal
random pool over invocations. This makes random generation faster;
however sometimes write operations are not desired. This option can be
used to achieve that with the cost of slower random generation.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-greeting</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Suppress the initial copyright message.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-secmem-warning</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Suppress the warning about &#34;using insecure
memory&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-permission-warning</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Suppress the warning about unsafe file
and home directory (<strong>–homedir</strong>) permissions. Note that the permission
checks that GnuPG performs are not intended to be authoritative, but
rather they simply warn about certain common permission problems. Do
not assume that the lack of a warning means that your system is
secure.

Note that the warning for unsafe <strong>–homedir</strong> permissions cannot be
suppressed in the gpg.conf file, as this would allow an attacker to
place an unsafe gpg.conf file in place, and use this file to suppress
warnings about itself. The <strong>–homedir</strong> permissions warning may only be
suppressed on the command line.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–require-secmem</strong><br>
<strong>–no-require-secmem</strong> :: Refuse to run if GnuPG cannot get secure
memory. Defaults to no (i.e. run, but give a warning).</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–require-cross-certification</strong><br>
<strong>–no-require-cross-certification</strong> :: When verifying a signature made
from a subkey, ensure that the cross certification &#34;back signature&#34; on
the subkey is present and valid. This protects against a subtle attack
against subkeys that can sign. Defaults to
<strong>–require-cross-certification</strong> for <strong>gpg</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–expert</strong><br>
<strong>–no-expert</strong> :: Allow the user to do certain nonsensical or &#34;silly&#34;
things like signing an expired or revoked key, or certain potentially
incompatible things like generating unusual key types. This also
disables certain warning messages about potentially incompatible
actions. As the name implies, this option is for experts only. If you
don&#39;t fully understand the implications of what it allows you to do,
leave this off. <strong>–no-expert</strong> disables this option.</dd>

<ul>
<li><strong>–recipient <em>name</em></strong><br>
<strong>-r</strong> :: Encrypt for user id <em>name</em>. If this option or
<strong>–hidden-recipient</strong> is not specified, GnuPG asks for the user-id
unless <strong>–default-recipient</strong> is given.</li>
<li><strong>–hidden-recipient <em>name</em></strong><br>
<strong>-R</strong> :: Encrypt for user ID <em>name</em>, but hide the key ID of this user&#39;s
key. This option helps to hide the receiver of the message and is a
limited countermeasure against traffic analysis. If this option or
<strong>–recipient</strong> is not specified, GnuPG asks for the user ID unless
<strong>–default-recipient</strong> is given.</li>
<li><strong>–recipient-file <em>file</em></strong><br>
<strong>-f</strong> :: This option is similar to <strong>–recipient</strong> except that it
encrypts to a key stored in the given file. <em>file</em> must be the name of
a file containing exactly one key. <strong>gpg</strong> assumes that the key in this
file is fully valid.</li>
<li><strong>–hidden-recipient-file <em>file</em></strong><br>
<strong>-F</strong> :: This option is similar to <strong>–hidden-recipient</strong> except that it
encrypts to a key stored in the given file. <em>file</em> must be the name of
a file containing exactly one key. <strong>gpg</strong> assumes that the key in this
file is fully valid.</li>
<li><strong>–encrypt-to <em>name</em></strong> :: Same as <strong>–recipient</strong> but this one is
intended for use in the options file and may be used with your own
user-id as an &#34;encrypt-to-self&#34;. It is suggested to use a fingerprint
or at least a long keyID for <em>name</em>. These keys are only used when
there are other recipients given either by use of <strong>–recipient</strong> or by
the asked user id. No trust checking is performed for these user ids
and even disabled keys can be used.</li>
<li><strong>–hidden-encrypt-to <em>name</em></strong> :: Same as <strong>–hidden-recipient</strong> but this
one is intended for use in the options file and may be used with your
own user-id as a hidden &#34;encrypt-to-self&#34;. It is suggested to use a
fingerprint or at least a long keyID for <em>name</em>. These keys are only
used when there are other recipients given either by use of
<strong>–recipient</strong> or by the asked user id. No trust checking is performed
for these user ids and even disabled keys can be used.</li>
<li><strong>–no-encrypt-to</strong> :: Disable the use of all <strong>–encrypt-to</strong> and
<strong>–hidden-encrypt-to</strong> keys.</li>
<li><strong>–group {<em>name/=/value</em>}</strong> :: Sets up a named group, which is similar
to aliases in email programs. Any time the group name is a recipient
(<strong>-r</strong> or <strong>–recipient</strong>), it will be expanded to the values specified.
Multiple groups with the same name are automatically merged into a
single group.

The values are <strong>key IDs</strong> or fingerprints, but any key description is
accepted. Note that a value with spaces in it will be treated as two
different values. Note also there is only one level of expansion —
you cannot make an group that points to another group. When used from
the command line, it may be necessary to quote the argument to this
option to prevent the shell from treating it as multiple arguments.</li>
<li><strong>–ungroup <em>name</em></strong> :: Remove a given entry from the <strong>–group</strong> list.</li>
<li><strong>–no-groups</strong> :: Remove all entries from the <strong>–group</strong> list.</li>
<li><strong>–local-user <em>name</em></strong><br>
<strong>-u</strong> :: Use <em>name</em> as the key to sign with. Note that this option
overrides <strong>–default-key</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>–sender <em>mbox</em></strong> :: This option has two purposes. <em>mbox</em> must either
be a complete user ID containing a proper mail address or just a plain
mail address. The option can be given multiple times.

When creating a signature this option tells gpg the signing key&#39;s user
id used to make the signature and embeds that user ID into the created
signature (using OpenPGP&#39;s ``Signer&#39;s User ID&#39;&#39; subpacket). If the
option is given multiple times a suitable user ID is picked. However,
if the signing key was specified directly by using a mail address
(i.e. not by using a fingerprint or key ID) this option is used and
the mail address is embedded in the created signature.

When verifying a signature <em>mbox</em> is used to restrict the information
printed by the TOFU code to matching user IDs. If the option is used
and the signature contains a ``Signer&#39;s User ID&#39;&#39; subpacket that
information is is also used to restrict the printed information. Note
that GnuPG considers only the mail address part of a User ID.

If this option or the said subpacket is available the TRUST lines as
printed by option <strong>status-fd</strong> correspond to the corresponding User ID;
if no User ID is known the TRUST lines are computed directly on the
key and do not give any information about the User ID. In the latter
case it his highly recommended to scripts and other frontends to
evaluate the VALIDSIG line, retrieve the key and print all User IDs
along with their validity (trust) information.</li>
<li><strong>–try-secret-key <em>name</em></strong> :: For hidden recipients GPG needs to know
the keys to use for trial decryption. The key set with <strong>–default-key</strong>
is always tried first, but this is often not sufficient. This option
allows setting more keys to be used for trial decryption. Although any
valid user-id specification may be used for <em>name</em> it makes sense to
use at least the long keyid to avoid ambiguities. Note that gpg-agent
might pop up a pinentry for a lot keys to do the trial decryption. If
you want to stop all further trial decryption you may use close-window
button instead of the cancel button.</li>
<li><strong>–try-all-secrets</strong> :: Don&#39;t look at the key ID as stored in the
message but try all secret keys in turn to find the right decryption
key. This option forces the behaviour as used by anonymous recipients
(created by using <strong>–throw-keyids</strong> or <strong>–hidden-recipient</strong>) and might
come handy in case where an encrypted message contains a bogus key ID.</li>
<li><strong>–skip-hidden-recipients</strong><br>
<strong>–no-skip-hidden-recipients</strong> :: During decryption skip all anonymous
recipients. This option helps in the case that people use the hidden
recipients feature to hide their own encrypt-to key from others. If
one has many secret keys this may lead to a major annoyance because
all keys are tried in turn to decrypt something which was not really
intended for it. The drawback of this option is that it is currently
not possible to decrypt a message which includes real anonymous
recipients.</li>

<li><strong>–output <em>file</em></strong><br>
<strong>-o <em>file</em></strong> :: Write output to <em>file</em>. To write to stdout use <strong>-</strong> as
the filename.</li>
<li><strong>–max-output <em>n</em></strong> :: This option sets a limit on the number of bytes
that will be generated when processing a file. Since OpenPGP supports
various levels of compression, it is possible that the plaintext of a
given message may be significantly larger than the original OpenPGP
message. While GnuPG works properly with such messages, there is often
a desire to set a maximum file size that will be generated before
processing is forced to stop by the OS limits. Defaults to 0, which
means &#34;no limit&#34;.</li>
<li><strong>–chunk-size <em>n</em></strong> :: The AEAD encryption mode encrypts the data in
chunks so that a receiving side can check for transmission errors or
tampering at the end of each chunk and does not need to delay this
until all data has been received. The used chunk size is 2^/n/ byte.
The lowest allowed value for <em>n</em> is 6 (64 byte) and the largest is the
default of 22 which creates chunks not larger than 4 MiB.</li>
<li><strong>–input-size-hint <em>n</em></strong> :: This option can be used to tell GPG the
size of the input data in bytes. <em>n</em> must be a positive base-10
number. This option is only useful if the input is not taken from a
file. GPG may use this hint to optimize its buffer allocation
strategy. It is also used by the <strong>–status-fd</strong> line ``PROGRESS&#39;&#39; to
provide a value for ``total&#39;&#39; if that is not available by other means.</li>
<li><strong>–key-origin <em>string</em>[,/url/]</strong> :: gpg can track the origin of a key.
Certain origins are implicitly known (e.g. keyserver, web key
directory) and set. For a standard import the origin of the keys
imported can be set with this option. To list the possible values use
&#34;help&#34; for <em>string</em>. Some origins can store an optional <em>url</em>
argument. That URL can appended to <em>string</em> after a comma.</li>
<li><strong>–import-options <em>parameters</em></strong> :: This is a space or comma delimited

<dd>Normally possible still existing ownertrust
values of a key are cleared if a key is imported. This is in general
desirable so that a formerly deleted key does not automatically gain

<dd>During import, attempt to repair the damage
caused by the PKS keyserver bug (pre version 0.9.6) that mangles keys
with multiple subkeys. Note that this cannot completely repair the
damaged key as some crucial data is removed by the keyserver, but it
does at least give you back one subkey. Defaults to no for regular
<strong>–import</strong> and to yes for keyserver <strong>–receive-keys</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>import-show</strong><br>
<strong>show-only</strong> :: Show a listing of the key as imported right before it
is stored. This can be combined with the option <strong>–dry-run</strong> to only
look at keys; the option <strong>show-only</strong> is a shortcut for this
combination. The command <strong>–show-keys</strong> is another shortcut for this.
Note that suffixes like &#39;#&#39; for &#34;sec&#34; and &#34;sbb&#34; lines may or may not
be printed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>import-export</strong>

to remove all invalid parts from a key without the need to store it.</dd>

<strong>import-clean</strong>
</dt>
<dd>After import, compact (remove all signatures except
the self-signature) any user IDs from the new key that are not usable.
Then, remove any signatures from the new key that are not usable. This

<dt>
<strong>self-sigs-only</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Accept only self-signatures while importing a key.
All other key signatures are skipped at an early import stage. This
option can be used with <strong>keyserver-options</strong> to mitigate attempts to
flood a key with bogus signatures from a keyserver. The drawback is
that all other valid key signatures, as required by the Web of Trust
are also not imported. Note that when using this option along with
import-clean it suppresses the final clean step after merging the
imported key into the existing key.</dd>

<strong>–export-options <em>parameters</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is a space or comma delimited
string that gives options for exporting keys. Options can be prepended
with a `no-&#39; to give the opposite meaning. The options are:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>export-local-sigs</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Allow exporting key signatures marked as
&#34;local&#34;. This is not generally useful unless a shared keyring scheme
is being used. Defaults to no.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>export-attributes</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Include attribute user IDs (photo IDs) while
exporting. Not including attribute user IDs is useful to export keys
that are going to be used by an OpenPGP program that does not accept
attribute user IDs. Defaults to yes.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>export-sensitive-revkeys</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Include designated revoker information
that was marked as &#34;sensitive&#34;. Defaults to no.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>backup</strong><br>
<strong>export-backup</strong> :: Export for use as a backup. The exported data
includes all data which is needed to restore the key or keys later
with GnuPG. The format is basically the OpenPGP format but enhanced
with GnuPG specific data. All other contradicting options are
overridden.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>export-clean</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Compact (remove all signatures from) user IDs on the
key being exported if the user IDs are not usable. Also, do not export
any signatures that are not usable. This includes signatures that were
issued by keys that are not present on the keyring. This option is the
same as running the <strong>–edit-key</strong> command &#34;clean&#34; before export except
that the local copy of the key is not modified. Defaults to no.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>export-minimal</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Export the smallest key possible. This removes all
signatures except the most recent self-signature on each user ID. This
option is the same as running the <strong>–edit-key</strong> command &#34;minimize&#34;
before export except that the local copy of the key is not modified.
Defaults to no.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>export-revocs</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Export only standalone revocation certificates of
the key. This option does not export revocations of 3rd party
certificate revocations.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>export-dane</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Instead of outputting the key material output OpenPGP
DANE records suitable to put into DNS zone files. An ORIGIN line is
printed before each record to allow diverting the records to the
corresponding zone file.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>mode1003</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Enable the use of a new secret key export format. This
format avoids the re-encryption as required with the current OpenPGP
format and also improves the security of the secret key if it has been
protected with a passphrase. Note that an unprotected key is exported
as-is and thus not secure; the general rule to convey secret keys in
an OpenPGP encrypted file still applies with this mode. Versions of
GnuPG before 2.4.0 are not able to import such a secret file.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>–with-colons</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print key listings delimited by colons. Note that
the output will be encoded in UTF-8 regardless of any
<strong>–display-charset</strong> setting. This format is useful when GnuPG is
called from scripts and other programs as it is easily machine parsed.
The details of this format are documented in the file ‘/doc/DETAILS/&#39;,
which is included in the GnuPG source distribution.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–fixed-list-mode</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Do not merge primary user ID and primary key in
<strong>–with-colon</strong> listing mode and print all timestamps as seconds since
1970-01-01. Since GnuPG 2.0.10, this mode is always used and thus this
option is obsolete; it does not harm to use it though.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–legacy-list-mode</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Revert to the pre-2.1 public key list mode.
This only affects the human readable output and not the machine
interface (i.e. <strong>–with-colons</strong>). Note that the legacy format does not
convey suitable information for elliptic curves.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–with-fingerprint</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Same as the command <strong>–fingerprint</strong> but
changes only the format of the output and may be used together with
another command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–with-subkey-fingerprint</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If a fingerprint is printed for the
primary key, this option forces printing of the fingerprint for all
subkeys. This could also be achieved by using the <strong>–with-fingerprint</strong>
twice but by using this option along with keyid-format &#34;none&#34; a
compact fingerprint is printed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–with-v5-fingerprint</strong>
</dt>
<dd>In a colon mode listing emit &#34;fp2&#34; lines
for version 4 OpenPGP keys having a v5 style fingerprint of the key.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–with-icao-spelling</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print the ICAO spelling of the fingerprint
in addition to the hex digits.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–with-keygrip</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Include the keygrip in the key listings. In
<strong>–with-colons</strong> mode this is implicitly enable for secret keys.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–with-key-origin</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Include the locally held information on the
origin and last update of a key in a key listing. In <strong>–with-colons</strong>
mode this is always printed. This data is currently experimental and
shall not be considered part of the stable API.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–with-wkd-hash</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print a Web Key Directory identifier along with
each user ID in key listings. This is an experimental feature and
semantics may change.</dd>

OpenPGP protocol specific options
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-3">
<ul>
<li><strong>–force-ocb</strong><br>
<strong>–force-aead</strong> :: Force the use of AEAD encryption over MDC
encryption. AEAD is a modern and faster way to do authenticated
encryption than the old MDC method. <strong>–force-aead</strong> is an alias and
deprecated. See also option <strong>–chunk-size</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>–force-mdc</strong><br>
<strong>–disable-mdc</strong> :: These options are obsolete and have no effect since
GnuPG 2.2.8. The MDC is always used unless the keys indicate that an
AEAD algorithm can be used in which case AEAD is used. But note: If
the creation of a legacy non-MDC message is exceptionally required,
the option <strong>–rfc2440</strong> allows for this.</li>
<li><strong>–disable-signer-uid</strong> :: By default the user ID of the signing key is
embedded in the data signature. As of now this is only done if the
signing key has been specified with <strong>local-user</strong> using a mail address,
or with <strong>sender</strong>. This information can be helpful for verifier to
locate the key; see option <strong>–auto-key-retrieve</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>–include-key-block</strong><br>
<strong>–no-include-key-block</strong> :: This option is used to embed the actual
signing key into a data signature. The embedded key is stripped down
to a single user id and includes only the signing subkey used to
create the signature as well as as valid encryption subkeys. All other
info is removed from the key to keep it and thus the signature small.
This option is the OpenPGP counterpart to the <strong>gpgsm</strong> option
<strong>–include-certs</strong> and allows the recipient of a signed message to
reply encrypted to the sender without using any online directories to
lookup the key. The default is <strong>–no-include-key-block</strong>. See also the
option <strong>–auto-key-import</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>–personal-cipher-preferences <em>string</em></strong> :: Set the list of personal
cipher preferences to <em>string</em>. Use <strong>gpg –version</strong> to get a list of
available algorithms, and use <strong>none</strong> to set no preference at all. This
allows the user to safely override the algorithm chosen by the
recipient key preferences, as GPG will only select an algorithm that
is usable by all recipients. The most highly ranked cipher in this
list is also used for the <strong>–symmetric</strong> encryption command.</li>
<li><strong>–personal-digest-preferences <em>string</em></strong> :: Set the list of personal
digest preferences to <em>string</em>. Use <strong>gpg –version</strong> to get a list of
available algorithms, and use <strong>none</strong> to set no preference at all. This
allows the user to safely override the algorithm chosen by the
recipient key preferences, as GPG will only select an algorithm that
is usable by all recipients. The most highly ranked digest algorithm
in this list is also used when signing without encryption (e.g.
<strong>–clear-sign</strong> or <strong>–sign</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>–personal-compress-preferences <em>string</em></strong> :: Set the list of personal
compression preferences to <em>string</em>. Use <strong>gpg –version</strong> to get a list
of available algorithms, and use <strong>none</strong> to set no preference at all.
This allows the user to safely override the algorithm chosen by the
recipient key preferences, as GPG will only select an algorithm that
is usable by all recipients. The most highly ranked compression
algorithm in this list is also used when there are no recipient keys
to consider (e.g. <strong>–symmetric</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>–s2k-cipher-algo <em>name</em></strong> :: Use <em>name</em> as the cipher algorithm for
symmetric encryption with a passphrase if
<strong>–personal-cipher-preferences</strong> and <strong>–cipher-algo</strong> are not given. The
default is AES-128.</li>
<li><strong>–s2k-digest-algo <em>name</em></strong> :: Use <em>name</em> as the digest algorithm used
to mangle the passphrases for symmetric encryption. The default is
SHA-1.</li>
<li><strong>–s2k-mode <em>n</em></strong> :: Selects how passphrases for symmetric encryption
are mangled. If <em>n</em> is 0 a plain passphrase (which is in general not
recommended) will be used, a 1 adds a salt (which should not be used)
to the passphrase and a 3 (the default) iterates the whole process a
number of times (see <strong>–s2k-count</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>–s2k-count <em>n</em></strong> :: Specify how many times the passphrases mangling
for symmetric encryption is repeated. This value may range between
1024 and 65011712 inclusive. The default is inquired from gpg-agent.
Note that not all values in the 1024-65011712 range are legal and if
an illegal value is selected, GnuPG will round up to the nearest legal
value. This option is only meaningful if <strong>–s2k-mode</strong> is set to the
default of 3.</li>

These options control what GnuPG is compliant to. Only one of these

OPENPGP PROGRAMS section below before using one of these options.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>–gnupg</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use standard GnuPG behavior. This is essentially OpenPGP
behavior (see <strong>–openpgp</strong>), but with extension from the proposed
update to OpenPGP and with some additional workarounds for common
compatibility problems in different versions of PGP. This is the
default option, so it is not generally needed, but it may be useful to
override a different compliance option in the gpg.conf file.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–openpgp</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict
OpenPGP behavior. This option implies <strong>–allow-old-cipher-algos</strong>. Use
this option to reset all previous options like <strong>–s2k-*</strong>,
<strong>–cipher-algo</strong>, <strong>–digest-algo</strong> and <strong>–compress-algo</strong> to OpenPGP
compliant values. All PGP workarounds are disabled.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–rfc4880</strong>

RFC-4880 behavior. This option implies <strong>–allow-old-cipher-algos</strong>.
Note that this is currently the same thing as <strong>–openpgp</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–rfc4880bis</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to
strict according to the proposed updates of RFC-4880.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–rfc2440</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict
RFC-2440 behavior. Note that by using this option encryption packets
are created in a legacy mode without MDC protection. This is dangerous
and should thus only be used for experiments. This option implies
<strong>–allow-old-cipher-algos</strong>. See also option <strong>–ignore-mdc-error</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–pgp6</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option is obsolete; it is handled as an alias for
<strong>–pgp7</strong></dd>
<dt>
<strong>–pgp7</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set up all options to be as PGP 7 compliant as possible.
This allowed the ciphers IDEA, 3DES, CAST5,AES128, AES192, AES256, and
TWOFISH., the hashes MD5, SHA1 and RIPEMD160, and the compression
algorithms none and ZIP. This option implies <strong>–escape-from-lines</strong> and
disables <strong>–throw-keyids</strong>,</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–pgp8</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set up all options to be as PGP 8 compliant as possible.
PGP 8 is a lot closer to the OpenPGP standard than previous versions
of PGP, so all this does is disable <strong>–throw-keyids</strong> and set
<strong>–escape-from-lines</strong>. All algorithms are allowed except for the
SHA224, SHA384, and SHA512 digests.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–compliance <em>string</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option can be used instead of one of
the options above. Valid values for <em>string</em> are the above option
names (without the double dash) and possibly others as shown when
using &#34;help&#34; for <em>string</em>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–min-rsa-length <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option adjusts the compliance mode
&#34;de-vs&#34; for stricter key size requirements. For example, a value of
3000 turns rsa2048 and dsa2048 keys into non-VS-NfD compliant keys.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–require-compliance</strong>
</dt>
<dd>To check that data has been encrypted
according to the rules of the current compliance mode, a gpg user
needs to evaluate the status lines. This is allows frontends to handle
compliance check in a more flexible way. However, for scripted use the
required evaluation of the status-line requires quite some effort;
this option can be used instead to make sure that the gpg process
exits with a failure if the compliance rules are not fulfilled. Note
that this option has currently an effect only in &#34;de-vs&#34; mode.</dd>

<dd><strong>–log-file <em>file</em></strong><br>

data is written to file <em>file</em>. Use ‘/socket:///&#39; to log to s socket.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–log-time</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Prefix all log output with a timestamp even if no log
file is used.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–attribute-fd <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Write attribute subpackets to the file

the status messages are needed to separate out the various subpackets
from the stream delivered to the file descriptor.</dd>

<dd><strong>–comment <em>string</em></strong><br>
<strong>–no-comments</strong> :: Use <em>string</em> as a comment string in cleartext
signatures and ASCII armored messages or keys (see <strong>–armor</strong>). The
default behavior is not to use a comment string. <strong>–comment</strong> may be
repeated multiple times to get multiple comment strings.
<strong>–no-comments</strong> removes all comments. It is a good idea to keep the
length of a single comment below 60 characters to avoid problems with
mail programs wrapping such lines. Note that comment lines, like all
other header lines, are not protected by the signature.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–emit-version</strong><br>
<strong>–no-emit-version</strong> :: Force inclusion of the version string in ASCII
armored output. If given once only the name of the program and the
major number is emitted, given twice the minor is also emitted, given
thrice the micro is added, and given four times an operating system
identification is also emitted. <strong>–no-emit-version</strong> (default) disables
the version line.</dd>

</dt>
<dd><strong>–sig-notation {<em>name/=/value</em>}</strong><br>
<strong>–cert-notation {<em>name/=/value</em>}</strong><br>
<strong>-N, –set-notation {<em>name/=/value</em>}</strong> :: Put the name value pair into
the signature as notation data. <em>name</em> must consist only of printable
characters or spaces, and must contain a &#39;@&#39; character in the form
keyname@domain.example.com (substituting the appropriate keyname and
domain name, of course). This is to help prevent pollution of the IETF
reserved notation namespace. The <strong>–expert</strong> flag overrides the &#39;@&#39;
check. <em>value</em> may be any printable string; it will be encoded in
UTF-8, so you should check that your <strong>–display-charset</strong> is set
correctly. If you prefix <em>name</em> with an exclamation mark (!), the
notation data will be flagged as critical (rfc4880:5.2.3.16).
<strong>–sig-notation</strong> sets a notation for data signatures.
<strong>–cert-notation</strong> sets a notation for key signatures (certifications).
<strong>–set-notation</strong> sets both.

There are special codes that may be used in notation names. &#34;%k&#34; will
be expanded into the key ID of the key being signed, &#34;%K&#34; into the
long key ID of the key being signed, &#34;%f&#34; into the fingerprint of the
key being signed, &#34;%s&#34; into the key ID of the key making the
signature, &#34;%S&#34; into the long key ID of the key making the signature,
&#34;%g&#34; into the fingerprint of the key making the signature (which might
be a subkey), &#34;%p&#34; into the fingerprint of the primary key of the key
making the signature, &#34;%c&#34; into the signature count from the OpenPGP
smartcard, and &#34;%%&#34; results in a single &#34;%&#34;. %k, %K, and %f are only
meaningful when making a key signature (certification), and %c is only
meaningful when using the OpenPGP smartcard.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–known-notation <em>name</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Adds <em>name</em> to a list of known critical
signature notations. The effect of this is that gpg will not mark a
signature with a critical signature notation of that name as bad. Note
that gpg already knows by default about a few critical signatures
notation names.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–sig-policy-url <em>string</em></strong><br>
<strong>–cert-policy-url <em>string</em></strong><br>
<strong>–set-policy-url <em>string</em></strong> :: Use <em>string</em> as a Policy URL for
signatures (rfc4880:5.2.3.20). If you prefix it with an exclamation
mark (!), the policy URL packet will be flagged as critical.
<strong>–sig-policy-url</strong> sets a policy url for data signatures.
<strong>–cert-policy-url</strong> sets a policy url for key signatures
(certifications). <strong>–set-policy-url</strong> sets both.

The same %-expandos used for notation data are available here as well.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–sig-keyserver-url <em>string</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use <em>string</em> as a preferred
keyserver URL for data signatures. If you prefix it with an
exclamation mark (!), the keyserver URL packet will be flagged as
critical.

The same %-expandos used for notation data are available here as well.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–set-filename <em>string</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use <em>string</em> as the filename which is
stored inside messages. This overrides the default, which is to use
the actual filename of the file being encrypted. Using the empty
string for <em>string</em> effectively removes the filename from the output.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–for-your-eyes-only</strong><br>
<strong>–no-for-your-eyes-only</strong> :: Set the `for your eyes only&#39; flag in the
message. This causes GnuPG to refuse to save the file unless the
<strong>–output</strong> option is given, and PGP to use a &#34;secure viewer&#34; with a
claimed Tempest-resistant font to display the message. This option
overrides <strong>–set-filename</strong>. <strong>–no-for-your-eyes-only</strong> disables this
option.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–use-embedded-filename</strong><br>
<strong>–no-use-embedded-filename</strong> :: Try to create a file with a name as
embedded in the data. This can be a dangerous option as it enables
overwriting files by giving the sender control on how to store files.
Defaults to no. Note that the option <strong>–output</strong> overrides this option.

A better approach than using this option is to decrypt to a temporary
filename and then rename that file to the embedded file name after
checking that the embedded filename is harmless. When using the
<strong>–status-fd</strong> option gpg tells the filename as part of the PLAINTEXT
status message. If the filename is important, the use of <strong>gpgtar</strong> is
another option because gpgtar will never overwrite a file but decrypt
the files to a new directory.

Note also that unless a modern version 5 signature is used the
embedded filename is not part of the signed data.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–cipher-algo <em>name</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use <em>name</em> as cipher algorithm. Running the
program with the command <strong>–version</strong> yields a list of supported
algorithms. If this is not used the cipher algorithm is selected from
the preferences stored with the key. In general, you do not want to
use this option as it allows you to violate the OpenPGP standard. The
option <strong>–personal-cipher-preferences</strong> is the safe way to accomplish
the same thing.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–digest-algo <em>name</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use <em>name</em> as the message digest algorithm.
Running the program with the command <strong>–version</strong> yields a list of
supported algorithms. In general, you do not want to use this option
as it allows you to violate the OpenPGP standard. The option
<strong>–personal-digest-preferences</strong> is the safe way to accomplish the same
thing.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–compress-algo <em>name</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use compression algorithm <em>name</em>. &#34;zlib&#34;
is RFC-1950 ZLIB compression. &#34;zip&#34; is RFC-1951 ZIP compression which
is used by PGP. &#34;bzip2&#34; is a more modern compression scheme that can
compress some things better than zip or zlib, but at the cost of more
memory used during compression and decompression. &#34;uncompressed&#34; or
&#34;none&#34; disables compression. If this option is not used, the default
behavior is to examine the recipient key preferences to see which
algorithms the recipient supports. If all else fails, ZIP is used for
maximum compatibility.

ZLIB may give better compression results than ZIP, as the compression
window size is not limited to 8k. BZIP2 may give even better
compression results than that, but will use a significantly larger
amount of memory while compressing and decompressing. This may be
significant in low memory situations. Note, however, that PGP (all
versions) only supports ZIP compression. Using any algorithm other
than ZIP or &#34;none&#34; will make the message unreadable with PGP. In
general, you do not want to use this option as it allows you to
violate the OpenPGP standard. The option
<strong>–personal-compress-preferences</strong> is the safe way to accomplish the
same thing.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–cert-digest-algo <em>name</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use <em>name</em> as the message digest
algorithm used when signing a key. Running the program with the
command <strong>–version</strong> yields a list of supported algorithms. Be aware
that if you choose an algorithm that GnuPG supports but other OpenPGP
implementations do not, then some users will not be able to use the
key signatures you make, or quite possibly your entire key. Note also
that a public key algorithm must be compatible with the specified
digest algorithm; thus selecting an arbitrary digest algorithm may
result in error messages from lower crypto layers or lead to security
flaws.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–disable-cipher-algo <em>name</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Never allow the use of <em>name</em> as
cipher algorithm. The given name will not be checked so that a later
loaded algorithm will still get disabled.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–disable-pubkey-algo <em>name</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Never allow the use of <em>name</em> as
public key algorithm. The given name will not be checked so that a
later loaded algorithm will still get disabled.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–throw-keyids</strong><br>
<strong>–no-throw-keyids</strong> :: Do not put the recipient key IDs into encrypted
messages. This helps to hide the receivers of the message and is a
limited countermeasure against traffic analysis. ([Using a little
social engineering anyone who is able to decrypt the message can check
whether one of the other recipients is the one he suspects.]) On the
receiving side, it may slow down the decryption process because all
available secret keys must be tried. <strong>–no-throw-keyids</strong> disables this
option. This option is essentially the same as using
<strong>–hidden-recipient</strong> for all recipients.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–not-dash-escaped</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option changes the behavior of cleartext
signatures so that they can be used for patch files. You should not
send such an armored file via email because all spaces and line
endings are hashed too. You can not use this option for data which has
5 dashes at the beginning of a line, patch files don&#39;t have this. A
special armor header line tells GnuPG about this cleartext signature
option.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–escape-from-lines</strong><br>
<strong>–no-escape-from-lines</strong> :: Because some mailers change lines starting
with &#34;From &#34; to &#34;&gt;From &#34; it is good to handle such lines in a special
way when creating cleartext signatures to prevent the mail system from
breaking the signature. Note that all other PGP versions do it this
way too. Enabled by default. <strong>–no-escape-from-lines</strong> disables this
option.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–passphrase-repeat <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specify how many times <strong>gpg</strong> will request
a new passphrase be repeated. This is useful for helping memorize a
passphrase. Defaults to 1 repetition; can be set to 0 to disable any
passphrase repetition. Note that a <em>n</em> greater than 1 will pop up the
pinentry window /n/+1 times even if a modern pinentry with two entry
fields is used.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–passphrase-fd <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Read the passphrase from file descriptor <em>n</em>.
Only the first line will be read from file descriptor <em>n</em>. If you use
0 for <em>n</em>, the passphrase will be read from STDIN. This can only be
used if only one passphrase is supplied.

Note that since Version 2.0 this passphrase is only used if the option
<strong>–batch</strong> has also been given. Since Version 2.1 the <strong>–pinentry-mode</strong>
also needs to be set to <strong>loopback</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–passphrase-file <em>file</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Read the passphrase from file <em>file</em>.
Only the first line will be read from file <em>file</em>. This can only be
used if only one passphrase is supplied. Obviously, a passphrase
stored in a file is of questionable security if other users can read
this file. Don&#39;t use this option if you can avoid it.

Note that since Version 2.0 this passphrase is only used if the option
<strong>–batch</strong> has also been given. Since Version 2.1 the <strong>–pinentry-mode</strong>
also needs to be set to <strong>loopback</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–passphrase <em>string</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use <em>string</em> as the passphrase. This can
only be used if only one passphrase is supplied. Obviously, this is of
very questionable security on a multi-user system. Don&#39;t use this
option if you can avoid it.

Note that since Version 2.0 this passphrase is only used if the option
<strong>–batch</strong> has also been given. Since Version 2.1 the <strong>–pinentry-mode</strong>
also needs to be set to <strong>loopback</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–pinentry-mode <em>mode</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the pinentry mode to <em>mode</em>. Allowed
values for <em>mode</em> are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>default</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use the default of the agent, which is <strong>ask</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>ask</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Force the use of the Pinentry.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>cancel</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Emulate use of Pinentry&#39;s cancel button.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>error</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Return a Pinentry error (``No Pinentry&#39;&#39;).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>loopback</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Redirect Pinentry queries to the caller. Note that in
contrast to Pinentry the user is not prompted again if he enters a
bad password.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-symkey-cache</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Disable the passphrase cache used for
symmetrical en- and decryption. This cache is based on the message
specific salt value (cf. <strong>–s2k-mode</strong>).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–request-origin <em>origin</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Tell gpg to assume that the operation
ultimately originated at <em>origin</em>. Depending on the origin certain
restrictions are applied and the Pinentry may include an extra note on
the origin. Supported values for <em>origin</em> are: <strong>local</strong> which is the
default, <strong>remote</strong> to indicate a remote origin or <strong>browser</strong> for an
operation requested by a web browser.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–command-fd <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is a replacement for the deprecated
shared-memory IPC mode. If this option is enabled, user input on
questions is not expected from the TTY but from the given file
descriptor. It should be used together with <strong>–status-fd</strong>. See the
file doc/DETAILS in the source distribution for details on how to use
it.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–command-file <em>file</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Same as <strong>–command-fd</strong>, except the commands
are read out of file <em>file</em></dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–allow-non-selfsigned-uid</strong><br>
<strong>–no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid</strong> :: Allow the import and use of keys
with user IDs which are not self-signed. This is not recommended, as a
non self-signed user ID is trivial to forge.
<strong>–no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid</strong> disables.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–allow-freeform-uid</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Disable all checks on the form of the user
ID while generating a new one. This option should only be used in very
special environments as it does not ensure the de-facto standard
format of user IDs.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–ignore-time-conflict</strong>
</dt>
<dd>GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps
associated with keys and signatures have plausible values. However,
sometimes a signature seems to be older than the key due to clock
problems. This option makes these checks just a warning. See also
<strong>–ignore-valid-from</strong> for timestamp issues on subkeys.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–ignore-valid-from</strong>
</dt>
<dd>GnuPG normally does not select and use
subkeys created in the future. This option allows the use of such keys
and thus exhibits the pre-1.0.7 behaviour. You should not use this
option unless there is some clock problem. See also
<strong>–ignore-time-conflict</strong> for timestamp issues with signatures.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–ignore-crc-error</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The ASCII armor used by OpenPGP is protected
by a CRC checksum against transmission errors. Occasionally the CRC
gets mangled somewhere on the transmission channel but the actual
content (which is protected by the OpenPGP protocol anyway) is still
okay. This option allows GnuPG to ignore CRC errors.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–ignore-mdc-error</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option changes a MDC integrity protection
failure into a warning. It is required to decrypt old messages which
did not use an MDC. It may also be useful if a message is partially
garbled, but it is necessary to get as much data as possible out of
that garbled message. Be aware that a missing or failed MDC can be an
indication of an attack. Use with great caution; see also option
<strong>–rfc2440</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–allow-old-cipher-algos</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Old cipher algorithms like 3DES, IDEA,
or CAST5 encrypt data using blocks of 64 bits; modern algorithms use
blocks of 128 bit instead. To avoid certain attack on these old
algorithms it is suggested not to encrypt more than 150 MiByte using
the same key. For this reason gpg does not allow the use of 64 bit
block size algorithms for encryption unless this option is specified.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–allow-weak-digest-algos</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Signatures made with known-weak digest
algorithms are normally rejected with an ``invalid digest algorithm&#39;&#39;
message. This option allows the verification of signatures made with
such weak algorithms. MD5 is the only digest algorithm considered weak
by default. See also <strong>–weak-digest</strong> to reject other digest
algorithms.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–weak-digest <em>name</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Treat the specified digest algorithm as
weak. Signatures made over weak digests algorithms are normally
rejected. This option can be supplied multiple times if multiple
algorithms should be considered weak. See also
<strong>–allow-weak-digest-algos</strong> to disable rejection of weak digests. MD5
is always considered weak, and does not need to be listed explicitly.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–allow-weak-key-signatures</strong>
</dt>
<dd>To avoid a minor risk of collision
attacks on third-party key signatures made using SHA-1, those key
signatures are considered invalid. This options allows one to override
this restriction.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–override-compliance-check</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This was a temporary introduced
option and has no more effect.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-default-keyring</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Do not add the default keyring to the list
of keyrings. Note that GnuPG needs for almost all operations a
keyring. Thus if you use this option and do not provide alternate
keyrings via <strong>–keyring</strong>, then GnuPG will still use the default
keyring.

Note that if the option <strong>use-keyboxd</strong> is enabled in ‘/common.conf/&#39;,
no keyrings are used at all and keys are all maintained by the keyboxd
process in its own database.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-keyring</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Do not use any keyring at all. This overrides the
default and all options which specify keyrings.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–skip-verify</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Skip the signature verification step. This may be
used to make the decryption faster if the signature verification is
not needed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–with-key-data</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print key listings delimited by colons (like
<strong>–with-colons</strong>) and print the public key data.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–list-signatures</strong><br>
<strong>–list-sigs</strong> :: Same as <strong>–list-keys</strong>, but the signatures are listed
too. This command has the same effect as using <strong>–list-keys</strong> with
<strong>–with-sig-list</strong>. Note that in contrast to <strong>–check-signatures</strong> the
key signatures are not verified. This command can be used to create a
list of signing keys missing in the local keyring; for example:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
      gpg --list-sigs --with-colons USERID | \
        awk -F: &#39;$1==&#34;sig&#34; &amp;&amp; $2==&#34;?&#34; {if($13){print $13}else{print $5}}&#39;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>–fast-list-mode</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Changes the output of the list commands to work
faster; this is achieved by leaving some parts empty. Some
applications don&#39;t need the user ID and the trust information given in
the listings. By using this options they can get a faster listing. The
exact behaviour of this option may change in future versions. If you
are missing some information, don&#39;t use this option.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-literal</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is not for normal use. Use the source to see
for what it might be useful.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–set-filesize</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is not for normal use. Use the source to see
for what it might be useful.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–show-session-key</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Display the session key used for one message.
See <strong>–override-session-key</strong> for the counterpart of this option.

We think that Key Escrow is a Bad Thing; however the user should have
the freedom to decide whether to go to prison or to reveal the content
of one specific message without compromising all messages ever
encrypted for one secret key.

You can also use this option if you receive an encrypted message which
is abusive or offensive, to prove to the administrators of the
messaging system that the ciphertext transmitted corresponds to an
inappropriate plaintext so they can take action against the offending
user.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–override-session-key <em>string</em></strong><br>
<strong>–override-session-key-fd <em>fd</em></strong> :: Don&#39;t use the public key but the
session key <em>string</em> respective the session key taken from the first
line read from file descriptor <em>fd</em>. The format of this string is the
same as the one printed by <strong>–show-session-key</strong>. This option is
normally not used but comes handy in case someone forces you to reveal
the content of an encrypted message; using this option you can do this
without handing out the secret key. Note that using
<strong>–override-session-key</strong> may reveal the session key to all local users
via the global process table. Often it is useful to combine this
option with <strong>–no-keyring</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–ask-sig-expire</strong><br>
<strong>–no-ask-sig-expire</strong> :: When making a data signature, prompt for an
expiration time. If this option is not specified, the expiration time
set via <strong>–default-sig-expire</strong> is used. <strong>–no-ask-sig-expire</strong> disables
this option.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–default-sig-expire</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The default expiration time to use for
signature expiration. Valid values are &#34;0&#34; for no expiration, a number
followed by the letter d (for days), w (for weeks), m (for months), or
y (for years) (for example &#34;2m&#34; for two months, or &#34;5y&#34; for five
years), or an absolute date in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Defaults to &#34;0&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–ask-cert-expire</strong><br>
<strong>–no-ask-cert-expire</strong> :: When making a key signature, prompt for an

set via <strong>–default-cert-expire</strong> is used. <strong>–no-ask-cert-expire</strong>
disables this option.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–default-cert-expire</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The default expiration time to use for key
signature expiration. Valid values are &#34;0&#34; for no expiration, a number
followed by the letter d (for days), w (for weeks), m (for months), or
y (for years) (for example &#34;2m&#34; for two months, or &#34;5y&#34; for five
years), or an absolute date in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Defaults to &#34;0&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–default-new-key-algo <em>string</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option can be used to change
the default algorithms for key generation. The <em>string</em> is similar to
the arguments required for the command <strong>–quick-add-key</strong> but slightly
different. For example the current default of
<strong>&#34;rsa2048/cert,sign+rsa2048/encr&#34;</strong> (or <strong>&#34;rsa3072&#34;</strong>) can be changed to
the value of what we currently call future default, which is
<strong>&#34;ed25519/cert,sign+cv25519/encr&#34;</strong>. You need to consult the source
code to learn the details. Note that the advanced key generation
commands can always be used to specify a key algorithm directly.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-auto-trust-new-key</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When creating a new key the ownertrust of
the new key is set to ultimate. This option disables this and the user
needs to manually assign an ownertrust value.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–force-sign-key</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option modifies the behaviour of the
commands <strong>–quick-sign-key</strong>, <strong>–quick-lsign-key</strong>, and the &#34;sign&#34;
sub-commands of <strong>–edit-key</strong> by forcing the creation of a key
signature, even if one already exists.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–forbid-gen-key</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option is intended for use in the global
config file to disallow the use of generate key commands. Those
commands will then fail with the error code for Not Enabled.</dd>

<strong>–enable-special-filenames</strong>

number, refer to the file descriptor n and not to a file with that
name.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-expensive-trust-checks</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Experimental use only.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–preserve-permissions</strong>

<dd>Don&#39;t change the permissions of a secret
keyring back to user read/write only. Use this option only if you
really know what you are doing.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–default-preference-list <em>string</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set the list of default
preferences to <em>string</em>. This preference list is used for new keys and
becomes the default for &#34;setpref&#34; in the <strong>–edit-key</strong> menu.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–default-keyserver-url <em>name</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set the default keyserver URL to

a new self-signature on a key, which includes key generation and
changing preferences.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–list-config</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Display various internal configuration parameters

<dd>This is more or less dummy action. However it
parses the configuration file and returns with failure if the

<strong>–chuid <em>uid</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Change the current user to <em>uid</em> which may either
be a number or a name. This can be used from the root account to run
gpg for another user. If <em>uid</em> is not the current UID a standard PATH
is set and the envvar GNUPGHOME is unset. To override the latter the
option <strong>–homedir</strong> can be used. This option has only an effect when
used on the command line. This option has currently no effect at all
on Windows.</dd>

HOW TO SPECIFY A USER ID
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-20" class="outline-text-2">
<p>There are different ways to specify a user ID to GnuPG. Some of them are
only valid for <strong>gpg</strong> others are only good for <strong>gpgsm</strong>. Here is the
entire list of ways to specify a key:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>By key Id.</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This format is deduced from the length of the string
and its content or <strong>0x</strong> prefix. The key Id of an X.509 certificate are
the low 64 bits of its SHA-1 fingerprint. The use of key Ids is just a
shortcut, for all automated processing the fingerprint should be used.

When using <strong>gpg</strong> an exclamation mark (!) may be appended to force
using the specified primary or secondary key and not to try and
calculate which primary or secondary key to use.

The last four lines of the example give the key ID in their long form
as internally used by the OpenPGP protocol. You can see the long key
ID using the option <strong>–with-colons</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
234567C4
0F34E556E
01347A56A
0xAB123456

234AABBCC34567C4
0F323456784E56EAB
01AB3FED1347A5612
0x234AABBCC34567C4
</pre>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>By fingerprint.</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This format is deduced from the length of the
string and its content or the <strong>0x</strong> prefix. Note, that only the 20 byte
version fingerprint is available with <strong>gpgsm</strong> (i.e. the SHA-1 hash of
the certificate).

When using <strong>gpg</strong> an exclamation mark (!) may be appended to force
using the specified primary or secondary key and not to try and
calculate which primary or secondary key to use.

The best way to specify a key Id is by using the fingerprint. This
avoids any ambiguities in case that there are duplicated key IDs.</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
1234343434343434C434343434343434

</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>gpgsm</strong> also accepts colons between each pair of hexadecimal digits
because this is the de-facto standard on how to present X.509
fingerprints. <strong>gpg</strong> also allows the use of the space separated SHA-1
fingerprint as printed by the key listing commands.</p>

<dt>
<strong>. and + prefixes</strong>
</dt>
<dd>These prefixes are reserved for looking up mails
anchored at the end and for a word search mode. They are not yet
implemented and using them is undefined.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Please note that we have reused the hash mark identifier which was used
in old GnuPG versions to indicate the so called local-id. It is not
anymore used and there should be no conflict when used with X.509 stuff.</p>
<p>
Using the RFC-2253 format of DNs has the drawback that it is not
possible to map them back to the original encoding, however we don&#39;t
have to do this because our key database stores this encoding as meta
data.</p>

FILTER EXPRESSIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-21" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The options <strong>–import-filter</strong> and <strong>–export-filter</strong> use expressions with
this syntax (square brackets indicate an optional part and curly braces
a repetition, white space between the elements are allowed):</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
  [lc] {[{flag}] PROPNAME op VALUE [lc]}
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
The name of a property (<em>PROPNAME</em>) may only consist of letters, digits
and underscores. The description for the filter type describes which
properties are defined. If an undefined property is used it evaluates to
the empty string. Unless otherwise noted, the <em>VALUE</em> must always be
given and may not be the empty string. No quoting is defined for the
value, thus the value may not contain the strings <strong>&amp;&amp;</strong> or <strong>||</strong>, which
are used as logical connection operators. The flag <strong>–</strong> can be used to
remove this restriction.</p>
<p>
Numerical values are computed as long int; standard C notation applies.
<em>lc</em> is the logical connection operator; either <strong>&amp;&amp;</strong> for a conjunction
or <strong>||</strong> for a disjunction. A conjunction is assumed at the begin of an
expression. Conjunctions have higher precedence than disjunctions. If
<em>VALUE</em> starts with one of the characters used in any <em>op</em> a space after
the <em>op</em> is required.</p>
<p>

<dl>
<dt>
<strong>gpg.conf</strong>

You should backup this file.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>common.conf</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is an optional configuration file read by <strong>gpg</strong>
on startup. It may contain options pertaining to all components of
GnuPG. Its current main use is for the &#34;use-keyboxd&#34; option. If the
default home directory ‘/~/.gnupg/&#39; does not exist, GnuPG creates this
directory and a ‘/common.conf/&#39; file with &#34;use_keyboxd&#34;.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that on larger installations, it is useful to put predefined files
into the directory ‘//etc/skel/.gnupg/&#39; so that newly created users
start up with a working configuration. For existing users a small helper
script is provided to create these files (see: [addgnupghome]).</p>
<p>
For internal purposes <strong>gpg</strong> creates and maintains a few other files;
They all live in the current home directory (see: [option –homedir]).
Only the <strong>gpg</strong> program may modify these files.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>~/.gnupg</strong>

If this file is not available, <strong>gpg</strong> defaults to the new keybox format
and creates a file ‘/pubring.kbx/&#39; unless that file already exists in
which case that file will also be used for OpenPGP keys.

Note that in the case that both files, ‘/pubring.gpg/&#39; and
‘/pubring.kbx/&#39; exists but the latter has no OpenPGP keys, the legacy
file ‘/pubring.gpg/&#39; will be used. Take care: GnuPG versions before
2.1 will always use the file ‘/pubring.gpg/&#39; because they do not know
about the new keybox format. In the case that you have to use GnuPG
1.4 to decrypt archived data you should keep this file.</dd>

first backup the ownertrust values, then rename ‘/pubring.gpg/&#39; to

backup those certificates and if the primary private key is not stored
on the disk to move them to an external storage device. Anyone who can
access these files is able to revoke the corresponding key. You may

Programmatic use of GnuPG
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-25" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Please consider using GPGME instead of calling <strong>gpg</strong> directly. GPGME
offers a stable, backend-independent interface for many cryptographic
operations. It supports OpenPGP and S/MIME, and also allows interaction
with various GnuPG components.</p>
<p>
GPGME provides a C-API, and comes with bindings for C++, Qt, and Python.
Bindings for other languages are available.</p>

Ephemeral home directories
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-26" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Sometimes you want to contain effects of some operation, for example you
want to import a key to inspect it, but you do not want this key to be
added to your keyring. In earlier versions of GnuPG, it was possible to
specify alternate keyring files for both public and secret keys. In
modern GnuPG versions, however, we changed how secret keys are stored in
order to better protect secret key material, and it was not possible to
preserve this interface.</p>
<p>
The preferred way to do this is to use ephemeral home directories. This
technique works across all versions of GnuPG.</p>
<p>
Create a temporary directory, create (or copy) a configuration that
meets your needs, make *gpg*/ use this directory either/ using the
environment variable <em>GNUPGHOME, or the option</em> *–homedir*/. GPGME
supports this too on a per-context basis,/ by modifying the engine info
of contexts. Now execute whatever operation you like, import and export
key material as necessary. Once finished, you can delete the directory.
All GnuPG backend services that were started will detect this and shut
down.</p>

The quick key manipulation interface
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-27" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Recent versions of GnuPG have an interface to manipulate keys without
using the interactive command *–edit-key*/. This interface was/ added
mainly for the benefit of GPGME (please consider using GPGME, see the
manual subsection ``Programmatic use of GnuPG&#39;&#39;). This interface is
described in the subsection ``How to manage your keys&#39;&#39;.</p>

<h3 id="headline-28">
Unattended key generation
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-28" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
The command *–generate-key*/ may be used along with the option/
*–batch*/ for unattended key generation. This is the most/ flexible way
of generating keys, but it is also the most complex one. Consider using
the quick key manipulation interface described in the previous
subsection ``The quick key manipulation interface&#39;&#39;.</p>
<p>
The parameters for the key are either read from stdin or given as a file
on the command line. The format of the parameter file is as follows:
Text only, line length is limited to about 1000 characters. UTF-8
encoding must be used to specify non-ASCII characters. Empty lines are
ignored. Leading and trailing white space is ignored. A hash sign as the
first non white space character indicates a comment line. Control
statements are indicated by a leading percent sign, their arguments are
separated by white space from the keyword. Parameters are specified by a
keyword, followed by a colon; arguments are separated by white space.
The first parameter must be ‘Key-Type&#39; but control statements may be
placed anywhere. The order of the parameters does not matter except for
‘Key-Type&#39;. The parameters are only used for the generated keyblock
(primary and subkeys); parameters from previous sets are not used. Some
syntax checks may be performed. Key commences when either the end of the
parameter file is reached, the next ‘Key-Type&#39; parameter is encountered,
or the control statement ‘%commit&#39; is encountered.</p>
<p>
Control statements:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>%echo <em>text</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print <em>text as diagnostic.</em></dd>
<dt>
<strong>%dry-run</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Suppress actual key generation (useful for syntax
checking).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%commit</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Perform the key generation. Note that an implicit commit
is done at the next parameter.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%pubring <em>filename</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Do not write the key to the default or
commandline given keyring but to <em>filename. This must be given before
the first commit to take</em> place, duplicate specification of the same
filename is ignored, the last filename before a commit is used. The
filename is used until a new filename is used (at commit points) and
all keys are written to that file. If a new filename is given, this
file is created (and overwrites an existing one).

See the previous subsection ``Ephemeral home directories&#39;&#39; for a more
robust way to contain side-effects.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%secring <em>filename</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option is a no-op for GnuPG 2.1 and
later.

See the previous subsection ``Ephemeral home directories&#39;&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>%ask-passphrase</strong><br>
<strong>%no-ask-passphrase</strong> :: This option is a no-op since GnuPG version
2.1.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%no-protection</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Using this option allows the creation of keys
without any passphrase protection. This option is mainly intended for
regression tests.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%transient-key</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If given the keys are created using a faster and a
somewhat less secure random number generator. This option may be used
for keys which are only used for a short time and do not require full
cryptographic strength. It takes only effect if used together with the
control statement ‘%no-protection&#39;.</dd>
</dl>
<p>General Parameters:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Key-Type: <em>algo</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Starts a new parameter block by giving the type
of the primary key. The algorithm must be capable of signing. This is
a required parameter. <em>algo may either be an OpenPGP algorithm number
or a</em> string with the algorithm name. The special value ‘default&#39; may
be used for <em>algo to create the default key type; in this case a</em>
‘Key-Usage&#39; shall not be given and ‘default&#39; also be used for
‘Subkey-Type&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Key-Length: <em>nbits</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>The requested length of the generated key in
bits. The default is returned by running the command ‘gpg
–gpgconf-list&#39;. For ECC keys this parameter is ignored.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Key-Curve: <em>curve</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>The requested elliptic curve of the generated
key. This is a required parameter for ECC keys. It is ignored for
non-ECC keys.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Key-Grip: <em>hexstring</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is optional and used to generate a CSR
or certificate for an already existing key. Key-Length will be ignored
when given.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Key-Usage: <em>usage-list</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Space or comma delimited list of key
usages. Allowed values are ‘encrypt&#39;, ‘sign&#39;, and ‘auth&#39;. This is used
to generate the key flags. Please make sure that the algorithm is
capable of this usage. Note that OpenPGP requires that all primary
keys are capable of certification, so no matter what usage is given
here, the ‘cert&#39; flag will be on. If no ‘Key-Usage&#39; is specified and
the ‘Key-Type&#39; is not ‘default&#39;, all allowed usages for that
particular algorithm are used; if it is not given but ‘default&#39; is
used the usage will be ‘sign&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Subkey-Type: <em>algo</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>This generates a secondary key (subkey).
Currently only one subkey can be handled. See also ‘Key-Type&#39; above.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Subkey-Length: <em>nbits</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Length of the secondary key (subkey) in
bits. The default is returned by running the command ‘gpg
–gpgconf-list&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Subkey-Curve: <em>curve</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Key curve for a subkey; similar to
‘Key-Curve&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Subkey-Usage: <em>usage-list</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Key usage lists for a subkey; similar
to ‘Key-Usage&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Passphrase: <em>string</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>If you want to specify a passphrase for the
secret key, enter it here. Default is to use the Pinentry dialog to
ask for a passphrase.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>Name-Real: <em>name</em></strong><br>
<strong>Name-Comment: <em>comment</em></strong><br>
<strong>Name-Email: <em>email</em></strong> :: The three parts of a user name. Remember to
use UTF-8 encoding here. If you don&#39;t give any of them, no user ID is
created.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Expire-Date: <em>iso-date|(number[d|w|m|y])</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set the expiration date
for the key (and the subkey). It may either be entered in ISO date
format (e.g. &#34;20000815T145012&#34;) or as number of days, weeks, month or
years after the creation date. The special notation &#34;seconds=N&#34; is
also allowed to specify a number of seconds since creation. Without a
letter days are assumed. Note that there is no check done on the
overflow of the type used by OpenPGP for timestamps. Thus you better
make sure that the given value make sense. Although OpenPGP works with
time intervals, GnuPG uses an absolute value internally and thus the
last year we can represent is 2105.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Creation-Date: <em>iso-date</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set the creation date of the key as
stored in the key information and which is also part of the
fingerprint calculation. Either a date like &#34;1986-04-26&#34; or a full
timestamp like &#34;19860426T042640&#34; may be used. The time is considered
to be UTC. The special notation &#34;seconds=N&#34; may be used to directly
specify a the number of seconds since Epoch (Unix time). If it is not
given the current time is used.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Preferences: <em>string</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set the cipher, hash, and compression
preference values for this key. This expects the same type of string
as the sub-command ‘setpref&#39; in the *–edit-key*/ menu./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Revoker: <em>algo:fpr</em> [sensitive]</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Add a designated revoker to the
generated key. Algo is the public key algorithm of the designated
revoker (i.e. RSA=1, DSA=17, etc.) <em>fpr is the fingerprint of the
designated revoker. fpr may</em> not contain spaces or colons. The
optional ‘sensitive&#39; flag marks the designated revoker as sensitive
information. Only v4 and v5 keys may be designated revokers.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Keyserver: <em>string</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is an optional parameter that specifies
the preferred keyserver URL for the key.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Handle: <em>string</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is an optional parameter only used with the
status lines KEY_CREATED and KEY_NOT_CREATED. <em>string may be up to
100</em> characters and should not contain spaces. It is useful for batch
key generation to associate a key parameter block with a status line.</dd>

BUGS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-29" class="outline-text-2">
<p>On older systems this program should be installed as setuid(root). This
is necessary to lock memory pages. Locking memory pages prevents the
operating system from writing memory pages (which may contain
passphrases or other sensitive material) to disk. If you get no warning
message about insecure memory your operating system supports locking
without being root. The program drops root privileges as soon as locked
memory is allocated.</p>
<p>
Note also that some systems (especially laptops) have the ability to
``suspend to disk&#39;&#39; (also known as ``safe sleep&#39;&#39; or ``hibernate&#39;&#39;).
This writes all memory to disk before going into a low power or even
powered off mode. Unless measures are taken in the operating system to
protect the saved memory, passphrases or other sensitive material may be
recoverable from it later.</p>
