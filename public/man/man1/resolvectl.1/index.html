DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>resolvectl</strong> may be used to resolve domain names, IPv4 and IPv6
addresses, DNS resource records and services with the
*systemd-resolved.service*(8) resolver service. By default, the
specified list of parameters will be resolved as hostnames, retrieving
their IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. If the parameters specified are formatted
as IPv4 or IPv6 addresses the reverse operation is done, and a hostname
is retrieved for the specified addresses.</p>
<p>
The programs output contains information about the protocol used for the
look-up and on which network interface the data was discovered. It also
contains information on whether the information could be authenticated.
All data for which local DNSSEC validation succeeds is considered
authenticated. Moreover all data originating from local, trusted sources
is also reported authenticated, including resolution of the local host
name, the &#34;localhost&#34; hostname or all data from /etc/hosts.</p>

COMMANDS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>query</strong> <em>HOSTNAME|ADDRESS</em>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resolve domain names, as well as IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. When used in
conjunction with <strong>–type=</strong> or <strong>–class=</strong> (see below), resolves low-level
DNS resource records.</p>
<p>
If a single-label domain name is specified it is searched for according
to the configured search domains — unless <strong>–search=no</strong> or
<strong>–type=*/</strong>–class=* are specified, both of which turn this logic off.</p>
<p>
If an international domain name is specified, it is automatically
translated according to IDNA rules when resolved via classic DNS — but
not for look-ups via MulticastDNS or LLMNR. If <strong>–type=*/</strong>–class=* is
used IDNA translation is turned off and domain names are processed as
specified.</p>
<p>
If combined with <strong>–json=</strong> (only supported in combination with
<strong>–type=</strong>) will output the resource record data in a JSON object.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>service</strong> [[/NAME/] <em>TYPE/] /DOMAIN</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resolve <strong>RFC 6763 DNS-SD</strong>[1] and <strong>RFC 2782 SRV</strong>[2] services, depending
on the specified list of parameters. If three parameters are passed the
first is assumed to be the DNS-SD service name, the second the <strong>SRV</strong>
service type, and the third the domain to search in. In this case a full
DNS-SD style <strong>SRV</strong> and <strong>TXT</strong> lookup is executed. If only two parameters
are specified, the first is assumed to be the <strong>SRV</strong> service type, and
the second the domain to look in. In this case no <strong>TXT</strong> resource record
is requested. Finally, if only one parameter is specified, it is assumed
to be a domain name, that is already prefixed with an <strong>SRV</strong> type, and an
<strong>SRV</strong> lookup is done (no <strong>TXT</strong>).</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>openpgp</strong> <em>EMAIL@DOMAIN</em>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Query PGP keys stored as <strong>OPENPGPKEY</strong> resource records, see <strong>RFC
7929</strong>[3]. Specified e-mail addresses are converted to the corresponding
DNS domain name, and any <strong>OPENPGPKEY</strong> keys are printed.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>tlsa</strong> [/FAMILY/] <em>DOMAIN</em>[:/PORT/]…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Query TLS public keys stored as <strong>TLSA</strong> resource records, see <strong>RFC
6698</strong>[4]. A query will be performed for each of the specified names
prefixed with the port and family (&#34;_/port/._/family/./domain/&#34;). The
port number may be specified after a colon (&#34;:&#34;), otherwise <strong>443</strong> will
be used by default. The family may be specified as the first argument,
otherwise <strong>tcp</strong> will be used.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>status</strong> [/LINK/…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shows the global and per-link DNS settings currently in effect. If no
command is specified, this is the implied default.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>statistics</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shows general resolver statistics, including information whether DNSSEC
is enabled and available, as well as resolution and validation
statistics.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>reset-statistics</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resets the statistics counters shown in <strong>statistics</strong> to zero. This
operation requires root privileges.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>flush-caches</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flushes all DNS resource record caches the service maintains locally.
This is mostly equivalent to sending the <strong>SIGUSR2</strong> to the
<strong>systemd-resolved</strong> service.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>reset-server-features</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flushes all feature level information the resolver learnt about specific
servers, and ensures that the server feature probing logic is started
from the beginning with the next look-up request. This is mostly
equivalent to sending the <strong>SIGRTMIN+1</strong> to the <strong>systemd-resolved</strong>
service.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>

<strong>dns</strong> [/LINK/ [/SERVER/…]], <strong>domain</strong> [/LINK/ [/DOMAIN/…]],
<strong>default-route</strong> [/LINK/ [/BOOL/…]], <strong>llmnr</strong> [/LINK/ [/MODE/]], <strong>mdns</strong>
[/LINK/ [/MODE/]], <strong>dnssec</strong> [/LINK/ [/MODE/]], <strong>dnsovertls</strong> [/LINK/
[/MODE/]], <strong>nta</strong> [/LINK/ [/DOMAIN/…]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get/set per-interface DNS configuration. These commands may be used to
configure various DNS settings for network interfaces. These commands
may be used to inform <strong>systemd-resolved</strong> or <strong>systemd-networkd</strong> about
per-interface DNS configuration determined through external means. The
<strong>dns</strong> command expects IPv4 or IPv6 address specifications of DNS servers
to use. Each address can optionally take a port number separated with
&#34;:&#34;, a network interface name or index separated with &#34;%&#34;, and a Server
Name Indication (SNI) separated with &#34;#&#34;. When IPv6 address is specified
with a port number, then the address must be in the square brackets.
That is, the acceptable full formats are
&#34;111.222.333.444:9953%ifname#example.com&#34; for IPv4 and
&#34;[1111:2222::3333]:9953%ifname#example.com&#34; for IPv6. The <strong>domain</strong>
command expects valid DNS domains, possibly prefixed with &#34;~&#34;, and
configures a per-interface search or route-only domain. The
<strong>default-route</strong> command expects a boolean parameter, and configures
whether the link may be used as default route for DNS lookups, i.e. if
it is suitable for lookups on domains no other link explicitly is
configured for. The <strong>llmnr</strong>, <strong>mdns</strong>, <strong>dnssec</strong> and <strong>dnsovertls</strong> commands
may be used to configure the per-interface LLMNR, MulticastDNS, DNSSEC
and DNSOverTLS settings. Finally, <strong>nta</strong> command may be used to configure
additional per-interface DNSSEC NTA domains.</p>
<p>
Commands <strong>dns</strong>, <strong>domain</strong> and <strong>nta</strong> can take a single empty string
argument to clear their respective value lists.</p>
<p>
For details about these settings, their possible values and their
effect, see the corresponding settings in *systemd.network*(5).</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*revert */LINK/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Revert the per-interface DNS configuration. If the DNS configuration is
reverted all per-interface DNS setting are reset to their defaults,
undoing all effects of <strong>dns</strong>, <strong>domain</strong>, <strong>default-route</strong>, <strong>llmnr</strong>,
<strong>mdns</strong>, <strong>dnssec</strong>, <strong>dnsovertls</strong>, <strong>nta</strong>. Note that when a network
interface disappears all configuration is lost automatically, an
explicit reverting is not necessary in that case.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>monitor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show a continuous stream of local client resolution queries and their
responses. Whenever a local query is completed the querys DNS resource
lookup key and resource records are shown. Note that this displays
queries issued locally only, and does not immediately relate to DNS
requests submitted to configured DNS servers or the LLMNR or
MulticastDNS zones, as lookups may be answered from the local cache, or
might result in multiple DNS transactions (for example to validate
DNSSEC information). If CNAME/CNAME redirection chains are followed, a
separate query will be displayed for each element of the chain. Use
<strong>–json=</strong> to enable JSON output.</p>
<p>
Added in version 252.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>show-cache</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show current cache content, per scope. Use <strong>–json=</strong> to enable JSON
output.</p>
<p>
Added in version 254.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>show-server-state</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show detailed server state information, per DNS Server. Use <strong>–json=</strong> to
enable JSON output.</p>
<p>
Added in version 255.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>log-level</strong> [/LEVEL/]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If no argument is given, print the current log level of the manager. If
an optional argument <em>LEVEL</em> is provided, then the command changes the
current log level of the manager to <em>LEVEL</em> (accepts the same values as
<strong>–log-level=</strong> described in *systemd*(1)).</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>-4</strong>, <strong>-6</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, when resolving a hostname, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are
acquired. By specifying <strong>-4</strong> only IPv4 addresses are requested, by
specifying <strong>-6</strong> only IPv6 addresses are requested.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-i</strong> <em>INTERFACE</em>, *–interface=*/INTERFACE/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the network interface to execute the query on. This may either
be specified as numeric interface index or as network interface string
(e.g. &#34;en0&#34;). Note that this option has no effect if system-wide DNS
configuration (as configured in /etc/resolv.conf or
/etc/systemd/resolved.conf) in place of per-link configuration is used.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-p</strong> <em>PROTOCOL</em>, *–protocol=*/PROTOCOL/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the network protocol for the query. May be one of &#34;dns&#34; (i.e.
classic unicast DNS), &#34;llmnr&#34; (<strong>Link-Local Multicast Name
Resolution</strong>[5]), &#34;llmnr-ipv4&#34;, &#34;llmnr-ipv6&#34; (LLMNR via the indicated
underlying IP protocols), &#34;mdns&#34; (<strong>Multicast DNS</strong>[6]), &#34;mdns-ipv4&#34;,
&#34;mdns-ipv6&#34; (MDNS via the indicated underlying IP protocols). By default
the lookup is done via all protocols suitable for the lookup. If used,
limits the set of protocols that may be used. Use this option multiple
times to enable resolving via multiple protocols at the same time. The
setting &#34;llmnr&#34; is identical to specifying this switch once with
&#34;llmnr-ipv4&#34; and once via &#34;llmnr-ipv6&#34;. Note that this option does not
force the service to resolve the operation with the specified protocol,
as that might require a suitable network interface and configuration.
The special value &#34;help&#34; may be used to list known values.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-t</strong> <em>TYPE</em>, <strong>–type=*/TYPE/, *-c</strong> <em>CLASS</em>, *–class=*/CLASS/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When used in conjunction with the <strong>query</strong> command, specifies the DNS
resource record type (e.g. <strong>A</strong>, <strong>AAAA</strong>, <strong>MX</strong>, …) and class (e.g. <strong>IN</strong>,
<strong>ANY</strong>, …) to look up. If these options are used a DNS resource record
set matching the specified class and type is requested. The class
defaults to <strong>IN</strong> if only a type is specified. The special value &#34;help&#34;
may be used to list known values.</p>
<p>
Without these options <strong>resolvectl query</strong> provides high-level domain name
to address and address to domain name resolution. With these options it
provides low-level DNS resource record resolution. The search domain
logic is automatically turned off when these options are used, i.e.
specified domain names need to be fully qualified domain names.
Moreover, IDNA internal domain name translation is turned off as well,
i.e. international domain names should be specified in &#34;xn–…&#34;
notation, unless look-up in MulticastDNS/LLMNR is desired, in which case
UTF-8 characters should be used.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–service-address=*/BOOL/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean parameter. If true (the default), when doing a service
lookup with <strong>–service</strong> the hostnames contained in the <strong>SRV</strong> resource
records are resolved as well.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–service-txt=*/BOOL/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean parameter. If true (the default), when doing a DNS-SD
service lookup with <strong>–service</strong> the <strong>TXT</strong> service metadata record is
resolved as well.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–cname=*/BOOL/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean parameter. If true (the default), DNS <strong>CNAME</strong> or <strong>DNAME</strong>
redirections are followed. Otherwise, if a CNAME or DNAME record is
encountered while resolving, an error is returned.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–validate=*/BOOL/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <strong>query</strong>. If true
(the default), DNSSEC validation is applied as usual — under the
condition that it is enabled for the network and for
systemd-resolved.service as a whole. If false, DNSSEC validation is
disabled for the specific query, regardless of whether it is enabled for
the network or in the service. Note that setting this option to true
does not force DNSSEC validation on systems/networks where DNSSEC is
turned off. This option is only suitable to turn off such validation
where otherwise enabled, not enable validation where otherwise disabled.</p>
<p>
Added in version 248.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–synthesize=*/BOOL/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <strong>query</strong>. If true
(the default), select domains are resolved on the local system, among
them &#34;localhost&#34;, &#34;_gateway&#34;, &#34;_outbound&#34;, &#34;_localdnsstub&#34; and
&#34;_localdnsproxy&#34; or entries from /etc/hosts. If false these domains are
not resolved locally, and either fail (in case of &#34;localhost&#34;,
&#34;_gateway&#34; or &#34;_outbound&#34; and suchlike) or go to the network via regular
DNS/mDNS/LLMNR lookups (in case of /etc/hosts entries).</p>
<p>
Added in version 248.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–cache=*/BOOL/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <strong>query</strong>. If true
(the default), lookups use the local DNS resource record cache. If
false, lookups are routed to the network instead, regardless if already
available in the local cache.</p>
<p>
Added in version 248.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–zone=*/BOOL/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <strong>query</strong>. If true
(the default), lookups are answered from locally registered LLMNR or
mDNS resource records, if defined. If false, locally registered
LLMNR/mDNS records are not considered for the lookup request.</p>
<p>
Added in version 248.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–trust-anchor=*/BOOL/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <strong>query</strong>. If true
(the default), lookups for DS and DNSKEY are answered from the local
DNSSEC trust anchors if possible. If false, the local trust store is not
considered for the lookup request.</p>
<p>
Added in version 248.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–network=*/BOOL/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <strong>query</strong>. If true
(the default), lookups are answered via DNS, LLMNR or mDNS network
requests if they cannot be synthesized locally, or be answered from the
local cache, zone or trust anchors (see above). If false, the request is
not answered from the network and will thus fail if none of the
indicated sources can answer them.</p>
<p>
Added in version 248.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–search=*/BOOL/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean parameter. If true (the default), any specified
single-label hostnames will be searched in the domains configured in the
search domain list, if it is non-empty. Otherwise, the search domain
logic is disabled. Note that this option has no effect if <strong>–type=</strong> is
used (see above), in which case the search domain logic is
unconditionally turned off.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–raw</strong>[=payload|packet]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dump the answer as binary data. If there is no argument or if the
argument is &#34;payload&#34;, the payload of the packet is exported. If the
argument is &#34;packet&#34;, the whole packet is dumped in wire format,
prefixed by length specified as a little-endian 64-bit number. This
format allows multiple packets to be dumped and unambiguously parsed.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–legend=*/BOOL/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean parameter. If true (the default), column headers and
meta information about the query response are shown. Otherwise, this
output is suppressed.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–stale-data=*/BOOL/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <strong>query</strong>. If true
(the default), lookups are answered with stale data (expired resource
records) if possible. If false, the stale data is not considered for the
lookup request.</p>
<p>
Added in version 254.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–relax-single-label=*/BOOL/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <strong>query</strong>. If true,
rules regarding routing of single-label names are relaxed. Defaults to
false. By default, lookups of single label names are assumed to refer to
local hosts to be resolved via local resolution such as LLMNR or via
search domain qualification and are not routed to upstream servers as
is. If this option is enabled these rules are disabled and the queries
are routed upstream anyway. Also see the <em>ResolveUnicastSingleLabel=</em>
option in *resolved.conf*(5) which provides a system-wide option that
controls this behaviour.</p>
<p>
Added in version 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–json=*/MODE/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of &#34;short&#34; (for the shortest
possible output without any redundant whitespace or line breaks),
&#34;pretty&#34; (for a pretty version of the same, with indentation and line
breaks) or &#34;off&#34; (to turn off JSON output, the default).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-j</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Equivalent to <strong>–json=pretty</strong> if running on a terminal, and
<strong>–json=short</strong> otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–no-pager</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not pipe output into a pager.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-h</strong>, <strong>–help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short help text and exit.</p>

COMPATIBILITY WITH RESOLVCONF(8)
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>resolvectl</strong> is a multi-call binary. When invoked as &#34;resolvconf&#34;
(generally achieved by means of a symbolic link of this name to the
<strong>resolvectl</strong> binary) it is run in a limited *resolvconf*(8)
compatibility mode. It accepts mostly the same arguments and pushes all
data into <strong>systemd-resolved.service*(8), similar to how *dns</strong> and
<strong>domain</strong> commands operate. Note that <strong>systemd-resolved.service</strong> is the
only supported backend, which is different from other implementations of
this command.</p>
<p>
/etc/resolv.conf will only be updated with servers added with this
command when /etc/resolv.conf is a symlink to
/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf, and not a static file. See the
discussion of /etc/resolv.conf handling in
*systemd-resolved.service*(8).</p>
<p>
Not all operations supported by other implementations are supported
natively. Specifically:</p>
<p>
<strong>-a</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Registers per-interface DNS configuration data with <strong>systemd-resolved</strong>.
Expects a network interface name as only command line argument. Reads
*resolv.conf*(5)-compatible DNS configuration data from its standard
input. Relevant fields are &#34;nameserver&#34; and &#34;domain&#34;/&#34;search&#34;. This
command is mostly identical to invoking <strong>resolvectl</strong> with a combination
of <strong>dns</strong> and <strong>domain</strong> commands.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-d</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unregisters per-interface DNS configuration data with
<strong>systemd-resolved</strong>. This command is mostly identical to invoking
<strong>resolvectl revert</strong>.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-f</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified <strong>-a</strong> and <strong>-d</strong> will not complain about missing network
interfaces and will silently execute no operation in that case.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-x</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This switch for &#34;exclusive&#34; operation is supported only partially. It is
mapped to an additional configured search domain of &#34;~.&#34; — i.e.
ensures that DNS traffic is preferably routed to the DNS servers on this
interface, unless there are other, more specific domains configured on
other interfaces.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-m</strong>, <strong>-p</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These switches are not supported and are silently ignored.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-u</strong>, <strong>-I</strong>, <strong>-i</strong>, <strong>-l</strong>, <strong>-R</strong>, <strong>-r</strong>, <strong>-v</strong>, <strong>-V</strong>, <strong>–enable-updates</strong>,
<strong>–disable-updates</strong>, <strong>–are-updates-enabled</strong></p>
