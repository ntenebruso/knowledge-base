DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Modifies the index. Each file mentioned is updated into the index and
any <em>unmerged</em> or <em>needs updating</em> state is cleared.</p>
<p>
See also *git-add*(1) for a more user-friendly way to do some of the
most common operations on the index.</p>
<p>
The way <em>git update-index</em> handles files it is told about can be
modified using the various options:</p>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-4">
OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>–add</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a specified file isn&#39;t in the index already then it&#39;s added. Default
behaviour is to ignore new files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–remove</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a specified file is in the index but is missing then it&#39;s removed.
Default behavior is to ignore removed files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–refresh</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looks at the current index and checks to see if merges or updates are
needed by checking stat() information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-q</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quiet. If –refresh finds that the index needs an update, the default
behavior is to error out. This option makes <em>git update-index</em> continue
anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignore-submodules</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not try to update submodules. This option is only respected when
passed before –refresh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–unmerged</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If –refresh finds unmerged changes in the index, the default behavior
is to error out. This option makes <em>git update-index</em> continue anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignore-missing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignores missing files during a –refresh</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–cacheinfo &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;object&gt;,&lt;path&gt;, –cacheinfo &lt;mode&gt; &lt;object&gt; &lt;path&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Directly insert the specified info into the index. For backward
compatibility, you can also give these three arguments as three separate
parameters, but new users are encouraged to use a single-parameter form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–index-info</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read index information from stdin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–chmod=(+|-)x</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the execute permissions on the updated files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]assume-unchanged</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When this flag is specified, the object names recorded for the paths are
not updated. Instead, this option sets/unsets the &#34;assume unchanged&#34; bit
for the paths. When the &#34;assume unchanged&#34; bit is on, the user promises
not to change the file and allows Git to assume that the working tree
file matches what is recorded in the index. If you want to change the
working tree file, you need to unset the bit to tell Git. This is
sometimes helpful when working with a big project on a filesystem that
has a very slow lstat(2) system call (e.g. cifs).</p>
<p>
Git will fail (gracefully) in case it needs to modify this file in the
index e.g. when merging in a commit; thus, in case the assumed-untracked
file is changed upstream, you will need to handle the situation
manually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–really-refresh</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like <strong>–refresh</strong>, but checks stat information unconditionally, without
regard to the &#34;assume unchanged&#34; setting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]skip-worktree</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When one of these flags is specified, the object names recorded for the
paths are not updated. Instead, these options set and unset the
&#34;skip-worktree&#34; bit for the paths. See section &#34;Skip-worktree bit&#34; below
for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]ignore-skip-worktree-entries</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not remove skip-worktree (AKA &#34;index-only&#34;) entries even when the
<strong>–remove</strong> option was specified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]fsmonitor-valid</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When one of these flags is specified, the object names recorded for the
paths are not updated. Instead, these options set and unset the
&#34;fsmonitor valid&#34; bit for the paths. See section &#34;File System Monitor&#34;
below for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-g, –again</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Runs <em>git update-index</em> itself on the paths whose index entries are
different from those of the <strong>HEAD</strong> commit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–unresolve</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Restores the <em>unmerged</em> or <em>needs updating</em> state of a file during a
merge if it was cleared by accident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–info-only</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not create objects in the object database for all &lt;file&gt; arguments
that follow this flag; just insert their object IDs into the index.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–force-remove</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remove the file from the index even when the working directory still has
such a file. (Implies –remove.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–replace</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, when a file <strong>path</strong> exists in the index, <em>git update-index</em>
refuses an attempt to add <strong>path/file</strong>. Similarly if a file <strong>path/file</strong>
exists, a file <strong>path</strong> cannot be added. With –replace flag, existing
entries that conflict with the entry being added are automatically
removed with warning messages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–stdin</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of taking a list of paths from the command line, read a list of
paths from the standard input. Paths are separated by LF (i.e. one path
per line) by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–verbose</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Report what is being added and removed from the index.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–index-version &lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write the resulting index out in the named on-disk format version.
Supported versions are 2, 3, and 4. The current default version is 2 or
3, depending on whether extra features are used, such as <strong>git add -N</strong>.
With <strong>–verbose</strong>, also report the version the index file uses before and
after this command.</p>
<p>
Version 4 performs a simple pathname compression that reduces index size
by 30%-50% on large repositories, which results in faster load time. Git
supports it since version 1.8.0, released in October 2012, and support
for it was added to libgit2 in 2016 and to JGit in 2020. Older versions
of this manual page called it &#34;relatively young&#34;, but it should be
considered mature technology these days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–show-index-version</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Report the index format version used by the on-disk index file. See
<strong>–index-version</strong> above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-z</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only meaningful with <strong>–stdin</strong> or <strong>–index-info</strong>; paths are separated
with NUL character instead of LF.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–split-index, –no-split-index</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable or disable split index mode. If split-index mode is already
enabled and <strong>–split-index</strong> is given again, all changes in
$GIT_DIR/index are pushed back to the shared index file.</p>
<p>
These options take effect whatever the value of the <strong>core.splitIndex</strong>
configuration variable (see *git-config*(1)). But a warning is emitted
when the change goes against the configured value, as the configured
value will take effect next time the index is read and this will remove
the intended effect of the option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–untracked-cache, –no-untracked-cache</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable or disable untracked cache feature. Please use
<strong>–test-untracked-cache</strong> before enabling it.</p>
<p>
These options take effect whatever the value of the
<strong>core.untrackedCache</strong> configuration variable (see *git-config*(1)). But
a warning is emitted when the change goes against the configured value,
as the configured value will take effect next time the index is read and
this will remove the intended effect of the option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–test-untracked-cache</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only perform tests on the working directory to make sure untracked cache
can be used. You have to manually enable untracked cache using
<strong>–untracked-cache</strong> or <strong>–force-untracked-cache</strong> or the
<strong>core.untrackedCache</strong> configuration variable afterwards if you really
want to use it. If a test fails the exit code is 1 and a message
explains what is not working as needed, otherwise the exit code is 0 and
OK is printed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–force-untracked-cache</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Same as <strong>–untracked-cache</strong>. Provided for backwards compatibility with
older versions of Git where <strong>–untracked-cache</strong> used to imply
<strong>–test-untracked-cache</strong> but this option would enable the extension
unconditionally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–fsmonitor, –no-fsmonitor</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable or disable files system monitor feature. These options take
effect whatever the value of the <strong>core.fsmonitor</strong> configuration variable
(see *git-config*(1)). But a warning is emitted when the change goes
against the configured value, as the configured value will take effect
next time the index is read and this will remove the intended effect of
the option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not interpret any more arguments as options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;file&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Files to act on. Note that files beginning with <em>.</em> are discarded. This
includes <strong>./file</strong> and <strong>dir/./file</strong>. If you don&#39;t want this, then use
cleaner names. The same applies to directories ending <em>/</em> and paths with
<em>//</em></p>

USING –REFRESH
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>–refresh</strong> does not calculate a new sha1 file or bring the index up to
date for mode/content changes. But what it <strong>does</strong> do is to &#34;re-match&#34;
the stat information of a file with the index, so that you can refresh
the index for a file that hasn&#39;t been changed but where the stat entry
is out of date.</p>
<p>
For example, you&#39;d want to do this after doing a <em>git read-tree</em>, to
link up the stat index details with the proper files.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-6">
USING –CACHEINFO OR –INFO-ONLY
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>–cacheinfo</strong> is used to register a file that is not in the current
working directory. This is useful for minimum-checkout merging.</p>
<p>
To pretend you have a file at path with mode and sha1, say:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git update-index --add --cacheinfo &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;sha1&gt;,&lt;path&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–info-only</strong> is used to register files without placing them in the
object database. This is useful for status-only repositories.</p>
<p>
Both <strong>–cacheinfo</strong> and <strong>–info-only</strong> behave similarly: the index is
updated but the object database isn&#39;t. <strong>–cacheinfo</strong> is useful when the
object is in the database but the file isn&#39;t available locally.
<strong>–info-only</strong> is useful when the file is available, but you do not wish
to update the object database.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-7">
USING –INDEX-INFO
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>–index-info</strong> is a more powerful mechanism that lets you feed multiple
entry definitions from the standard input, and designed specifically for
scripts. It can take inputs of three formats:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>mode SP type SP sha1 TAB path</p>
<p>
This format is to stuff <strong>git ls-tree</strong> output into the index.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>mode SP sha1 SP stage TAB path</p>
<p>
This format is to put higher order stages into the index file and
matches <em>git ls-files –stage</em> output.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>mode SP sha1 TAB path</p>
<p>
This format is no longer produced by any Git command, but is and will
continue to be supported by <strong>update-index –index-info</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To place a higher stage entry to the index, the path should first be
removed by feeding a mode=0 entry for the path, and then feeding
necessary input lines in the third format.</p>
<p>
For example, starting with this index:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git ls-files -s
100644 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 0       frotz
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
you can feed the following input to <strong>–index-info</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git update-index --index-info
0 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000      frotz
100644 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 1       frotz
100755 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 2       frotz
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The first line of the input feeds 0 as the mode to remove the path; the
SHA-1 does not matter as long as it is well formatted. Then the second
and third line feeds stage 1 and stage 2 entries for that path. After
the above, we would end up with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git ls-files -s
100644 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 1       frotz
100755 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 2       frotz
</pre>

USING “ASSUME UNCHANGED” BIT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Many operations in Git depend on your filesystem to have an efficient
<strong>lstat(2)</strong> implementation, so that <strong>st_mtime</strong> information for working
tree files can be cheaply checked to see if the file contents have
changed from the version recorded in the index file. Unfortunately, some
filesystems have inefficient <strong>lstat(2)</strong>. If your filesystem is one of
them, you can set &#34;assume unchanged&#34; bit to paths you have not changed
to cause Git not to do this check. Note that setting this bit on a path
does not mean Git will check the contents of the file to see if it has
changed — it makes Git to omit any checking and assume it has <strong>not</strong>
changed. When you make changes to working tree files, you have to
explicitly tell Git about it by dropping &#34;assume unchanged&#34; bit, either
before or after you modify them.</p>
<p>
In order to set &#34;assume unchanged&#34; bit, use <strong>–assume-unchanged</strong> option.
To unset, use <strong>–no-assume-unchanged</strong>. To see which files have the
&#34;assume unchanged&#34; bit set, use <strong>git ls-files -v</strong> (see
*git-ls-files*(1)).</p>
<p>
The command looks at <strong>core.ignorestat</strong> configuration variable. When this
is true, paths updated with <strong>git update-index paths…</strong> and paths
updated with other Git commands that update both index and working tree
(e.g. <em>git apply –index</em>, <em>git checkout-index -u</em>, and <em>git read-tree
-u</em>) are automatically marked as &#34;assume unchanged&#34;. Note that &#34;assume
unchanged&#34; bit is <strong>not</strong> set if <strong>git update-index –refresh</strong> finds the
working tree file matches the index (use <strong>git update-index
–really-refresh</strong> if you want to mark them as &#34;assume unchanged&#34;).</p>
<p>
Sometimes users confuse the assume-unchanged bit with the skip-worktree
bit. See the final paragraph in the &#34;Skip-worktree bit&#34; section below
for an explanation of the differences.</p>

<h2 id="headline-10">
SKIP-WORKTREE BIT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Skip-worktree bit can be defined in one (long) sentence: Tell git to
avoid writing the file to the working directory when reasonably
possible, and treat the file as unchanged when it is not present in the
working directory.</p>
<p>
Note that not all git commands will pay attention to this bit, and some
only partially support it.</p>
<p>
The update-index flags and the read-tree capabilities relating to the
skip-worktree bit predated the introduction of the
*git-sparse-checkout*(1) command, which provides a much easier way to
configure and handle the skip-worktree bits. If you want to reduce your
working tree to only deal with a subset of the files in the repository,
we strongly encourage the use of *git-sparse-checkout*(1) in preference
to the low-level update-index and read-tree primitives.</p>
<p>
The primary purpose of the skip-worktree bit is to enable sparse
checkouts, i.e. to have working directories with only a subset of paths
present. When the skip-worktree bit is set, Git commands (such as
<strong>switch</strong>, <strong>pull</strong>, <strong>merge</strong>) will avoid writing these files. However,
these commands will sometimes write these files anyway in important
cases such as conflicts during a merge or rebase. Git commands will also
avoid treating the lack of such files as an intentional deletion; for
example <strong>git add -u</strong> will not stage a deletion for these files and <strong>git
commit -a</strong> will not make a commit deleting them either.</p>
<p>
Although this bit looks similar to assume-unchanged bit, its goal is
different. The assume-unchanged bit is for leaving the file in the
working tree but having Git omit checking it for changes and presuming
that the file has not been changed (though if it can determine without
stat&#39;ing the file that it has changed, it is free to record the
changes). skip-worktree tells Git to ignore the absence of the file,
avoid updating it when possible with commands that normally update much
of the working directory (e.g. <strong>checkout</strong>, <strong>switch</strong>, <strong>pull</strong>, etc.), and
not have its absence be recorded in commits. Note that in sparse
checkouts (setup by <strong>git sparse-checkout</strong> or by configuring
core.sparseCheckout to true), if a file is marked as skip-worktree in
the index but is found in the working tree, Git will clear the
skip-worktree bit for that file.</p>

SPLIT INDEX
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-2">
<p>This mode is designed for repositories with very large indexes, and aims
at reducing the time it takes to repeatedly write these indexes.</p>
<p>
In this mode, the index is split into two files, $GIT_DIR/index and
$GIT_DIR/sharedindex.&lt;SHA-1&gt;. Changes are accumulated in $GIT_DIR/index,
the split index, while the shared index file contains all index entries
and stays unchanged.</p>
<p>
All changes in the split index are pushed back to the shared index file
when the number of entries in the split index reaches a level specified
by the splitIndex.maxPercentChange config variable (see
*git-config*(1)).</p>
<p>
Each time a new shared index file is created, the old shared index files
are deleted if their modification time is older than what is specified
by the splitIndex.sharedIndexExpire config variable (see
*git-config*(1)).</p>
<p>
To avoid deleting a shared index file that is still used, its
modification time is updated to the current time every time a new split
index based on the shared index file is either created or read from.</p>

<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-2">
<p>This cache is meant to speed up commands that involve determining
untracked files such as <strong>git status</strong>.</p>
<p>
This feature works by recording the mtime of the working tree
directories and then omitting reading directories and stat calls against
files in those directories whose mtime hasn&#39;t changed. For this to work
the underlying operating system and file system must change the
<strong>st_mtime</strong> field of directories if files in the directory are added,
modified or deleted.</p>
<p>
You can test whether the filesystem supports that with the
<strong>–test-untracked-cache</strong> option. The <strong>–untracked-cache</strong> option used to
implicitly perform that test in older versions of Git, but that&#39;s no
longer the case.</p>
<p>
If you want to enable (or disable) this feature, it is easier to use the
<strong>core.untrackedCache</strong> configuration variable (see <strong>git-config*(1)) than
using the *–untracked-cache</strong> option to <strong>git update-index</strong> in each
repository, especially if you want to do so across all repositories you
use, because you can set the configuration variable to <strong>true</strong> (or
<strong>false</strong>) in your <strong>$HOME/.gitconfig</strong> just once and have it affect all
repositories you touch.</p>
<p>
When the <strong>core.untrackedCache</strong> configuration variable is changed, the
untracked cache is added to or removed from the index the next time a
command reads the index; while when <strong>–[no-|force-]untracked-cache</strong> are
used, the untracked cache is immediately added to or removed from the
index.</p>
<p>
Before 2.17, the untracked cache had a bug where replacing a directory
with a symlink to another directory could cause it to incorrectly show
files tracked by git as untracked. See the &#34;status: add a failing test
showing a core.untrackedCache bug&#34; commit to git.git. A workaround for
that is (and this might work for other undiscovered bugs in the future):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git -c core.untrackedCache=false status
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This bug has also been shown to affect non-symlink cases of replacing a
directory with a file when it comes to the internal structures of the
untracked cache, but no case has been reported where this resulted in
wrong &#34;git status&#34; output.</p>
<p>
There are also cases where existing indexes written by git versions
before 2.17 will reference directories that don&#39;t exist anymore,
potentially causing many &#34;could not open directory&#34; warnings to be
printed on &#34;git status&#34;. These are new warnings for existing issues that
were previously silently discarded.</p>
<p>
As with the bug described above the solution is to one-off do a &#34;git
status&#34; run with <strong>core.untrackedCache=false</strong> to flush out the leftover
bad data.</p>

FILE SYSTEM MONITOR
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-2">
<p>This feature is intended to speed up git operations for repos that have
large working directories.</p>
<p>
It enables git to work together with a file system monitor (see
*git-fsmonitor–daemon*(1) and the &#34;fsmonitor-watchman&#34; section of
*githooks*(5)) that can inform it as to what files have been modified.
This enables git to avoid having to lstat() every file to find modified
files.</p>
<p>
When used in conjunction with the untracked cache, it can further
improve performance by avoiding the cost of scanning the entire working
directory looking for new files.</p>
<p>
If you want to enable (or disable) this feature, it is easier to use the
<strong>core.fsmonitor</strong> configuration variable (see <strong>git-config*(1)) than using
the *–fsmonitor</strong> option to <strong>git update-index</strong> in each repository,
especially if you want to do so across all repositories you use, because
you can set the configuration variable in your <strong>$HOME/.gitconfig</strong> just
once and have it affect all repositories you touch.</p>
<p>
When the <strong>core.fsmonitor</strong> configuration variable is changed, the file
system monitor is added to or removed from the index the next time a
command reads the index. When <strong>–[no-]fsmonitor</strong> are used, the file
system monitor is immediately added to or removed from the index.</p>

CONFIGURATION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The command honors <strong>core.filemode</strong> configuration variable. If your
repository is on a filesystem whose executable bits are unreliable, this
should be set to <em>false</em> (see *git-config*(1)). This causes the command
to ignore differences in file modes recorded in the index and the file
mode on the filesystem if they differ only on executable bit. On such an
unfortunate filesystem, you may need to use <em>git update-index –chmod=</em>.</p>
<p>
Quite similarly, if <strong>core.symlinks</strong> configuration variable is set to
<em>false</em> (see *git-config*(1)), symbolic links are checked out as plain
files, and this command does not modify a recorded file mode from
symbolic link to regular file.</p>
<p>
The command looks at <strong>core.ignorestat</strong> configuration variable. See
<em>Using &#34;assume unchanged&#34; bit</em> section above.</p>
<p>
The command also looks at <strong>core.trustctime</strong> configuration variable. It
can be useful when the inode change time is regularly modified by
something outside Git (file system crawlers and backup systems use ctime
for marking files processed) (see *git-config*(1)).</p>
<p>
The untracked cache extension can be enabled by the
<strong>core.untrackedCache</strong> configuration variable (see *git-config*(1)).</p>

NOTES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Users often try to use the assume-unchanged and skip-worktree bits to
tell Git to ignore changes to files that are tracked. This does not work
as expected, since Git may still check working tree files against the
index when performing certain operations. In general, Git does not
provide a way to ignore changes to tracked files, so alternate solutions
are recommended.</p>
<p>
For example, if the file you want to change is some sort of config file,
the repository can include a sample config file that can then be copied
into the ignored name and modified. The repository can even include a
script to treat the sample file as a template, modifying and copying it
automatically.</p>
