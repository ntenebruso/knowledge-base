SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Some shell builtin commands take options as described in individual
entries; these are often referred to in the list below as `*flags*&#39; to
avoid confusion with shell options, which may also have an effect on the
behaviour of builtin commands. In this introductory section, `*option*&#39;
always has the meaning of an option to a command that should be familiar
to most command line users.</p>
<p>
Typically, options are single letters preceded by a hyphen (<strong>-</strong>).
Options that take an argument accept it either immediately following the
option letter or after white space, for example `*print -C3 {1..9}*&#39; or
`*print -C 3 {1..9}*&#39; are equivalent. Arguments to options are not the
same as arguments to the command; the documentation indicates which is
which. Options that do not take an argument may be combined in a single
word, for example `*print -rca – <strong>*&#39; and `*print -r -c -a – *</strong>&#39; are
equivalent.</p>
<p>
Some shell builtin commands also take options that begin with `*+*&#39;
instead of `*-*&#39;. The list below makes clear which commands these are.</p>
<p>
Options (together with their individual arguments, if any) must appear
in a group before any non-option arguments; once the first non-option
argument has been found, option processing is terminated.</p>
<p>
All builtin commands other than `*echo*&#39; and precommand modifiers, even
those that have no options, can be given the argument `*–*&#39; to
terminate option processing. This indicates that the following words are
non-option arguments, but is otherwise ignored. This is useful in cases
where arguments to the command may begin with `*-<strong>&#39;. For historical
reasons, most builtin commands (including `*echo</strong>&#39;) also recognize a
single `*-<strong>&#39; in a separate word for this purpose; note that this is less
standard and use of `</strong>–*&#39; is recommended.</p>
<p>
<strong>-</strong> <em>simple command</em> See the section `Precommand Modifiers&#39; in
/zshmisc/(1).</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>.</strong> <em>file</em> [ <em>arg</em> … ]
</dt>
<dd>Read commands from <em>file</em> and execute them
in the current shell environment.

If <em>file</em> does not contain a slash, or if <strong>PATH_DIRS</strong> is set, the
shell looks in the components of <strong>$path</strong> to find the directory
containing <em>file</em>. Files in the current directory are not read unless
`*.*&#39; appears somewhere in <strong>$path</strong>. If a file named `/file/*.zwc*&#39; is
found, is newer than <em>file</em>, and is the compiled form (created with
the <strong>zcompile</strong> builtin) of <em>file</em>, then commands are read from that
file instead of <em>file</em>.

If any arguments <em>arg</em> are given, they become the positional
parameters; the old positional parameters are restored when the <em>file</em>
is done executing. However, if no arguments are given, the positional
parameters remain those of the calling context, and no restoring is
done.

If <em>file</em> was not found the return status is 127; if <em>file</em> was found
but contained a syntax error the return status is 126; else the return
status is the exit status of the last command executed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>:</strong> [ <em>arg</em> … ]
</dt>
<dd>This command does nothing, although normal
argument expansions is performed which may have effects on shell
parameters. A zero exit status is returned.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>alias</strong> [ {<strong>+*|</strong>-<strong>}*gmrsL</strong> ] [ <em>name</em>[*=*/value/] … ]
</dt>
<dd>
<p>For each
<em>name</em> with a corresponding <em>value</em>, define an alias with that value.
A trailing space in <em>value</em> causes the next word to be checked for
alias expansion. If the <strong>-g</strong> flag is present, define a global alias;
global aliases are expanded even if they do not occur in command
position:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
% perldoc --help 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep &#39;built-in functions&#39;
    -f   Search Perl built-in functions
% alias -g HG=&#39;--help 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep&#39;
% perldoc HG &#39;built-in functions&#39;
    -f   Search Perl built-in functions
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If the <strong>-s</strong> flag is present, define a suffix alias: if the command
word on a command line is in the form `/text/*.*/name/&#39;, where <em>text</em>
is any non-empty string, it is replaced by the text `/value/
<em>text/*.*/name</em>&#39;. Note that <em>name</em> is treated as a literal string, not
a pattern. A trailing space in <em>value</em> is not special in this case.
For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
alias -s ps=&#39;gv --&#39;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
will cause the command `**.ps*&#39; to be expanded to `*gv – <strong>.ps</strong>&#39;. As
alias expansion is carried out earlier than globbing, the `**.ps*&#39;
will then be expanded. Suffix aliases constitute a different name
space from other aliases (so in the above example it is still possible
to create an alias for the command <strong>ps</strong>) and the two sets are never
listed together.</p>
<p>
For each <em>name</em> with no <em>value</em>, print the value of <em>name</em>, if any.
With no arguments, print all currently defined aliases other than
suffix aliases. If the <strong>-m</strong> flag is given the arguments are taken as
patterns (they should be quoted to preserve them from being
interpreted as glob patterns), and the aliases matching these patterns
are printed. When printing aliases and one of the <strong>-g</strong>, <strong>-r</strong> or <strong>-s</strong>
flags is present, restrict the printing to global, regular or suffix
aliases, respectively; a regular alias is one which is neither a
global nor a suffix alias. Using `*+*&#39; instead of `*-<strong>&#39;, or ending the
option list with a single `*+</strong>&#39;, prevents the values of the aliases
from being printed.</p>
<p>
If the <strong>-L</strong> flag is present, then print each alias in a manner
suitable for putting in a startup script. The exit status is nonzero
if a <em>name</em> (with no <em>value</em>) is given for which no alias has been
defined.</p>
<p>
For more on aliases, include common problems, see the section ALIASING
in /zshmisc/(1).</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>autoload</strong> [ {<strong>+*|</strong>-<strong>}*RTUXdkmrtWz</strong> ] [ <strong>-w</strong> ] [ <em>name</em> … ]
</dt>
<dd>
<p>See
the section `Autoloading Functions&#39; in /zshmisc/(1) for full details.
The <strong>fpath</strong> parameter will be searched to find the function definition
when the function is first referenced.</p>
<p>
If <em>name</em> consists of an absolute path, the function is defined to
load from the file given (searching as usual for dump files in the
given location). The name of the function is the basename
(non-directory part) of the file. It is normally an error if the
function is not found in the given location; however, if the option
<strong>-d</strong> is given, searching for the function defaults to <strong>$fpath</strong>. If a
function is loaded by absolute path, any functions loaded from it that
are marked for <strong>autoload</strong> without an absolute path have the load path
of the parent function temporarily prepended to <strong>$fpath</strong>.</p>
<p>
If the option <strong>-r</strong> or <strong>-R</strong> is given, the function is searched for
immediately and the location is recorded internally for use when the
function is executed; a relative path is expanded using the value of
<strong>$PWD</strong>. This protects against a change to <strong>$fpath</strong> after the call to
<strong>autoload</strong>. With <strong>-r</strong>, if the function is not found, it is silently
left unresolved until execution; with <strong>-R</strong>, an error message is
printed and command processing aborted immediately the search fails,
i.e. at the <strong>autoload</strong> command rather than at function execution..</p>
<p>
The flag <strong>-X</strong> may be used only inside a shell function. It causes the
calling function to be marked for autoloading and then immediately
loaded and executed, with the current array of positional parameters
as arguments. This replaces the previous definition of the function.
If no function definition is found, an error is printed and the
function remains undefined and marked for autoloading. If an argument
is given, it is used as a directory (i.e. it does not include the name
of the function) in which the function is to be found; this may be
combined with the <strong>-d</strong> option to allow the function search to default
to <strong>$fpath</strong> if it is not in the given location.</p>
<p>
The flag <strong>+X</strong> attempts to load each <em>name</em> as an autoloaded function,
but does <em>not</em> execute it. The exit status is zero (success) if the
function was not previously defined <em>and</em> a definition for it was
found. This does <em>not</em> replace any existing definition of the
function. The exit status is nonzero (failure) if the function was
already defined or when no definition was found. In the latter case
the function remains undefined and marked for autoloading. If
ksh-style autoloading is enabled, the function created will contain
the contents of the file plus a call to the function itself appended
to it, thus giving normal ksh autoloading behaviour on the first call
to the function. If the <strong>-m</strong> flag is also given each <em>name</em> is treated
as a pattern and all functions already marked for autoload that match
the pattern are loaded.</p>
<p>
With the <strong>-t</strong> flag, turn on execution tracing; with <strong>-T</strong>, turn on
execution tracing only for the current function, turning it off on
entry to any called functions that do not also have tracing enabled.</p>
<p>
With the <strong>-U</strong> flag, alias expansion is suppressed when the function is
loaded.</p>
<p>
With the <strong>-w</strong> flag, the /name/s are taken as names of files compiled
with the <strong>zcompile</strong> builtin, and all functions defined in them are
marked for autoloading.</p>
<p>
The flags <strong>-z</strong> and <strong>-k</strong> mark the function to be autoloaded using the
zsh or ksh style, as if the option <strong>KSH_AUTOLOAD</strong> were unset or were
set, respectively. The flags override the setting of the option at the
time the function is loaded.</p>
<p>
Note that the <strong>autoload</strong> command makes no attempt to ensure the shell
options set during the loading or execution of the file have any
particular value. For this, the <strong>emulate</strong> command can be used:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
emulate zsh -c &#39;autoload -Uz func&#39;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
arranges that when <em>func is loaded the shell is in native /*zsh*
emulation, and this emulation is also applied when /func is run.</em></p>
<p>
Some of the functions of <strong>autoload*/ are also provided by /*functions</strong>
-u/ or <em><strong>functions -U</strong></em>, but <em><strong>autoload</strong></em> is a more comprehensive/
interface.</p>

first form, change the current directory to <em>arg, or to the value of
/*$HOME*</em> if/ <em>arg is not specified. If arg is `/*-*</em>&#39;, change to the/
previous directory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Otherwise, if <em>arg begins with a slash, attempt to change to the</em>
directory given by <em>arg.</em></p>
<p>
If <em>arg does not begin with a slash, the behaviour depends on whether</em>
the current directory `*.*/&#39; occurs in the list of directories
contained/ in the shell parameter *cdpath*/. If it does not, first
attempt to change/ to the directory <em>arg under the current directory,
and if that fails</em> but *cdpath*/ is set and contains at least one
element attempt to change/ to the directory <em>arg under each component of
/*cdpath*</em> in turn until/ successful. If `*.*/&#39; occurs in <em><strong>cdpath</strong></em>,
then <em><strong>cdpath</strong></em> is searched/ strictly in order so that `*.*/&#39; is only
tried at the appropriate point./</p>
<p>
The order of testing <strong>cdpath*/ is modified if the option /*POSIX_CD</strong> is
set, as described in the documentation for the option.</p>
<p>
If no directory is found, the option *CDABLE_VARS*/ is set, and a/
parameter named <em>arg exists whose value begins with a slash, treat its</em>
value as the directory. In that case, the parameter is added to the
named directory hash table.</p>
<p>
The second form of *cd*/ substitutes the string new/ for the string <em>old
in the name of the current directory,</em> and tries to change to this new
directory.</p>
<p>
The third form of *cd*/ extracts an entry from the directory/ stack, and
changes to that directory. An argument of the form `*+*/n&#39; identifies a
stack entry by counting from the left/ of the list shown by the <strong>dirs*/
command, starting with zero./ An argument of the form `</strong>-*/n&#39; counts
from the right./ If the <strong>PUSHD_MINUS*/ option is set, the meanings of
`/*+*/&#39;/ and `</strong>-*/&#39; in this context are swapped./ If the *POSIX_CD*/
option is set, this form of <em><strong>cd</strong></em> is not recognised/ and will be
interpreted as the first form.</p>
<p>
If the <strong>-q*/ (quiet) option is specified, the hook function /*chpwd</strong> and
the functions in the array *chpwd_functions*/ are not called./ This is
useful for calls to *cd*/ that do not change the environment/ seen by an
interactive user.</p>
<p>
If the *-s*/ option is specified, <em><strong>cd</strong></em> refuses to change the current/
directory if the given pathname contains symlinks. If the *-P*/ option/
is given or the *CHASE_LINKS*/ option is set, symbolic links are
resolved/ to their true values. If the *-L*/ option is given symbolic
links are/ retained in the directory (and not resolved) regardless of
the state of the *CHASE_LINKS*/ option./</p>

<p>Temporarily disable the <em>named
hash table elements or patterns. The default</em> is to disable builtin
commands. This allows you to use an external command with the same
name as a builtin command. The <strong>-a*/ option/ causes *disable*/ to act
on regular or global aliases. The /</strong>-s* option causes <strong>disable*/ to
act on suffix aliases. The /</strong>-f*/ option causes/ <strong>disable*/ to act on
shell functions. The /</strong>-r*/ options causes/ *disable*/ to act on
reserved words. Without arguments all disabled/ hash table elements
from the corresponding hash table are printed. With the *-m*/ flag the
arguments are taken as patterns (which should be/ quoted to prevent
them from undergoing filename expansion), and all hash table elements
from the corresponding hash table matching these patterns are
disabled. Disabled objects can be enabled with the <strong>enable</strong> command.</p>
<p>
With the option *-p*/, name … refer to elements of the/ shell&#39;s

Certain elements can be disabled separately, as given below.</p>
<p>
Note that patterns not allowed by the current settings for the options
*EXTENDED_GLOB*/,/ *KSH_GLOB*/ and <em><strong>SH_GLOB</strong></em> are never enabled,

<p><strong>emulate*/ [ /</strong>-lLR*/ ] [ {<em><strong>zsh*/|/*sh*/|/*ksh*/|/*csh</strong></em>} [ flags …
] ]/ :: Without any argument print current emulation mode.</p>
<p>
With single argument set up zsh options to emulate the specified shell
as much as possible. <strong>csh*/ will never be fully emulated./ If the
argument is not one of the shells listed above, *zsh</strong> will be used as
a default; more precisely, the tests performed on the argument are the
same as those used to determine the emulation at startup based on the
shell name, see the section COMPATIBILITY in <em>zsh(1)</em> . In addition to
setting shell options, the command also restores the pristine state of
pattern enables, as if all patterns had been enabled using *enable
-p*/./</p>
<p>
If the <strong>emulate*/ command occurs inside a function that has been/
marked for execution tracing with *functions -t*/ then the /*xtrace</strong>
option will be turned on regardless of emulation mode or other
options. Note that code executed inside the function by the *.*/,
<em><strong>source</strong></em>, or/ *eval*/ commands is not considered to be running
directly from the/ function, hence does not provoke this behaviour.</p>
<p>
If the *-R*/ switch is given, all settable options/ are reset to their
default value corresponding to the specified emulation mode, except
for certain options describing the interactive environment; otherwise,
only those options likely to cause portability problems in scripts and
functions are altered. If the <strong>-L*/ switch is given,/ the options
*LOCAL_OPTIONS*/, <em><strong>LOCAL_PATTERNS</strong></em> and /*LOCAL_TRAPS</strong> will be set as
well, causing the effects of the *emulate*/ command and any
<em><strong>setopt</strong></em>,/ *disable -p*/ or <em><strong>enable -p</strong></em>, and <em><strong>trap</strong></em> commands to
be local to/ the immediately surrounding shell function, if any;
normally these options are turned off in all emulation modes except
<strong>ksh*/. The /</strong>-L*/ switch is mutually exclusive with the/ use of *-c*/
in flags./</p>
<p>
If there is a single argument and the *-l*/ switch is given, the/
options that would be set or unset (the latter indicated with the
prefix `*no*/&#39;) are listed. <em><strong>-l</strong></em> can be combined with <em><strong>-L</strong></em> or
<em><strong>-R</strong></em> and/ the list will be modified in the appropriate way. Note the
list does not depend on the current setting of options, i.e. it
includes all options that may in principle change, not just those that
would actually change.</p>
<p>
The <em>flags may be any of the invocation-time flags described in</em> the
section INVOCATION in <em>zsh(1),</em> except that `*-o EMACS*/&#39; and `/*-o
VI*/&#39; may not be used. Flags such/ as `*+r*/&#39;<em>`/*+o RESTRICTED*</em>&#39; may
be prohibited in some circumstances./</p>
<p>
If *-c*/ arg appears in flags, arg is evaluated while the/ requested
emulation is temporarily in effect. In this case the emulation mode
and all options are restored to their previous values before
<strong>emulate*/ returns. The /</strong>-R*/ switch may precede the name of the
shell/ to emulate; note this has a meaning distinct from including
*-R*/ in/ <em>flags.</em></p>
<p>
Use of *-c*/ enables `sticky&#39; emulation mode for functions defined/
within the evaluated expression: the emulation mode is associated
thereafter with the function so that whenever the function is executed
the emulation (respecting the *-R*/ switch, if present) and all/
options are set (and pattern disables cleared) before entry to the
function, and the state is restored after exit. If the function is
called when the sticky emulation is already in effect, either within
an `*emulate*/ shell <em><strong>-c</strong></em>&#39; expression or/ within another function
with the same sticky emulation, entry and exit from the function do
not cause options to be altered (except due to standard processing
such as the *LOCAL_OPTIONS*/ option). This also/ applies to functions
marked for autoload within the sticky emulation; the appropriate set
of options will be applied at the point the function is loaded as well
as when it is run.</p>
<p>
For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
emulate sh -c &#39;fni() { setopt cshnullglob; }
fno() { fni; }&#39;
fno
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The two functions <strong>fni*/ and <em><strong>fno</strong></em> are defined with sticky /*sh</strong>
emulation. *fno*/ is then executed, causing options associated/ with
emulations to be set to their values in <strong>sh*/. <em><strong>fno</strong></em> then/ calls
*fni*/; because <em><strong>fni</strong></em> is also marked for sticky /*sh</strong> emulation, no
option changes take place on entry to or exit from it. Hence the
option *cshnullglob*/, turned off by <em><strong>sh</strong></em> emulation, will/ be turned
on within *fni*/ and remain on return to <em><strong>fno</strong></em>. On exit/ from
*fno*/, the emulation mode and all options will be restored to the/
state they were in before entry to the temporary emulation.</p>
<p>
The documentation above is typically sufficient for the intended
purpose of executing code designed for other shells in a suitable
environment. More detailed rules follow.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
1.
</dt>
<dd>The sticky emulation environment provided by `*emulate* <em>shell
/*-c*</em>&#39; is identical to that provided by entry to/ a function marked
for sticky emulation as a consequence of being defined in such an
environment. Hence, for example, the sticky emulation is inherited
by subfunctions defined within functions with sticky emulation.</dd>
<dt>
2.
</dt>
<dd>No change of options takes place on entry to or exit from
functions that are not marked for sticky emulation, other than those
that would normally take place, even if those functions are called
within sticky emulation.</dd>
<dt>
3.
</dt>
<dd>No special handling is provided for functions marked for
*autoload*/ nor for functions present in wordcode created by/ the
*zcompile*/ command./</dd>
<dt>
4.
</dt>
<dd>The presence or absence of the <strong>-R*/ switch to /*emulate</strong>
corresponds to different sticky emulation modes, so for example
`*emulate sh -c*/&#39;, `/*emulate -R sh -c*/&#39; and `/*emulate csh -c*/&#39;/
are treated as three distinct sticky emulations.</dd>
<dt>
5.
</dt>
<dd>Difference in shell options supplied in addition to the basic
emulation also mean the sticky emulations are different, so for
example `*emulate zsh -c*/&#39; and `/*emulate zsh -o cbases -c*/&#39; are/
treated as distinct sticky emulations.</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>The first two forms of this command select a range of events from <em>first
to last from the history list. The arguments first</em> and <em>last may be
specified as a number or as a string. A negative</em> number is used as an
offset to the current history event number. A string specifies the most
recent event beginning with the given string. All substitutions
<em>old/*=*/new, if any, are then performed on the</em> text of the events.</p>
<p>
The range of events selected by numbers can be narrowed further by the

<strong>-I</strong>

<dt>
<strong>-m</strong>
</dt>
<dd>takes the first argument as a pattern (which should be quoted)
and only the history events matching this pattern are considered</dd>
</dl>
<p>If <em>first is not specified, it will be set to -1 (the most recent</em>
event), or to -16 if the *-l*/ flag is given./ If <em>last is not
specified, it will be set to first,</em> or to -1 if the *-l*/ flag is
given./ However, if the current event has added entries to the history
with `*print -s*/&#39; or `/*fc -R*/&#39;, then the default last for /*-l*
includes all new history entries since the current event began.</p>
<p>
When the *-l*/ flag is given, the resulting events are listed on/
standard output. Otherwise the editor program specified by *-e*/ ename/
is invoked on a file containing these history events. If *-e*/ is not

<p>`*fc -p*/&#39; pushes the current history list onto a stack and switches to
a/ new history list. If the *-a*/ option is also specified, this history
list/ will be automatically popped when the current function scope is
exited, which is a much better solution than creating a trap function to
call `*fc -P*/&#39;/ manually. If no arguments are specified, the history
list is left empty, *$HISTFILE*/ is unset, and /*$HISTSIZE*/ &amp;
<em><strong>$SAVEHIST</strong></em> are set to their/ default values. If one argument is
given, *$HISTFILE*/ is set to that/ filename, *$HISTSIZE*/ &amp;
<em><strong>$SAVEHIST</strong></em> are left unchanged, and the history/ file is read in (if
it exists) to initialize the new list. If a second argument is
specified, *$HISTSIZE*/ &amp; /*$SAVEHIST*/ are instead set to the/ single
specified numeric value. Finally, if a third argument is specified,
*$SAVEHIST*/ is set to a separate value from /*$HISTSIZE*/. You are free
to/ change these environment values for the new history list however you
desire in order to manipulate the new history list.</p>
<p>
`*fc -P*/&#39; pops the history list back to an older list saved by `/*fc
-p*/&#39;./ The current list is saved to its *$HISTFILE*/ before it is
destroyed/ (assuming that *$HISTFILE*/ and <em><strong>$SAVEHIST</strong></em> are set
appropriately, of/ course). The values of *$HISTFILE*/, /*$HISTSIZE*/,
and <em><strong>$SAVEHIST</strong></em> are/ restored to the values they had when `*fc -p*/&#39;
was called. Note that this/ restoration can conflict with making these
variables &#34;local&#34;, so your best bet is to avoid local declarations for
these variables in functions that use `*fc -p*/&#39;. The one other
guaranteed-safe combination is declaring these/ variables to be local at
the top of your function and using the automatic option (*-a*/) with
`/*fc -p*/&#39;. Finally, note that it is legal to manually/ pop a push
marked for automatic popping if you need to do so before the function
exits.</p>
<p>
`*fc -R*/&#39; reads the history from the given file,/ `*fc -W*/&#39; writes the
history out to the given file,/ and `*fc -A*/&#39; appends the history out
to the given file./ If no filename is specified, the <strong>$HISTFILE*/ is
assumed./ If the *-I*/ option is added to /</strong>-R*/, only those events that
are/ not already contained within the internal history list are added.
If the <strong>-I*/ option is added to /</strong>-A*/ or <em><strong>-W</strong></em>, only those/ events
that are new since last incremental append/write to the history file are
appended/written. In any case, the created file will have no more than

<p>The *-x*/ option indicates that any functions output will have/ each

<p>
The *-W*/ option turns on the option <em><strong>WARN_NESTED_VAR</strong></em> for the named/
function or functions only. The option is turned off at the start of
nested functions (apart from anonoymous functions) unless the called
function also has the *-W*/ attribute./</p>
<p>
The *-c*/ option causes oldfn to be copied to newfn. The/ copy is
efficiently handled internally by reference counting. If <em>oldfn was
marked for autoload it is first loaded and if this</em> fails the copy
fails. Either function may subsequently be redefined without affecting
the other. A typical idiom is that <em>oldfn is the</em> name of a library
shell function which is then redefined to call *newfn*/, thereby
installing a modified version of the function./</p>
<p>
<em>The /*-M*</em> and <em><strong>+M</strong></em> flags/</p>
<p>
Use of the *-M*/ option may not be combined with any of the options/
handled by *typeset -f*/./</p>
<p>
*functions -M*/ mathfn defines mathfn as the name of/ a mathematical
function recognised in all forms of arithmetical expressions; see the
section `Arithmetic Evaluation&#39; in <em>zshmisc(1). By default mathfn may
take</em> any number of comma-separated arguments. If <em>min is given,</em> it
must have exactly <em>min args; if min and max are</em> both given, it must
have at least <em>min and at most max</em> args. <em>max may be -1 to indicate
that there is no upper limit.</em></p>
<p>
By default the function is implemented by a shell function of the same
name; if <em>shellfn is specified it gives the name of the corresponding</em>
shell function while <em>mathfn remains the name used in arithmetical</em>
expressions. The name of the function in *$0*/ is mathfn (not/ <em>shellfn
as would usually be the case), provided the option</em> *FUNCTION_ARGZERO*/
is in effect. The positional parameters in the shell/ function
correspond to the arguments of the mathematical function call.</p>
<p>
The result of the last arithmetical expression evaluated inside the
shell function gives the result of the mathematical function. This is
not limited to arithmetic substitutions of the form <strong>$((*/…/</strong>))*/,/
but also includes arithmetical expressions evaluated in any other way,
including by the <strong>let*/ builtin,/ by *((*/…/</strong>))*/ statements,/ and
even by the *return*/ builtin/ and by array subscripts. Therefore, care
must be taken not to use syntactical constructs that perform arithmetic
evaluation after evaluating what is to be the result of the function.
For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# WRONG
zmath_cube() {
  (( $1 * $1 * $1 ))
  return 0
}
functions -M cube 1 1 zmath_cube
print $(( cube(3) ))
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This will print `*0*/&#39; because of the <em><strong>return</strong></em>./</p>
<p>
Commenting the <strong>return*/ out would lead to a different problem: the/
*((*/…/</strong>))*/ statement would become/ the last statement in the
function, so the <em>return status (/*$?*</em>) of the/ function would be
non-zero (indicating failure) whenever the <em>arithmetic</em> result/ of the
function would happen to be zero (numerically):/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# WRONG
zmath_cube() {
  (( $1 * $1 * $1 ))
}
functions -M cube 1 1 zmath_cube
print $(( cube(0) ))
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Instead, the *true*/ builtin can be used:/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# RIGHT
zmath_cube() {
  (( $1 * $1 * $1 ))
  true
}
functions -M cube 1 1 zmath_cube
print $(( cube(3) ))
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If the additional option *-s*/ is given to <em><strong>functions -M</strong></em>, the/
argument to the function is a single string: anything between the
opening and matching closing parenthesis is passed to the function as a
single argument, even if it includes commas or white space. The minimum
and maximum argument specifiers must therefore be 1 if given. An empty
argument list is passed as a zero-length string. Thus, the following
string function takes a single argument, including the commas, and
prints 11:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
stringfn() { (( $#1 )); true }
functions -Ms stringfn
print $(( stringfn(foo,bar,rod) ))
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
*functions -M*/ with no arguments lists all such user-defined functions
in/ the same form as a definition. With the additional option *-m*/ and/
a list of arguments, all functions whose <em>mathfn matches one of</em> the
pattern arguments are listed.</p>
<p>
*function +M*/ removes the list of mathematical functions; with the/
additional option *-m*/ the arguments are treated as patterns and/ all
functions whose <em>mathfn matches the pattern are removed. Note</em> that the
shell function implementing the behaviour is not removed (regardless of
whether its name coincides with <em>mathfn).</em></p>

Given no arguments, and neither the <strong>-r*/ or /</strong>-f*/ options,/ the
selected hash table will be listed in full.

The *-r*/ option causes the selected hash table to be emptied./ It
will be subsequently rebuilt in the normal fashion. The *-f*/ option
causes the selected hash table to be fully/ rebuilt immediately. For
the command hash table this hashes all the absolute directories in the
*PATH*/,/ and for the named directory hash table this adds all users&#39;
home directories. These two options cannot be used with any arguments.

The *-m*/ option causes the arguments to be taken as patterns/ (which
should be quoted) and the elements of the hash table matching those
patterns are printed. This is the only way to display a limited
selection of hash table elements.

For each <em>name with a corresponding value, put `name&#39; in</em> the selected
hash table, associating it with the pathname `/value&#39;./ In the command
hash table, this means that whenever `/name&#39; is used as a command
argument, the shell will try/ to execute the file given by `/value&#39;./
In the named directory hash table, this means that `/value&#39; may be
referred to as `/*~*/name&#39;./

For each <em>name with no</em> corresponding <em>value, attempt to add name to
the hash table,</em> checking what the appropriate *value*/ is in the
normal manner for/ that hash table. If an appropriate *value*/ can&#39;t
be found, then/ the hash table will be unchanged.

The *-v*/ option causes hash table entries to be listed as they are/
added by explicit specification. If has no effect if used with *-f*/./

If the *-L*/ flag is present, then each hash table entry is printed
in/ the form of a call to hash.</dd>

<p>
Full job control is only available in the top-level interactive shell,

processes are created within the subshell, then instead information
about those processes is provided.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="example">

<strong>printf*/ [ /</strong>-v*/ name ] format [ arg … ]/

<dd>Print the arguments
according to the format specification. Formatting rules are the same
as used in C. The same escape sequences as for <strong>echo</strong> are recognised
in the format. All C conversion specifications ending in one of
*csdiouxXeEfgGn*/ are handled. In addition to this, `/*%b*/&#39; can be/
used instead of `*%s*/&#39; to cause escape sequences in the argument to
be/ recognised and `*%q*/&#39; can be used to quote the argument in such a
way/ that allows it to be reused as shell input. With the numeric
format specifiers, if the corresponding argument starts with a quote
character, the numeric value of the following character is used as the
number to print; otherwise the argument is evaluated as an arithmetic
expression. See the section `Arithmetic Evaluation&#39; in <em>zshmisc(1)</em>
for a description of arithmetic expressions. With `*%n*/&#39;, the
corresponding argument is taken as an/ identifier which is created as
an integer parameter.

Normally, conversion specifications are applied to each argument in
order but they can explicitly specify the <em>nth argument is to be used
by</em> replacing `*%*/&#39; by `/*%*/n/*$*/&#39; and `/***/&#39; by `/***/n/*$*/&#39;./
It is recommended that you do not mix references of this explicit
style with the normal style and the handling of such mixed styles may
be subject to future change.

If arguments remain unused after formatting, the format string is
reused until all arguments have been consumed. With the *print*/
builtin, this/ can be suppressed by using the *-r*/ option. If more
arguments are/ required by the format than have been specified, the
behaviour is as if zero or an empty string had been specified as the
argument.

The *-v*/ option causes the output to be stored as the value of the/
parameter <em>name, instead of printed. If name is an array and</em> the
format string is reused when consuming arguments then one array
element will be used for each use of the format string.</dd>

within this time. If <em>num is not present, it is taken to be zero, so
that</em> *read*/ returns immediately if no input is available./ If no
input is available, return status 1 and do not set any variables. This
option is not available when reading from the editor buffer with
<strong>-z*/, when called from within completion with /</strong>-c*/ or <em><strong>-l</strong></em>, with/
*-q*/ which clears the input queue before reading, or within zle
where/ other mechanisms should be used to test for input. Note that
read does not attempt to alter the input processing mode. The default
mode is canonical input, in which an entire line is read at a time, so
usually `*read -t*/&#39; will not read anything until an entire line has/
been typed. However, when reading from the terminal with <strong>-k</strong> input is
processed one key at a time; in this case, only availability of the
first character is tested, so that e.g. `*read -t -k 2*/&#39; can still/
block on the second character. Use two instances of `*read -t -k*/&#39;
if/ this is not what is wanted.</dd>

*trap*/ [ arg ] [ sig … ]/
</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>arg is a series of commands (usually
quoted to protect it from</em> immediate evaluation by the shell) to be
read and executed when the shell receives any of the signals specified
by one or more <em>sig args.</em> Each <em>sig can be given as a number,</em> or as
the name of a signal either with or without the string <strong>SIG</strong> in front
(e.g. 1, HUP, and SIGHUP are all the same signal).</p>
<p>
If <em>arg is `/*-*</em>&#39;, then the specified signals are reset to their/
defaults, or, if no <em>sig args are present, all traps are reset.</em></p>
<p>
If <em>arg is an empty string, then the specified signals</em> are ignored by
the shell (and by the commands it invokes).</p>
<p>
If <em>arg is omitted but one or more sig args are provided (i.e.</em> the
first argument is a valid signal number or name), the effect is the
same as if <em>arg had been specified as `/*-*</em>&#39;./</p>
<p>
The *trap*/ command with no arguments prints a list of commands/
associated with each signal.</p>
<p>
If <em>sig is /*ZERR*</em> then arg will be executed/ after each command with
a nonzero exit status. *ERR*/ is an alias/ for *ZERR*/ on systems that
have no <em><strong>SIGERR</strong></em> signal (this is the/ usual case).</p>
<p>
If <em>sig is /*DEBUG*</em> then arg will be executed/ before each command if
the option *DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD*/ is set/ (as it is by default), else
after each command. Here, a `command&#39; is what is described as a
`sublist&#39; in the shell grammar, see the section SIMPLE COMMANDS &amp;
PIPELINES in <em>zshmisc(1).</em> If *DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD*/ is set various
additional features are available./ First, it is possible to skip the
next command by setting the option *ERR_EXIT*/; see the description of
the <em><strong>ERR_EXIT</strong></em> option in/ <em>zshoptions(1). Also, the shell parameter</em>
*ZSH_DEBUG_CMD*/ is set to the string corresponding to the command/ to
be executed following the trap. Note that this string is reconstructed
from the internal format and may not be formatted the same way as the
original text. The parameter is unset after the trap is executed.</p>
<p>
If <em>sig is /*0*</em> or <em><strong>EXIT</strong> and the <strong>trap</strong></em> statement is executed
inside the body of a function,/ then the command <em>arg is executed
after the function completes.</em> The value of *$?*/ at the start of
execution is the exit status of the/ shell or the return status of the
function exiting. If <em>sig is /*0*</em> or <em><strong>EXIT</strong> and the <strong>trap</strong></em>
statement is not executed inside the body of a function,/ then the
command <em>arg is executed when the shell terminates; the</em> trap runs
before any *zshexit*/ hook functions./</p>
<p>
*ZERR*/, <em><strong>DEBUG</strong></em>, and <em><strong>EXIT</strong></em> traps are not executed inside other/
traps. *ZERR*/ and <em><strong>DEBUG</strong></em> traps are kept within subshells, while/
other traps are reset.</p>
<p>
Note that traps defined with the *trap*/ builtin are slightly
different/ from those defined as `*TRAP*/NAL () { … }&#39;, as the
latter have/ their own function environment (line numbers, local
variables, etc.) while the former use the environment of the command
in which they were called. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
trap &#39;print $LINENO&#39; DEBUG
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
will print the line number of a command executed after it has run,
while</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
TRAPDEBUG() { print $LINENO; }
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
will always print the number zero.</p>
<p>
Alternative signal names are allowed as described under *kill*/
above./ Defining a trap under either name causes any trap under an
alternative name to be removed. However, it is recommended that for
consistency users stick exclusively to one name or another.</p>

<dd>The *-f*/ option freezes the tty (i.e.

the tty does not cause the current state to be remembered: instead, it
causes future changes to the state to be blocked.

Without options it reports whether the terminal is frozen or not.

Note that, regardless of whether the tty is frozen or not, the shell
needs to change the settings when the line editor starts, so
unfreezing the tty does not guarantee settings made on the command
line are preserved. Strings of commands run between editing the
command line will see a consistent tty state. See also the shell

Set or display attributes and values for shell parameters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Except as noted below for control flags that change the behavior, a
parameter is created for each <em>name that does not already refer</em> to one.
When inside a function, a new parameter is created for every <em>name (even
those that already exist), and is unset again when the</em> function
completes. See `Local Parameters&#39; in <em>zshparam(1). The same rules apply
to special shell parameters, which</em> retain their special attributes when
made local.</p>
<p>
For each <em>name/*=*/value assignment, the parameter</em> <em>name is set to
value. If the assignment is omitted and name</em> does <em>not refer to an
existing parameter, a new parameter is intialized</em> to empty string,
zero, or empty array (as appropriate), <em>unless the</em> shell option
*TYPESET_TO_UNSET*/ is set. When that option is set,/ the parameter
attributes are recorded but the parameter remains unset.</p>
<p>
If the shell option *TYPESET_SILENT*/ is not set, for each remaining/
<em>name that refers to a parameter that is already set, the name and</em>
value of the parameter are printed in the form of an assignment. Nothing
is printed for newly-created parameters, or when any attribute flags
listed below are given along with the <em>name. Using</em> `*+*/&#39; instead of
minus to introduce an attribute turns it off./</p>
<p>
If no <em>name is present, the names and values of all parameters are</em>
printed. In this case the attribute flags restrict the display to only
those parameters that have the specified attributes, and using `*+*/&#39;/
rather than `*-*/&#39; to introduce the flag suppresses printing of the
values/ of parameters when there is no parameter name.</p>
<p>
All forms of the command handle scalar assignment. Array assignment is
possible if any of the reserved words *declare*/, <em><strong>export</strong></em>,
<em><strong>float</strong></em>,/ *integer*/, <em><strong>local</strong></em>, <em><strong>readonly</strong></em> or <em><strong>typeset</strong></em> is
matched when the/ line is parsed (N.B. not when it is executed). In this
case the arguments are parsed as assignments, except that the `*+=*/&#39;
syntax and the/ <strong>GLOB_ASSIGN*/ option are not supported, and scalar
values after /*=</strong> are <em>not split further into words, even if expanded
(regardless of the</em> setting of the *KSH_TYPESET*/ option; this option is
obsolete)./</p>
<p>
Examples of the differences between command and reserved word parsing:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# Reserved word parsing
typeset svar=$(echo one word) avar=(several words)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The above creates a scalar parameter *svar*/ and an array/ parameter
*avar*/ as if the assignments had been/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
svar=&#34;one word&#34;
avar=(several words)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
On the other hand:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# Normal builtin interface
builtin typeset svar=$(echo two words)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The *builtin*/ keyword causes the above to use the standard builtin/
interface to <strong>typeset*/ in which argument parsing is performed in the
same/ way as for other commands. This example creates a scalar *svar</strong>
containing the value *two*/ and another scalar parameter <em><strong>words</strong></em> with/
no value. An array value in this case would either cause an error or be
treated as an obscure set of glob qualifiers.</p>
<p>
Arbitrary arguments are allowed if they take the form of assignments
after command line expansion; however, these only perform scalar
assignment:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
var=&#39;svar=val&#39;
typeset $var
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The above sets the scalar parameter *svar*/ to the value <em><strong>val</strong></em>./
Parentheses around the value within <strong>var*/ would not cause array/
assignment as they will be treated as ordinary characters when *$var</strong> is
substituted. Any non-trivial expansion in the name part of the
assignment causes the argument to be treated in this fashion:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
typeset {var1,var2,var3}=name
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The above syntax is valid, and has the expected effect of setting the
three parameters to the same value, but the command line is parsed as a
set of three normal command line arguments to *typeset*/ after/
expansion. Hence it is not possible to assign to multiple arrays by this
means.</p>
<p>
Note that each interface to any of the commands may be disabled
separately. For example, `*disable -r typeset*/&#39; disables the reserved/
word interface to *typeset*/, exposing the builtin interface, while/
`*disable typeset*/&#39; disables the builtin. Note that disabling the/
reserved word interface for *typeset*/ may cause problems with the/
output of `*typeset -p*/&#39;, which assumes the reserved word interface is/
available in order to restore array and associative array values.</p>
<p>
Unlike parameter assignment statements, *typeset*/&#39;s exit status on an/
assignment that involves a command substitution does not reflect the
exit status of the command substitution. Therefore, to test for an error
in a command substitution, separate the declaration of the parameter
from its initialization:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# WRONG
typeset var1=$(exit 1) || echo &#34;Trouble with var1&#34;

# RIGHT
typeset var1 &amp;&amp; var1=$(exit 1) || echo &#34;Trouble with var1&#34;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
To initialize a parameter <em>param to a command output and mark it
readonly,</em> use *typeset -r */param or <em>*readonly */param after the
parameter</em> assignment statement.</p>
<p>
If no attribute flags are given, and either no <em>name arguments are</em>
present or the flag *+m*/ is used, then each parameter name printed is/
preceded by a list of the attributes of that parameter (*array*/,/
*association*/, <em><strong>exported</strong></em>, <em><strong>float</strong></em>, <em><strong>integer</strong></em>, <em><strong>readonly</strong></em>,/ or
*undefined*/ for autoloaded parameters not yet loaded). If <em><strong>+m</strong></em> is/
used with attribute flags, and all those flags are introduced with *+*/,
the matching parameter names are printed but their values/ are not.</p>
<p>
The following control flags change the behavior of *typeset*/:/</p>
<p>
<strong>+</strong> If `*+*/&#39; appears by itself in a separate word as the last option,/
then the names of all parameters (functions with *-f*/) are printed,
but/ the values (function bodies) are not. No <em>name arguments may
appear,</em> and it is an error for any other options to follow `*+*/&#39;. The/
effect of `*+*/&#39; is as if all attribute flags which precede it were/
given with a `*+*/&#39; prefix. For example, `/*typeset -U +*/&#39; is/
equivalent to `*typeset +U*/&#39; and displays the names of all arrays
having/ the uniqueness attribute, whereas `*typeset -f -U +*/&#39; displays
the/ names of all autoloadable functions. If *+*/ is the only option,/
then type information (array, readonly, etc.) is also printed for each

<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-g</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The *-g*/ (global) means that any resulting parameter will not
be/ restricted to local scope. Note that this does not necessarily
mean that the parameter will be global, as the flag will apply to any
existing parameter (even if unset) from an enclosing function. This

created in this fashion is shown. With two or three arguments, the
first two are the name of a scalar and of an array parameter (in that
order) that will be tied together in the manner of *$PATH*/ and
/*$path*/. The optional third/ argument is a single-character
separator which will be used to join the elements of the array to form
the scalar; if absent, a colon is used, as with *$PATH*/. Only the
first character of the separator is significant;/ any remaining
characters are ignored. Multibyte characters are not yet supported.

Only one of the scalar and array parameters may be assigned an initial
value (the restrictions on assignment forms described above also
apply).

Both the scalar and the array may be manipulated as normal. If one is
unset, the other will automatically be unset too. There is no way of
untying the variables without unsetting them, nor of converting the
type of one of them with another *typeset*/ command; <em><strong>+T</strong></em> does not
work,/ assigning an array to <em>scalar is an error, and assigning a
scalar to</em> <em>array sets it to be a single-element array.</em>

Note that both `*typeset -xT …*/&#39; and `/*export -T …*/&#39; work, but/
only the scalar will be marked for export. Setting the value using the
scalar version causes a split on all separators (which cannot be
quoted). It is possible to apply *-T*/ to two previously tied
variables but with a/ different separator character, in which case the
variables remain joined as before but the separator is changed.

When an existing scalar is tied to a new array, the value of the
scalar is preserved but no attribute other than export will be

when the parameter is expanded. If <em>n is nonzero, it defines the width
of the field.</em> If <em>n is zero, the width is determined by the width of

the length of the complete value assigned to the parameter is used to
determine the width, not the value that would be output.

The width is the count of characters, which may be multibyte
characters if the *MULTIBYTE*/ option is in effect. Note that the
screen/ width of the character is not taken into account; if this is
required, use padding with parameter expansion flags
<strong>${(ml*/…/</strong>)*/…/*}*/ as described in/ `Parameter Expansion Flags&#39;
in <em>zshexpn(1).</em>

When the parameter is expanded, it is filled on the right with blanks
or truncated if necessary to fit the field. Note truncation can lead

<dd>For arrays (but not for associative arrays), keep only the

tied parameters (see *-T*/) or colon-separated special parameters
like/ *PATH*/ or <em><strong>FIGNORE</strong></em>, etc. Note the flag takes effect on
assignment,/ and the type of the variable being assigned to is
determinative; for variables with shared values it is therefore
recommended to set the flag for all interfaces, e.g. `*typeset -U PATH
path*/&#39;./

This flag has a different meaning when used with *-f*/; see below./</dd>
<dt>
*-Z*/ [ n ]/
</dt>
<dd>Specially handled if set along with the *-L*/ flag./
Otherwise, similar to *-R*/, except that leading zeros are used for/
padding instead of blanks if the first non-blank character is a digit.
Numeric parameters are specially handled: they are always eligible for
padding with zeroes, and the zeroes are inserted at an appropriate
place in the output.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-a</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The names refer to array parameters. An array parameter may be
created this way, but it may be assigned to in the <strong>typeset</strong> statement
only if the reserved word form of *typeset*/ is enabled/ (as it is by
default). When displaying, both normal and associative arrays are
shown.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-f</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The names refer to functions rather than parameters. No
assignments can be made, and the only other valid flags are <strong>-t*/,
/</strong>-T*/, <em><strong>-k</strong></em>,/ <strong>-u*/, /</strong>-U*/ and <em><strong>-z</strong></em>. The flag <em><strong>-t</strong></em> turns on
execution tracing/ for this function; the flag *-T*/ does the same,
but turns off tracing/ for any named (not anonymous) function called
from the present one, unless that function also has the <strong>-t*/ or
/</strong>-T*/ flag. The <em><strong>-u</strong></em> and <em><strong>-U</strong></em> flags cause the/ function to be
marked for autoloading; *-U*/ also causes alias/ expansion to be
suppressed when the function is loaded. See the description of the
`*autoload*/&#39; builtin for details./

Note that the builtin *functions*/ provides the same basic
capabilities/ as <strong>typeset -f*/ but gives access to a few extra
options; /*autoload</strong> gives further additional options for the case
*typeset -fu*/ and/ *typeset -fU*/./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-h</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Hide: only useful for special parameters (those marked `&lt;S&gt;&#39;
in the table in <em>zshparam(1)), and for local parameters with the same
name as a special parameter,</em> though harmless for others. A special
parameter with this attribute will not retain its special effect when
made local. Thus after `*typeset -h* PATH/&#39;, a function containing
`/*typeset PATH*/&#39; will create an ordinary/ local parameter without
the usual behaviour of *PATH*/. Alternatively,/ the local parameter
may itself be given this attribute; hence inside a function `*typeset
-h PATH*/&#39; creates an ordinary local parameter and the/ special
*PATH*/ parameter is not altered in any way. It is also possible/ to
create a local parameter using `*typeset +h */special&#39;, where the/
local copy of <em>special will retain its special properties regardless
of</em> having the *-h*/ attribute. Global special parameters loaded from
shell/ modules (currently those in *zsh/mapfile*/ and
<em><strong>zsh/parameter</strong></em>) are/ automatically given the *-h*/ attribute to
avoid name clashes./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-H</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Hide value: specifies that *typeset*/ will not display the
value of the/ parameter when listing parameters; the display for such
parameters is always as if the `*+*/&#39; flag had been given. Use of the
parameter is/ in other respects normal, and the option does not apply
if the parameter is specified by name, or by pattern with the *-m*/
option. This is on by/ default for the parameters in the
<strong>zsh/parameter*/ and /*zsh/mapfile</strong> modules. Note, however, that
unlike the *-h*/ flag this is also useful/ for non-special parameters.</dd>
<dt>
*-i*/ [ n ]/
</dt>
<dd>Use an internal integer representation. If <em>n is

determined by the first assignment. Bases from 2 to 36 inclusive are
allowed.</dd>
<dt>
*-E*/ [ n ]/
</dt>
<dd>Use an internal double-precision floating point
representation. On output the variable will be converted to scientific
notation. If <em>n is</em> nonzero it defines the number of significant
figures to display; the default is ten.</dd>
<dt>
*-F*/ [ n ]/
</dt>
<dd>Use an internal double-precision floating point
representation. On output the variable will be converted to
fixed-point decimal notation. If <em>n</em> is nonzero it defines the number
of digits to display after the decimal point; the default is ten.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-l</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Convert the result to lower case whenever the parameter is
expanded. The value is <em>not converted when assigned.</em></dd>
<dt>
<strong>-r</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The given <em>names are marked readonly. Note that if name is a</em>
special parameter, the readonly attribute can be turned on, but cannot
then be turned off.

If the *POSIX_BUILTINS*/ option is set, the readonly attribute is/
more restrictive: unset variables can be marked readonly and cannot
then be set; furthermore, the readonly attribute cannot be removed
from any variable.

It is still possible to change other attributes of the variable
though, some of which like <strong>-U*/ or /</strong>-Z*/ would affect the value.
More generally,/ the readonly attribute should not be relied on as a
security mechanism.

Note that in zsh (like in pdksh but unlike most other shells) it is
still possible to create a local variable of the same name as this is
considered a different variable (though this variable, too, can be
marked readonly). Special variables that have been made readonly
retain their value and readonly attribute when made local.</dd>
<dt>

<dd>Mark for automatic export to the environment of subsequently
executed commands. If the option *GLOBAL_EXPORT*/ is set, this

argument must be quoted to prevent it from being expanded before being

suffix aliases./ The <strong>-f*/ option causes/ *unhash*/ to remove shell
functions. The /</strong>-d*/ options causes/ <strong>unhash*/ to remove named

Individual elements of associative array parameters may be unset by

If the *-m*/ flag is specified the arguments are taken as patterns

Note that this cannot be used when unsetting associative array
elements, as the subscript will be treated as part of the pattern.

The *-v*/ flag specifies that name refers to parameters. This is the/

<li>*wait*/ [ job … ]/ :: Wait for the specified jobs or processes. If
<em>job is not given</em> then all currently active child processes are
waited for. Each <em>job can be either a job specification or the process
ID</em> of a job in the job table. The exit status from this command is
that of the job waited for. If <em>job represents an unknown job or
process ID, a warning is printed</em> (unless the *POSIX_BUILTINS*/ option
is set) and the exit status is 127./

It is possible to wait for recent processes (specified by process ID,
not by job) that were running in the background even if the process
has exited. Typically the process ID will be recorded by capturing the
value of the variable *$!*/ immediately after the process has been/
started. There is a limit on the number of process IDs remembered by
the shell; this is given by the value of the system configuration
parameter *CHILD_MAX*/. When this limit is reached, older process IDs/
are discarded, least recently started processes first.

Note there is no protection against the process ID wrapping, i.e. if
the wait is not executed soon enough there is a chance the process
waited for is the wrong one. A conflict implies both process IDs have
been generated by the shell, as other processes are not recorded, and
that the user is potentially interested in both, so this problem is
intrinsic to process IDs.</li>

<p>
*zcompile -t*/ file [ name … ]/ This builtin command can be used to
compile functions or scripts, storing the compiled form in a file, and
to examine files containing the compiled form. This allows faster
autoloading of functions and sourcing of scripts by avoiding parsing of
the text when the files are read.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first form (without the <strong>-c*/, /</strong>-a*/ or <em><strong>-t</strong></em> options) creates a/
compiled file. If only the <em>file argument is given, the</em> output file has
the name `/file/*.zwc*/&#39; and will be placed in/ the same directory as
the <em>file. The shell will load the compiled</em> file instead of the normal
function file when the function is autoloaded; see the section
`Autoloading Functions&#39; in <em>zshmisc(1)</em> for a description of how
autoloaded functions are searched. The extension *.zwc*/ stands for `zsh
word code&#39;./</p>
<p>
If there is at least one <em>name argument, all the named files</em> are
compiled into the output <em>file given as the first argument. If</em> <em>file
does not end in /*.zwc*</em>, this extension is automatically/ appended.
Files containing multiple compiled functions are called `digest&#39; files,
and are intended to be used as elements of the <strong>FPATH*///*fpath</strong> special
array.</p>
<p>
The second form, with the <strong>-c*/ or /</strong>-a*/ options, writes the compiled/
definitions for all the named functions into <em>file. For /*-c*</em>, the/
names must be functions currently defined in the shell, not those marked
for autoloading. Undefined functions that are marked for autoloading may
be written by using the <strong>-a*/ option, in which case the /*fpath</strong> is
searched and the contents of the definition files for those functions,
if found, are compiled into <em>file. If both /*-c*</em> and/ *-a*/ are given,
names of both defined functions and functions marked/ for autoloading
may be given. In either case, the functions in files written with the
<strong>-c*/ or /</strong>-a*/ option will be autoloaded as if the/ *KSH_AUTOLOAD*/
option were unset./</p>
<p>
The reason for handling loaded and not-yet-loaded functions with
different options is that some definition files for autoloading define
multiple functions, including the function with the same name as the
file, and, at the end, call that function. In such cases the output of
`*zcompile -c*/&#39; does not include the additional functions defined in/
the file, and any other initialization code in the file is lost. Using
`*zcompile -a*/&#39; captures all this extra information./</p>
<p>
If the <strong>-m*/ option is combined with /</strong>-c*/ or <em><strong>-a</strong></em>,/ the <em>names are
used as patterns and all functions whose names</em> match one of these
patterns will be written. If no <em>name is given,</em> the definitions of all
functions currently defined or marked as autoloaded will be written.</p>
<p>
Note the second form cannot be used for compiling functions that include
redirections as part of the definition rather than within the body of
the function; for example</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
fn1() { { ... } &gt;~/logfile }
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
can be compiled but</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
fn1() { ... } &gt;~/logfile
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
cannot. It is possible to use the first form of *zcompile*/ to compile/
autoloadable functions that include the full function definition instead
of just the body of the function.</p>
<p>
The third form, with the *-t*/ option, examines an existing/ compiled
file. Without further arguments, the names of the original files
compiled into it are listed. The first line of output shows the version
of the shell which compiled the file and how the file will be used (i.e.
by reading it directly or by mapping it into memory). With arguments,
nothing is output and the return status is set to zero if definitions
for <em>all names were found in the compiled</em> file, and non-zero if the
definition for at least one <em>name was not</em> found.</p>
<p>
Other options:</p>
<p>
<strong>-U</strong> Aliases are not expanded when compiling the <em>named files.</em></p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-R</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When the compiled file is read, its contents are copied into
the shell&#39;s memory, rather than memory-mapped (see *-M*/). This/
happens automatically on systems that do not support memory mapping.

When compiling scripts instead of autoloadable functions, it is often
desirable to use this option; otherwise the whole file, including the
code to define functions which have already been defined, will remain
mapped, consequently wasting memory.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-M</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The compiled file is mapped into the shell&#39;s memory when read.
This is done in such a way that multiple instances of the shell
running on the same host will share this mapped file. If neither *-R*/
nor/ *-M*/ is given, the <em><strong>zcompile</strong></em> builtin decides what to do
based/ on the size of the compiled file.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>-k</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>-z</strong> These options are used when the compiled file contains functions
which are to be autoloaded. If *-z*/ is given, the/ function will be
autoloaded as if the *KSH_AUTOLOAD*/ option is/ <em>not set, even if it is
set at the time the compiled file is</em> read, while if the *-k*/ is given,
the function will be loaded as if/ <strong>KSH_AUTOLOAD*/ is set. These options
also take precedence over/ any *-k*/ or /</strong>-z*/ options specified to the
<em><strong>autoload</strong></em> builtin. If/ neither of these options is given, the
function will be loaded as determined by the setting of the
*KSH_AUTOLOAD*/ option at the time/ the compiled file is read. These
options may also appear as many times as necessary between the listed
<em>names to specify the loading style of all following functions, up to</em>
the next <strong>-k*/ or /</strong>-z*/./</p>
<p>
The created file always contains two versions of the compiled format,
one for big-endian machines and one for small-endian machines. The
upshot of this is that the compiled file is machine independent and if
it is read or mapped, only one half of the file is actually used (and
mapped).</p>

printed. The *-L*/ option causes this list to be in the form of a/
series of *zmodload*/ commands. Forms with arguments are:/</p>
<p>
<strong>zmodload*/ [ /</strong>-is*/ ] name … /</p>
<p>
<strong>zmodload*/ /</strong>-u*/ [ <em><strong>-i</strong></em> ] name …/ In the simplest case,
*zmodload*/ loads a binary module. The module must/ be in a file with a
name consisting of the specified <em>name followed by</em> a standard suffix,
usually `*.so*/&#39; (`/*.sl*/&#39; on HPUX)./ If the module to be loaded is
already loaded the duplicate module is ignored. If *zmodload*/ detects
an inconsistency, such as an/ invalid module name or circular dependency
list, the current code block is aborted. If it is available, the module
is loaded if necessary, while if it is not available, non-zero status is
silently returned. The option *-i*/ is accepted for compatibility but
has no effect./</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>named module is searched for in the same way a command is, using</em>
*$module_path*/ instead of /*$path*/. However, the path search is/
performed even when the module name contains a `*/*/&#39;, which it usually
does./ There is no way to prevent the path search.</p>
<p>
If the module supports features (see below), *zmodload*/ tries to/
enable all features when loading a module. If the module was

returns status 2./</p>
<p>
If the option *-s*/ is given, no error is printed if the module was not/
available (though other errors indicating a problem with the module are
printed). The return status indicates if the module was loaded. This is
appropriate if the caller considers the module optional.</p>
<p>
With *-u*/, <em><strong>zmodload</strong></em> unloads modules. The same name/ must be given
that was given when the module was loaded, but it is not necessary for
the module to exist in the file system. The *-i*/ option suppresses the
error if the module is already/ unloaded (or was never loaded).</p>

Each module has a boot and a cleanup function. The module will not be
loaded if its boot function fails. Similarly a module can only be
unloaded if its cleanup function runs successfully.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>zmodload -F*/ [ /</strong>-almLe*/ <em><strong>-P</strong></em> param ] module [ [/*+-*/]feature
… ]/ :: *zmodload -F*/ allows more selective control over the
features provided/ by modules. With no options apart from *-F*/, the
module named/ <em>module is loaded, if it was not already loaded, and the
list of</em> <em>features is set to the required state. If no / /features are
specified, the module is loaded, if it was not already</em> loaded, but
the state of features is unchanged. Each feature may be preceded by a
<strong>+*/ to turn the feature on, or /</strong>-*/ to turn it/ off; the *+*/ is
assumed if neither character is present./ Any feature not explicitly
mentioned is left in its current state; if the module was not
previously loaded this means any such features will remain disabled.
The return status is zero if all features were set, 1 if the module
failed to load, and 2 if some features could not be set (for example,
a parameter couldn&#39;t be added because there was a different parameter
of the same name) but the module was loaded.

The standard features are builtins, conditions, parameters and math
functions; these are indicated by the prefix `*b:*/&#39;, `/*c:*/&#39;/
(`*C:*/&#39; for an infix condition), `/*p:*/&#39; and `/*f:*/&#39;,
respectively,/ followed by the name that the corresponding feature
would have in the shell. For example, `*b:strftime*/&#39; indicates a
builtin named/ *strftime*/ and <em><strong>p:EPOCHSECONDS</strong></em> indicates a
parameter named/ *EPOCHSECONDS*/. The module may provide other
(`abstract&#39;) features of/ its own as indicated by its documentation;
these have no prefix.

With <strong>-l*/ or /</strong>-L*/, features provided by the module are listed.
With/ *-l*/ alone, a list of features together with their states is
shown, one/ feature per line. With *-L*/ alone, a <em><strong>zmodload -F</strong></em>
command that would/ cause enabled features of the module to be turned
on is shown. With *-lL*/, a <em><strong>zmodload -F</strong></em> command that would cause
all the features to be/ set to their current state is shown. If one of
these combinations is given with the option *-P*/ param then the
parameter param is set to an/ array of features, either features
together with their state or (if *-L*/ alone is given) enabled
features./

With the option *-L*/ the module name may be omitted; then a list/ of
all enabled features for all modules providing features is printed in
the form of <strong>zmodload -F*/ commands. If /</strong>-l*/ is also given,/ the
state of both enabled and disabled features is output in that form.

A set of features may be provided together with <strong>-l*/ or /</strong>-L*/ and a/
module name; in that case only the state of those features is
considered. Each feature may be preceded by <strong>+*/ or /</strong>-*/ but the/
character has no effect. If no set of features is provided, all
features are considered.

With *-e*/, the command first tests that the module is loaded;/ if it
is not, status 1 is returned. If the module is loaded, the list of
features given as an argument is examined. Any feature given with no
prefix is simply tested to see if the module provides it; any feature
given with a prefix <strong>+*/ or /</strong>-*/ is tested to/ see if is provided and
in the given state. If the tests on all features in the list succeed,
status 0 is returned, else status 1.

With *-m*/, each entry in the given list of features is taken/ as a
pattern to be matched against the list of features provided by the
module. An initial <strong>+*/ or /</strong>-*/ must be given explicitly./ This may
not be combined with the *-a*/ option as autoloads must/ be specified
explicitly.

With <strong>-a*/, the given list of features is marked for autoload from/
the specified module, which may not yet be loaded. An optional *+</strong> may
appear before the feature name. If the feature is prefixed with <strong>-*/,
any existing autoload is removed. The options /</strong>-l*/ and /*-L* may be
used to list autoloads. Autoloading is specific to individual
features; when the module is loaded only the requested feature is
enabled. Autoload requests are preserved if the module is subsequently
unloaded until an explicit `*zmodload -Fa*/ module/ *-*/feature&#39; is
issued. It is not an error to request an autoload/ for a feature of a
module that is already loaded.

When the module is loaded each autoload is checked against the
features actually provided by the module; if the feature is not
provided the autoload request is deleted. A warning message is output;
if the module is being loaded to provide a different feature, and that
autoload is successful, there is no effect on the status of the
current command. If the module is already loaded at the time when
*zmodload -Fa*/ is/ run, an error message is printed and status 1
returned.

<strong>zmodload -Fa*/ can be used with the /</strong>-l*/, <em><strong>-L</strong></em>, <em><strong>-e</strong></em> and/ *-P*/
options for listing and testing the existence of autoloadable/
features. In this case <strong>-l*/ is ignored if /</strong>-L*/ is specified./
*zmodload -FaL*/ with no module name lists autoloads for all modules./

Note that only standard features as described above can be autoloaded;
other features require the module to be loaded before enabling.</li>

to zero if all <em>strings given as arguments</em> are names of loaded
modules and to one if at least on <em>string is not</em> the name of a loaded

<dd>For
each argument, if both <em>modalias and module are given,</em> define
<em>modalias to be an alias for the module module.</em> If the module
<em>modalias is ever subsequently requested, either via a</em> call to
*zmodload*/ or implicitly, the shell will attempt to load/ <em>module
instead. If module is not given, show the definition of</em> <em>modalias. If
no arguments are given, list all defined module aliases.</em> When
listing, if the *-L*/ flag was also given, list the definition as a/
*zmodload*/ command to recreate the alias./

The existence of aliases for modules is completely independent of
whether the name resolved is actually loaded as a module: while the
alias exists, loading and unloading the module under any alias has
exactly the same effect as using the resolved name, and does not
affect the connection between the alias and the resolved name which
can be removed either by *zmodload -R*/ or by redefining the alias.
Chains of aliases (i.e. where/ the first resolved name is itself an
alias) are valid so long as these are not circular. As the aliases
take the same format as module names, they may include path
separators: in this case, there is no requirement for any part of the
path named to exist as the alias will be resolved first. For example,
`*any/old/alias*/&#39; is always a valid alias./

Dependencies added to aliased modules are actually added to the
resolved module; these remain if the alias is removed. It is valid to
create an alias whose name is one of the standard shell modules and
which resolves to a different module. However, if a module has
dependencies, it will not be possible to use the module name as an
alias as the module will already be marked as a loadable module in its
own right.

Apart from the above, aliases can be used in the *zmodload*/ command/
anywhere module names are required. However, aliases will not be shown
in lists of loaded modules with a bare `*zmodload*/&#39;./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>zmodload*/ /</strong>-R*/ modalias … /

<dd>For each <em>modalias argument that
was previously defined as a module</em> alias via *zmodload -A*/, delete
the alias. If any was not defined, an/ error is caused and the
remainder of the line is ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that *zsh*/ makes no distinction between modules that were linked /
into the shell and modules that are loaded dynamically. In both cases
this builtin command has to be used to make available the builtins and
other things defined by modules (unless the module is autoloaded on
these definitions). This is true even for systems that don&#39;t support
dynamic loading of modules.</p>
