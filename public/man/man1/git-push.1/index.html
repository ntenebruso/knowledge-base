DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary to
complete the given refs.</p>
<p>
You can make interesting things happen to a repository every time you
push into it, by setting up <em>hooks</em> there. See documentation for
*git-receive-pack*(1).</p>
<p>
When the command line does not specify where to push with the
<strong>&lt;repository&gt;</strong> argument, <strong>branch.</strong>.remote* configuration for the current
branch is consulted to determine where to push. If the configuration is
missing, it defaults to <em>origin</em>.</p>
<p>
When the command line does not specify what to push with <strong>&lt;refspec&gt;…</strong>
arguments or <strong>–all</strong>, <strong>–mirror</strong>, <strong>–tags</strong> options, the command finds
the default <strong>&lt;refspec&gt;</strong> by consulting <strong>remote.</strong>.push* configuration, and
if it is not found, honors <strong>push.default</strong> configuration to decide what
to push (See <strong>git-config*(1) for the meaning of *push.default</strong>).</p>
<p>
When neither the command-line nor the configuration specifies what to
push, the default behavior is used, which corresponds to the <strong>simple</strong>
value for <strong>push.default</strong>: the current branch is pushed to the
corresponding upstream branch, but as a safety measure, the push is
aborted if the upstream branch does not have the same name as the local
one.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>&lt;repository&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The &#34;remote&#34; repository that is the destination of a push operation.
This parameter can be either a URL (see the section GIT URLS below) or
the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES below).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;refspec&gt;…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify what destination ref to update with what source object. The
format of a &lt;refspec&gt; parameter is an optional plus <strong>+</strong>, followed by the
source object &lt;src&gt;, followed by a colon <strong>:</strong>, followed by the
destination ref &lt;dst&gt;.</p>
<p>
The &lt;src&gt; is often the name of the branch you would want to push, but it
can be any arbitrary &#34;SHA-1 expression&#34;, such as <strong>master~4</strong> or <strong>HEAD</strong>
(see *gitrevisions*(7)).</p>
<p>
The &lt;dst&gt; tells which ref on the remote side is updated with this push.
Arbitrary expressions cannot be used here, an actual ref must be named.
If <strong>git push [&lt;repository&gt;]</strong> without any <strong>&lt;refspec&gt;</strong> argument is set to
update some ref at the destination with <strong>&lt;src&gt;</strong> with
<strong>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.push</strong> configuration variable, <strong>:&lt;dst&gt;</strong> part can be
omitted—such a push will update a ref that <strong>&lt;src&gt;</strong> normally updates
without any <strong>&lt;refspec&gt;</strong> on the command line. Otherwise, missing <strong>:&lt;dst&gt;</strong>
means to update the same ref as the <strong>&lt;src&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>
If &lt;dst&gt; doesn&#39;t start with <strong>refs/</strong> (e.g. <strong>refs/heads/master</strong>) we will
try to infer where in <strong>refs/*</strong> on the destination &lt;repository&gt; it
belongs based on the type of &lt;src&gt; being pushed and whether &lt;dst&gt; is
ambiguous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
If &lt;dst&gt; unambiguously refers to a ref on the &lt;repository&gt; remote, then
push to that ref.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
If &lt;src&gt; resolves to a ref starting with refs/heads/ or refs/tags/, then
prepend that to &lt;dst&gt;.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Other ambiguity resolutions might be added in the future, but for now
any other cases will error out with an error indicating what we tried,
and depending on the <strong>advice.pushUnqualifiedRefname</strong> configuration (see
*git-config*(1)) suggest what refs/ namespace you may have wanted to
push to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The object referenced by &lt;src&gt; is used to update the &lt;dst&gt; reference on
the remote side. Whether this is allowed depends on where in <strong>refs/*</strong>
the &lt;dst&gt; reference lives as described in detail below, in those
sections &#34;update&#34; means any modifications except deletes, which as noted
after the next few sections are treated differently.</p>
<p>
The <strong>refs/heads/*</strong> namespace will only accept commit objects, and
updates only if they can be fast-forwarded.</p>
<p>
The <strong>refs/tags/*</strong> namespace will accept any kind of object (as commits,
trees and blobs can be tagged), and any updates to them will be
rejected.</p>
<p>
It&#39;s possible to push any type of object to any namespace outside of
<strong>refs/{tags,heads}/*</strong>. In the case of tags and commits, these will be
treated as if they were the commits inside <strong>refs/heads/*</strong> for the
purposes of whether the update is allowed.</p>
<p>
I.e. a fast-forward of commits and tags outside <strong>refs/{tags,heads}/*</strong> is
allowed, even in cases where what&#39;s being fast-forwarded is not a
commit, but a tag object which happens to point to a new commit which is
a fast-forward of the commit the last tag (or commit) it&#39;s replacing.
Replacing a tag with an entirely different tag is also allowed, if it
points to the same commit, as well as pushing a peeled tag, i.e. pushing
the commit that existing tag object points to, or a new tag object which
an existing commit points to.</p>
<p>
Tree and blob objects outside of <strong>refs/{tags,heads}/*</strong> will be treated
the same way as if they were inside <strong>refs/tags/*</strong>, any update of them
will be rejected.</p>
<p>
All of the rules described above about what&#39;s not allowed as an update
can be overridden by adding an the optional leading <strong>+</strong> to a refspec (or
using <strong>–force</strong> command line option). The only exception to this is that
no amount of forcing will make the <strong>refs/heads/*</strong> namespace accept a
non-commit object. Hooks and configuration can also override or amend
these rules, see e.g. <strong>receive.denyNonFastForwards</strong> in <strong>git-config*(1)
and *pre-receive</strong> and <strong>update</strong> in *githooks*(5).</p>
<p>
Pushing an empty &lt;src&gt; allows you to delete the &lt;dst&gt; ref from the
remote repository. Deletions are always accepted without a leading <strong>+</strong>
in the refspec (or <strong>–force</strong>), except when forbidden by configuration or
hooks. See <strong>receive.denyDeletes</strong> in <strong>git-config*(1) and *pre-receive</strong>
and <strong>update</strong> in *githooks*(5).</p>
<p>
The special refspec <strong>:</strong> (or <strong>+:</strong> to allow non-fast-forward updates)
directs Git to push &#34;matching&#34; branches: for every branch that exists on
the local side, the remote side is updated if a branch of the same name
already exists on the remote side.</p>
<p>
<strong>tag &lt;tag&gt;</strong> means the same as <strong>refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;:refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–all, –branches</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Push all branches (i.e. refs under <strong>refs/heads/</strong>); cannot be used with
other &lt;refspec&gt;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–prune</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remove remote branches that don&#39;t have a local counterpart. For example
a remote branch <strong>tmp</strong> will be removed if a local branch with the same
name doesn&#39;t exist any more. This also respects refspecs, e.g. <strong>git push
–prune remote refs/heads/</strong>:refs/tmp/** would make sure that remote
<strong>refs/tmp/foo</strong> will be removed if <strong>refs/heads/foo</strong> doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–mirror</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies that all refs under
<strong>refs/</strong> (which includes but is not limited to <strong>refs/heads/</strong>,
<strong>refs/remotes/</strong>, and <strong>refs/tags/</strong>) be mirrored to the remote repository.
Newly created local refs will be pushed to the remote end, locally
updated refs will be force updated on the remote end, and deleted refs
will be removed from the remote end. This is the default if the
configuration option <strong>remote.&lt;remote&gt;.mirror</strong> is set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-n, –dry-run</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do everything except actually send the updates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–porcelain</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Produce machine-readable output. The output status line for each ref
will be tab-separated and sent to stdout instead of stderr. The full
symbolic names of the refs will be given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-d, –delete</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All listed refs are deleted from the remote repository. This is the same
as prefixing all refs with a colon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–tags</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All refs under <strong>refs/tags</strong> are pushed, in addition to refspecs
explicitly listed on the command line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–follow-tags</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Push all the refs that would be pushed without this option, and also
push annotated tags in <strong>refs/tags</strong> that are missing from the remote but
are pointing at commit-ish that are reachable from the refs being
pushed. This can also be specified with configuration variable
<strong>push.followTags</strong>. For more information, see <strong>push.followTags</strong> in
*git-config*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]signed, –signed=(true|false|if-asked)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GPG-sign the push request to update refs on the receiving side, to allow
it to be checked by the hooks and/or be logged. If <strong>false</strong> or
<strong>–no-signed</strong>, no signing will be attempted. If <strong>true</strong> or <strong>–signed</strong>,
the push will fail if the server does not support signed pushes. If set
to <strong>if-asked</strong>, sign if and only if the server supports signed pushes.
The push will also fail if the actual call to <strong>gpg –sign</strong> fails. See
*git-receive-pack*(1) for the details on the receiving end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]atomic</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use an atomic transaction on the remote side if available. Either all
refs are updated, or on error, no refs are updated. If the server does
not support atomic pushes the push will fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-o &lt;option&gt;, –push-option=&lt;option&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Transmit the given string to the server, which passes them to the
pre-receive as well as the post-receive hook. The given string must not
contain a NUL or LF character. When multiple <strong>–push-option=&lt;option&gt;</strong>
are given, they are all sent to the other side in the order listed on
the command line. When no <strong>–push-option=&lt;option&gt;</strong> is given from the
command line, the values of configuration variable <strong>push.pushOption</strong> are
used instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–receive-pack=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;, –exec=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Path to the <em>git-receive-pack</em> program on the remote end. Sometimes
useful when pushing to a remote repository over ssh, and you do not have
the program in a directory on the default $PATH.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]force-with-lease, –force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;,
–force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Usually, &#34;git push&#34; refuses to update a remote ref that is not an
ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it.</p>
<p>
This option overrides this restriction if the current value of the
remote ref is the expected value. &#34;git push&#34; fails otherwise.</p>
<p>
Imagine that you have to rebase what you have already published. You
will have to bypass the &#34;must fast-forward&#34; rule in order to replace the
history you originally published with the rebased history. If somebody
else built on top of your original history while you are rebasing, the
tip of the branch at the remote may advance with their commit, and
blindly pushing with <strong>–force</strong> will lose their work.</p>
<p>
This option allows you to say that you expect the history you are
updating is what you rebased and want to replace. If the remote ref
still points at the commit you specified, you can be sure that no other
people did anything to the ref. It is like taking a &#34;lease&#34; on the ref
without explicitly locking it, and the remote ref is updated only if the
&#34;lease&#34; is still valid.</p>
<p>
<strong>–force-with-lease</strong> alone, without specifying the details, will protect
all remote refs that are going to be updated by requiring their current
value to be the same as the remote-tracking branch we have for them.</p>
<p>
<strong>–force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;</strong>, without specifying the expected value,
will protect the named ref (alone), if it is going to be updated, by
requiring its current value to be the same as the remote-tracking branch
we have for it.</p>
<p>
<strong>–force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</strong> will protect the named ref
(alone), if it is going to be updated, by requiring its current value to
be the same as the specified value <strong>&lt;expect&gt;</strong> (which is allowed to be
different from the remote-tracking branch we have for the refname, or we
do not even have to have such a remote-tracking branch when this form is
used). If <strong>&lt;expect&gt;</strong> is the empty string, then the named ref must not
already exist.</p>
<p>
Note that all forms other than <strong>–force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</strong>
that specifies the expected current value of the ref explicitly are
still experimental and their semantics may change as we gain experience
with this feature.</p>
<p>
&#34;–no-force-with-lease&#34; will cancel all the previous –force-with-lease
on the command line.</p>
<p>
A general note on safety: supplying this option without an expected
value, i.e. as <strong>–force-with-lease</strong> or <strong>–force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;</strong>
interacts very badly with anything that implicitly runs <strong>git fetch</strong> on
the remote to be pushed to in the background, e.g. <strong>git fetch origin</strong> on
your repository in a cronjob.</p>
<p>
The protection it offers over <strong>–force</strong> is ensuring that subsequent
changes your work wasn&#39;t based on aren&#39;t clobbered, but this is
trivially defeated if some background process is updating refs in the
background. We don&#39;t have anything except the remote tracking info to go
by as a heuristic for refs you&#39;re expected to have seen &amp; are willing to
clobber.</p>
<p>
If your editor or some other system is running <strong>git fetch</strong> in the
background for you a way to mitigate this is to simply set up another
remote:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git remote add origin-push $(git config remote.origin.url)
git fetch origin-push
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now when the background process runs <strong>git fetch origin</strong> the references
on <strong>origin-push</strong> won&#39;t be updated, and thus commands like:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git push --force-with-lease origin-push
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Will fail unless you manually run <strong>git fetch origin-push</strong>. This method
is of course entirely defeated by something that runs <strong>git fetch –all</strong>,
in that case you&#39;d need to either disable it or do something more
tedious like:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git fetch              # update master from remote
git tag base master    # mark our base point
git rebase -i master   # rewrite some commits
git push --force-with-lease=master:base master:master
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
I.e. create a <strong>base</strong> tag for versions of the upstream code that you&#39;ve
seen and are willing to overwrite, then rewrite history, and finally
force push changes to <strong>master</strong> if the remote version is still at <strong>base</strong>,
regardless of what your local <strong>remotes/origin/master</strong> has been updated
to in the background.</p>
<p>
Alternatively, specifying <strong>–force-if-includes</strong> as an ancillary option
along with <strong>–force-with-lease[=&lt;refname&gt;]</strong> (i.e., without saying what
exact commit the ref on the remote side must be pointing at, or which
refs on the remote side are being protected) at the time of &#34;push&#34; will
verify if updates from the remote-tracking refs that may have been
implicitly updated in the background are integrated locally before
allowing a forced update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-f, –force</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that is not an
ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it. Also, when
<strong>–force-with-lease</strong> option is used, the command refuses to update a
remote ref whose current value does not match what is expected.</p>
<p>
This flag disables these checks, and can cause the remote repository to
lose commits; use it with care.</p>
<p>
Note that <strong>–force</strong> applies to all the refs that are pushed, hence using
it with <strong>push.default</strong> set to <strong>matching</strong> or with multiple push
destinations configured with <strong>remote.</strong>.push* may overwrite refs other
than the current branch (including local refs that are strictly behind
their remote counterpart). To force a push to only one branch, use a <strong>+</strong>
in front of the refspec to push (e.g <strong>git push origin +master</strong> to force
a push to the <strong>master</strong> branch). See the <strong>&lt;refspec&gt;…</strong> section above for
details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]force-if-includes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Force an update only if the tip of the remote-tracking ref has been
integrated locally.</p>
<p>
This option enables a check that verifies if the tip of the
remote-tracking ref is reachable from one of the &#34;reflog&#34; entries of the
local branch based in it for a rewrite. The check ensures that any
updates from the remote have been incorporated locally by rejecting the
forced update if that is not the case.</p>
<p>
If the option is passed without specifying <strong>–force-with-lease</strong>, or
specified along with <strong>–force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</strong>, it is a
&#34;no-op&#34;.</p>
<p>
Specifying <strong>–no-force-if-includes</strong> disables this behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–repo=&lt;repository&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is equivalent to the &lt;repository&gt; argument. If both are
specified, the command-line argument takes precedence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-u, –set-upstream</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For every branch that is up to date or successfully pushed, add upstream
(tracking) reference, used by argument-less <strong>git-pull*(1) and other
commands. For more information, see *branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</strong> in
*git-config*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]thin</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These options are passed to *git-send-pack*(1). A thin transfer
significantly reduces the amount of sent data when the sender and
receiver share many of the same objects in common. The default is
<strong>–thin</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-q, –quiet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppress all output, including the listing of updated refs, unless an
error occurs. Progress is not reported to the standard error stream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-v, –verbose</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run verbosely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–progress</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default when
it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is specified. This flag forces
progress status even if the standard error stream is not directed to a
terminal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-recurse-submodules, –recurse-submodules=check|on-demand|only|no</p>
<blockquote>
<p>May be used to make sure all submodule commits used by the revisions to
be pushed are available on a remote-tracking branch. If <em>check</em> is used
Git will verify that all submodule commits that changed in the revisions
to be pushed are available on at least one remote of the submodule. If
any commits are missing the push will be aborted and exit with non-zero
status. If <em>on-demand</em> is used all submodules that changed in the
revisions to be pushed will be pushed. If on-demand was not able to push
all necessary revisions it will also be aborted and exit with non-zero
status. If <em>only</em> is used all submodules will be pushed while the
superproject is left unpushed. A value of <em>no</em> or using
<strong>–no-recurse-submodules</strong> can be used to override the
push.recurseSubmodules configuration variable when no submodule
recursion is required.</p>
<p>
When using <em>on-demand</em> or <em>only</em>, if a submodule has a
&#34;push.recurseSubmodules={on-demand,only}&#34; or &#34;submodule.recurse&#34;
configuration, further recursion will occur. In this case, &#34;only&#34; is
treated as &#34;on-demand&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]verify</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Toggle the pre-push hook (see *githooks*(5)). The default is –verify,
giving the hook a chance to prevent the push. With –no-verify, the hook
is bypassed completely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Use IPv4 addresses only, ignoring IPv6 addresses.</p>

GIT URLS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the
address of the remote server, and the path to the repository. Depending
on the transport protocol, some of this information may be absent.</p>
<p>
Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp and
ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and deprecated;
do not use them).</p>
<p>
The native transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and should
be used with caution on unsecured networks.</p>
<p>
The following syntaxes may be used with them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>ssh://</strong>[/&lt;user&gt;/*@*]/&lt;host&gt;/[*:*/&lt;port&gt;/]*/*/&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;/</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
*git://*/&lt;host&gt;/[:/&lt;port&gt;/]*/*/&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;/</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>http</strong>[*s*]*://*/&lt;host&gt;/[*:*/&lt;port&gt;/]*/*/&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;/</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>ftp</strong>[*s*]*://*/&lt;host&gt;/[*:*/&lt;port&gt;/]*/*/&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
[/&lt;user&gt;/*@*]/&lt;host&gt;/*:/*/&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the first
colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a colon. For
example the local path <strong>foo:bar</strong> could be specified as an absolute path
or <strong>./foo:bar</strong> to avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh url.</p>
<p>
The ssh and git protocols additionally support *~*/&lt;username&gt;/
expansion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>ssh://</strong>[/&lt;user&gt;/*@*]/&lt;host&gt;/[*:*/&lt;port&gt;/]*/~*/&lt;user&gt;/*/*/&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;/</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>git://*/&lt;host&gt;/[</strong>:*/&lt;port&gt;/]*/~*/&lt;user&gt;/*/*/&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;/</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the following
syntaxes may be used:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong><em>path/to/repo.git</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="///path/to/repo.git/">///path/to/repo.git/</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning, when the
former implies <strong>–local</strong> option. See *git-clone*(1) for details.</p>
<p>
<strong>git clone</strong>, <strong>git fetch</strong> and <strong>git pull</strong>, but not <strong>git push</strong>, will also
accept a suitable bundle file. See *git-bundle*(1).</p>
<p>
When Git doesn&#39;t know how to handle a certain transport protocol, it
attempts to use the *remote-*/&lt;transport&gt;/ remote helper, if one exists.
To explicitly request a remote helper, the following syntax may be used:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>&lt;transport&gt;</em>::/&lt;address&gt;/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
where <em>&lt;address&gt;</em> may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary
URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being invoked.
See *gitremote-helpers*(7) for details.</p>
<p>
If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories and
you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you use
will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a configuration
section of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        [url &#34;&lt;actual-url-base&gt;&#34;]
                insteadOf = &lt;other-url-base&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
For example, with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        [url &#34;git://git.host.xz/&#34;]
                insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
                insteadOf = work:
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
a URL like &#34;work:repo.git&#34; or like &#34;host.xz:/path/to/repo.git&#34; will be
rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be
&#34;git://git.host.xz/repo.git&#34;.</p>
<p>
If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a
configuration section of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        [url &#34;&lt;actual-url-base&gt;&#34;]
                pushInsteadOf = &lt;other-url-base&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
For example, with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        [url &#34;ssh://example.org/&#34;]
                pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
a URL like &#34;git://example.org/path/to/repo.git&#34; will be rewritten to
&#34;ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git&#34; for pushes, but pulls will still
use the original URL.</p>

NOTE ABOUT FAST-FORWARDS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When an update changes a branch (or more in general, a ref) that used to
point at commit A to point at another commit B, it is called a
fast-forward update if and only if B is a descendant of A.</p>
<p>
In a fast-forward update from A to B, the set of commits that the
original commit A built on top of is a subset of the commits the new
commit B builds on top of. Hence, it does not lose any history.</p>
<p>
In contrast, a non-fast-forward update will lose history. For example,
suppose you and somebody else started at the same commit X, and you
built a history leading to commit B while the other person built a
history leading to commit A. The history looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
      B
     /
 ---X---A
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Further suppose that the other person already pushed changes leading to
A back to the original repository from which you two obtained the
original commit X.</p>
<p>
The push done by the other person updated the branch that used to point
at commit X to point at commit A. It is a fast-forward.</p>
<p>
But if you try to push, you will attempt to update the branch (that now
points at A) with commit B. This does <em>not</em> fast-forward. If you did so,
the changes introduced by commit A will be lost, because everybody will
now start building on top of B.</p>
<p>
The command by default does not allow an update that is not a
fast-forward to prevent such loss of history.</p>
<p>
If you do not want to lose your work (history from X to B) or the work
by the other person (history from X to A), you would need to first fetch
the history from the repository, create a history that contains changes
done by both parties, and push the result back.</p>
<p>
You can perform &#34;git pull&#34;, resolve potential conflicts, and &#34;git push&#34;
the result. A &#34;git pull&#34; will create a merge commit C between commits A
and B.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
      B---C
     /   /
 ---X---A
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Updating A with the resulting merge commit will fast-forward and your
push will be accepted.</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you can rebase your change between X and B on top of A,
with &#34;git pull –rebase&#34;, and push the result back. The rebase will
create a new commit D that builds the change between X and B on top of</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
      B   D
     /   /
 ---X---A
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, updating A with this commit will fast-forward and your push will
be accepted.</p>
<p>
There is another common situation where you may encounter
non-fast-forward rejection when you try to push, and it is possible even
when you are pushing into a repository nobody else pushes into. After
you push commit A yourself (in the first picture in this section),
replace it with &#34;git commit –amend&#34; to produce commit B, and you try to
push it out, because forgot that you have pushed A out already. In such
a case, and only if you are certain that nobody in the meantime fetched
your earlier commit A (and started building on top of it), you can run
&#34;git push –force&#34; to overwrite it. In other words, &#34;git push –force&#34;
is a method reserved for a case where you do mean to lose history.</p>

EXAMPLES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>git push</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Works like <strong>git push &lt;remote&gt;</strong>, where &lt;remote&gt; is the current branch&#39;s
remote (or <strong>origin</strong>, if no remote is configured for the current branch).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>git push origin</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without additional configuration, pushes the current branch to the
configured upstream (<strong>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</strong> configuration variable) if it
has the same name as the current branch, and errors out without pushing
otherwise.</p>
<p>
The default behavior of this command when no &lt;refspec&gt; is given can be
configured by setting the <strong>push</strong> option of the remote, or the
<strong>push.default</strong> configuration variable.</p>
<p>
For example, to default to pushing only the current branch to <strong>origin</strong>
use <strong>git config remote.origin.push HEAD</strong>. Any valid &lt;refspec&gt; (like the
ones in the examples below) can be configured as the default for <strong>git
push origin</strong>.</p>

<p>
<strong>git push origin :</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>git push origin master</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find a ref that matches <strong>master</strong> in the source repository (most likely,
it would find <strong>refs/heads/master</strong>), and update the same ref (e.g.
<strong>refs/heads/master</strong>) in <strong>origin</strong> repository with it. If <strong>master</strong> did not
exist remotely, it would be created.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>git push origin HEAD</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A handy way to push the current branch to the same name on the remote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>git push mothership master:satellite/master dev:satellite/dev</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the source ref that matches <strong>master</strong> (e.g. <strong>refs/heads/master</strong>) to
update the ref that matches <strong>satellite/master</strong> (most probably
<strong>refs/remotes/satellite/master</strong>) in the <strong>mothership</strong> repository; do the
same for <strong>dev</strong> and <strong>satellite/dev</strong>.</p>
<p>
See the section describing <strong>&lt;refspec&gt;…</strong> above for a discussion of the
matching semantics.</p>
<p>
This is to emulate <strong>git fetch</strong> run on the <strong>mothership</strong> using <strong>git push</strong>
that is run in the opposite direction in order to integrate the work
done on <strong>satellite</strong>, and is often necessary when you can only make
connection in one way (i.e. satellite can ssh into mothership but
mothership cannot initiate connection to satellite because the latter is
behind a firewall or does not run sshd).</p>
<p>
After running this <strong>git push</strong> on the <strong>satellite</strong> machine, you would ssh
into the <strong>mothership</strong> and run <strong>git merge</strong> there to complete the
emulation of <strong>git pull</strong> that were run on <strong>mothership</strong> to pull changes
made on <strong>satellite</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>git push origin HEAD:master</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Push the current branch to the remote ref matching <strong>master</strong> in the
<strong>origin</strong> repository. This form is convenient to push the current branch
without thinking about its local name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>git push origin master:refs/heads/experimental</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create the branch <strong>experimental</strong> in the <strong>origin</strong> repository by copying
the current <strong>master</strong> branch. This form is only needed to create a new
branch or tag in the remote repository when the local name and the
remote name are different; otherwise, the ref name on its own will work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>git push origin :experimental</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find a ref that matches <strong>experimental</strong> in the <strong>origin</strong> repository (e.g.
<strong>refs/heads/experimental</strong>), and delete it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>git push origin +dev:master</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update the origin repository&#39;s master branch with the dev branch,
allowing non-fast-forward updates. <strong>This can leave unreferenced commits
dangling in the origin repository.</strong> Consider the following situation,
where a fast-forward is not possible:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
            o---o---o---A---B  origin/master
                     \

SECURITY
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side from
stealing data from the other repository that was not intended to be
shared. If you have private data that you need to protect from a
malicious peer, your best option is to store it in another repository.
This applies to both clients and servers. In particular, namespaces on a
server are not effective for read access control; you should only grant
read access to a namespace to clients that you would trust with read
access to the entire repository.</p>
<p>
The known attack vectors are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The victim sends &#34;have&#34; lines advertising the IDs of objects it has that
are not explicitly intended to be shared but can be used to optimize the
transfer if the peer also has them. The attacker chooses an object ID X
to steal and sends a ref to X, but isn&#39;t required to send the content of
X because the victim already has it. Now the victim believes that the
attacker has X, and it sends the content of X back to the attacker
later. (This attack is most straightforward for a client to perform on a
server, by creating a ref to X in the namespace the client has access to
and then fetching it. The most likely way for a server to perform it on
a client is to &#34;merge&#34; X into a public branch and hope that the user
does additional work on this branch and pushes it back to the server
without noticing the merge.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>As in #1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to steal. The victim sends
an object Y that the attacker already has, and the attacker falsely
claims to have X and not Y, so the victim sends Y as a delta against X.
The delta reveals regions of X that are similar to Y to the attacker.</p>

is useful if by default you want new branches to be pushed to the
default remote (like the behavior of <em>push.default=current</em>) and you
also want the upstream tracking to be set. Workflows most likely to
benefit from this option are <em>simple</em> central workflows where all
branches are expected to have the same name on the remote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
push.default</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defines the action <strong>git push</strong> should take if no refspec is given
(whether from the command-line, config, or elsewhere). Different values
are well-suited for specific workflows; for instance, in a purely
central workflow (i.e. the fetch source is equal to the push
destination), <strong>upstream</strong> is probably what you want. Possible values are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>nothing</strong> - do not push anything (error out) unless a refspec is given.
This is primarily meant for people who want to avoid mistakes by always
being explicit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>current</strong> - push the current branch to update a branch with the same
name on the receiving end. Works in both central and non-central
workflows.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>upstream</strong> - push the current branch back to the branch whose changes
are usually integrated into the current branch (which is called
<strong>@{upstream}</strong>). This mode only makes sense if you are pushing to the
same repository you would normally pull from (i.e. central workflow).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>tracking</strong> - This is a deprecated synonym for <strong>upstream</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>simple</strong> - push the current branch with the same name on the remote.</p>
<p>
If you are working on a centralized workflow (pushing to the same
repository you pull from, which is typically <strong>origin</strong>), then you need to
configure an upstream branch with the same name.</p>
<p>
This mode is the default since Git 2.0, and is the safest option suited
for beginners.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>matching</strong> - push all branches having the same name on both ends. This
makes the repository you are pushing to remember the set of branches
that will be pushed out (e.g. if you always push <em>maint</em> and <em>master</em>
there and no other branches, the repository you push to will have these
two branches, and your local <em>maint</em> and <em>master</em> will be pushed there).</p>
<p>
To use this mode effectively, you have to make sure <em>all</em> the branches
you would push out are ready to be pushed out before running <em>git push</em>,
as the whole point of this mode is to allow you to push all of the
branches in one go. If you usually finish work on only one branch and
push out the result, while other branches are unfinished, this mode is
not for you. Also this mode is not suitable for pushing into a shared
central repository, as other people may add new branches there, or
update the tip of existing branches outside your control.</p>
<p>
This used to be the default, but not since Git 2.0 (<strong>simple</strong> is the new
default).</p>

push.followTags</p>

<strong>–no-follow-tags</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
push.gpgSign</p>
<blockquote>
<p>May be set to a boolean value, or the string <em>if-asked</em>. A true value
causes all pushes to be GPG signed, as if <strong>–signed</strong> is passed to
<strong>git-push*(1). The string <em>if-asked</em> causes pushes to be signed if the
server supports it, as if *–signed=if-asked</strong> is passed to <em>git push</em>. A
false value may override a value from a lower-priority config file. An
explicit command-line flag always overrides this config option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
push.pushOption</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When no <strong>–push-option=&lt;option&gt;</strong> argument is given from the command
line, <strong>git push</strong> behaves as if each &lt;value&gt; of this variable is given as
<strong>–push-option=&lt;value&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>
This is a multi-valued variable, and an empty value can be used in a
higher priority configuration file (e.g. <strong>.git/config</strong> in a repository)
to clear the values inherited from a lower priority configuration files
(e.g. <strong>$HOME/.gitconfig</strong>).</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
Example:

/etc/gitconfig
  push.pushoption = a
  push.pushoption = b

~/.gitconfig
  push.pushoption = c

repo/.git/config
  push.pushoption =
  push.pushoption = b

This will result in only b (a and c are cleared).
</pre>

<p>
push.recurseSubmodules</p>
<blockquote>
<p>May be &#34;check&#34;, &#34;on-demand&#34;, &#34;only&#34;, or &#34;no&#34;, with the same behavior as
that of &#34;push –recurse-submodules&#34;. If not set, <em>no</em> is used by
default, unless <em>submodule.recurse</em> is set (in which case a <em>true</em> value
means <em>on-demand</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
push.useForceIfIncludes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to &#34;true&#34;, it is equivalent to specifying <strong>–force-if-includes</strong>
as an option to <strong>git-push*(1) in the command line. Adding
*–no-force-if-includes</strong> at the time of push overrides this
configuration setting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
push.negotiate</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to &#34;true&#34;, attempt to reduce the size of the packfile sent by
rounds of negotiation in which the client and the server attempt to find
commits in common. If &#34;false&#34;, Git will rely solely on the server&#39;s ref
advertisement to find commits in common.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
push.useBitmaps</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to &#34;false&#34;, disable use of bitmaps for &#34;git push&#34; even if
<strong>pack.useBitmaps</strong> is &#34;true&#34;, without preventing other git operations
from using bitmaps. Default is true.</p>
