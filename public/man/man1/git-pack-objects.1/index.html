DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Reads list of objects from the standard input, and writes either one or
more packed archives with the specified base-name to disk, or a packed
archive to the standard output.</p>
<p>
A packed archive is an efficient way to transfer a set of objects
between two repositories as well as an access efficient archival format.
In a packed archive, an object is either stored as a compressed whole or
as a difference from some other object. The latter is often called a
delta.</p>
<p>
The packed archive format (.pack) is designed to be self-contained so
that it can be unpacked without any further information. Therefore, each
object that a delta depends upon must be present within the pack.</p>
<p>
A pack index file (.idx) is generated for fast, random access to the
objects in the pack. Placing both the index file (.idx) and the packed
archive (.pack) in the pack/ subdirectory of $GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY (or
any of the directories on $GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES) enables Git
to read from the pack archive.</p>
<p>
The <em>git unpack-objects</em> command can read the packed archive and expand
the objects contained in the pack into &#34;one-file one-object&#34; format;
this is typically done by the smart-pull commands when a pack is created
on-the-fly for efficient network transport by their peers.</p>

<h2 id="headline-4">
OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>base-name</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write into pairs of files (.pack and .idx), using &lt;base-name&gt; to
determine the name of the created file. When this option is used, the
two files in a pair are written in &lt;base-name&gt;-&lt;SHA-1&gt;.{pack,idx} files.
&lt;SHA-1&gt; is a hash based on the pack content and is written to the
standard output of the command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–stdout</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write the pack contents (what would have been written to .pack file) out
to the standard output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–revs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read the revision arguments from the standard input, instead of
individual object names. The revision arguments are processed the same
way as <em>git rev-list</em> with the <strong>–objects</strong> flag uses its <strong>commit</strong>
arguments to build the list of objects it outputs. The objects on the
resulting list are packed. Besides revisions, <strong>–not</strong> or <strong>–shallow
&lt;SHA-1&gt;</strong> lines are also accepted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–unpacked</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This implies <strong>–revs</strong>. When processing the list of revision arguments
read from the standard input, limit the objects packed to those that are
not already packed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–all</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This implies <strong>–revs</strong>. In addition to the list of revision arguments
read from the standard input, pretend as if all refs under <strong>refs/</strong> are
specified to be included.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–include-tag</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Include unasked-for annotated tags if the object they reference was
included in the resulting packfile. This can be useful to send new tags
to native Git clients.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–stdin-packs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read the basenames of packfiles (e.g., <strong>pack-1234abcd.pack</strong>) from the
standard input, instead of object names or revision arguments. The
resulting pack contains all objects listed in the included packs (those
not beginning with <strong>^</strong>), excluding any objects listed in the excluded
packs (beginning with <strong>^</strong>).</p>
<p>
Incompatible with <strong>–revs</strong>, or options that imply <strong>–revs</strong> (such as
<strong>–all</strong>), with the exception of <strong>–unpacked</strong>, which is compatible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–cruft</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Packs unreachable objects into a separate &#34;cruft&#34; pack, denoted by the
existence of a <strong>.mtimes</strong> file. Typically used by <strong>git repack –cruft</strong>.
Callers provide a list of pack names and indicate which packs will
remain in the repository, along with which packs will be deleted
(indicated by the <strong>-</strong> prefix). The contents of the cruft pack are all
objects not contained in the surviving packs which have not exceeded the
grace period (see <strong>–cruft-expiration</strong> below), or which have exceeded
the grace period, but are reachable from an other object which hasn&#39;t.</p>
<p>
When the input lists a pack containing all reachable objects (and lists
all other packs as pending deletion), the corresponding cruft pack will
contain all unreachable objects (with mtime newer than the
<strong>–cruft-expiration</strong>) along with any unreachable objects whose mtime is
older than the <strong>–cruft-expiration</strong>, but are reachable from an
unreachable object whose mtime is newer than the <strong>–cruft-expiration</strong>).</p>
<p>
Incompatible with <strong>–unpack-unreachable</strong>, <strong>–keep-unreachable</strong>,
<strong>–pack-loose-unreachable</strong>, <strong>–stdin-packs</strong>, as well as any other
options which imply <strong>–revs</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–cruft-expiration=&lt;approxidate&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If specified, objects are eliminated from the cruft pack if they have an
mtime older than <strong>&lt;approxidate&gt;</strong>. If unspecified (and given <strong>–cruft</strong>),
then no objects are eliminated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–window=&lt;n&gt;, –depth=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These two options affect how the objects contained in the pack are
stored using delta compression. The objects are first internally sorted
by type, size and optionally names and compared against the other
objects within –window to see if using delta compression saves space.
–depth limits the maximum delta depth; making it too deep affects the
performance on the unpacker side, because delta data needs to be applied
that many times to get to the necessary object.</p>
<p>
The default value for –window is 10 and –depth is 50. The maximum
depth is 4095.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–window-memory=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option provides an additional limit on top of <strong>–window</strong>; the
window size will dynamically scale down so as to not take up more than
<em>&lt;n&gt;</em> bytes in memory. This is useful in repositories with a mix of
large and small objects to not run out of memory with a large window,
but still be able to take advantage of the large window for the smaller
objects. The size can be suffixed with &#34;k&#34;, &#34;m&#34;, or &#34;g&#34;.
<strong>–window-memory=0</strong> makes memory usage unlimited. The default is taken
from the <strong>pack.windowMemory</strong> configuration variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–max-pack-size=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In unusual scenarios, you may not be able to create files larger than a
certain size on your filesystem, and this option can be used to tell the
command to split the output packfile into multiple independent
packfiles, each not larger than the given size. The size can be suffixed
with &#34;k&#34;, &#34;m&#34;, or &#34;g&#34;. The minimum size allowed is limited to 1 MiB. The
default is unlimited, unless the config variable <strong>pack.packSizeLimit</strong> is
set. Note that this option may result in a larger and slower repository;
see the discussion in <strong>pack.packSizeLimit</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–honor-pack-keep</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This flag causes an object already in a local pack that has a .keep file
to be ignored, even if it would have otherwise been packed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–keep-pack=&lt;pack-name&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This flag causes an object already in the given pack to be ignored, even
if it would have otherwise been packed. <strong>&lt;pack-name&gt;</strong> is the pack file
name without leading directory (e.g. <strong>pack-123.pack</strong>). The option could
be specified multiple times to keep multiple packs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–incremental</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This flag causes an object already in a pack to be ignored even if it
would have otherwise been packed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–local</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This flag causes an object that is borrowed from an alternate object
store to be ignored even if it would have otherwise been packed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–non-empty</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only create a packed archive if it would contain at least one object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–progress</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default when
it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is specified. This flag forces
progress status even if the standard error stream is not directed to a
terminal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–all-progress</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When –stdout is specified then progress report is displayed during the
object count and compression phases but inhibited during the write-out
phase. The reason is that in some cases the output stream is directly
linked to another command which may wish to display progress status of
its own as it processes incoming pack data. This flag is like –progress
except that it forces progress report for the write-out phase as well
even if –stdout is used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–all-progress-implied</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is used to imply –all-progress whenever progress display is
activated. Unlike –all-progress this flag doesn&#39;t actually force any
progress display by itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-q</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This flag makes the command not to report its progress on the standard
error stream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-reuse-delta</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When creating a packed archive in a repository that has existing packs,
the command reuses existing deltas. This sometimes results in a slightly
suboptimal pack. This flag tells the command not to reuse existing
deltas but compute them from scratch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-reuse-object</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This flag tells the command not to reuse existing object data at all,
including non deltified object, forcing recompression of everything.
This implies –no-reuse-delta. Useful only in the obscure case where
wholesale enforcement of a different compression level on the packed
data is desired.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–compression=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies compression level for newly-compressed data in the generated
pack. If not specified, pack compression level is determined first by
pack.compression, then by core.compression, and defaults to -1, the zlib
default, if neither is set. Add –no-reuse-object if you want to force a
uniform compression level on all data no matter the source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]sparse</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Toggle the &#34;sparse&#34; algorithm to determine which objects to include in
the pack, when combined with the &#34;–revs&#34; option. This algorithm only
walks trees that appear in paths that introduce new objects. This can
have significant performance benefits when computing a pack to send a
small change. However, it is possible that extra objects are added to
the pack-file if the included commits contain certain types of direct
renames. If this option is not included, it defaults to the value of
<strong>pack.useSparse</strong>, which is true unless otherwise specified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–thin</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a &#34;thin&#34; pack by omitting the common objects between a sender and
a receiver in order to reduce network transfer. This option only makes
sense in conjunction with –stdout.</p>
<p>
Note: A thin pack violates the packed archive format by omitting
required objects and is thus unusable by Git without making it
self-contained. Use <strong>git index-pack –fix-thin</strong> (see
*git-index-pack*(1)) to restore the self-contained property.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–shallow</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Optimize a pack that will be provided to a client with a shallow
repository. This option, combined with –thin, can result in a smaller
pack at the cost of speed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–delta-base-offset</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A packed archive can express the base object of a delta as either a
20-byte object name or as an offset in the stream, but ancient versions
of Git don&#39;t understand the latter. By default, <em>git pack-objects</em> only
uses the former format for better compatibility. This option allows the
command to use the latter format for compactness. Depending on the
average delta chain length, this option typically shrinks the resulting
packfile by 3-5 per-cent.</p>
<p>
Note: Porcelain commands such as <strong>git gc</strong> (see <strong>git-gc*(1)), *git
repack</strong> (see *git-repack*(1)) pass this option by default in modern Git
when they put objects in your repository into pack files. So does <strong>git
bundle</strong> (see *git-bundle*(1)) when it creates a bundle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–threads=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the number of threads to spawn when searching for best delta
matches. This requires that pack-objects be compiled with pthreads
otherwise this option is ignored with a warning. This is meant to reduce
packing time on multiprocessor machines. The required amount of memory
for the delta search window is however multiplied by the number of
threads. Specifying 0 will cause Git to auto-detect the number of CPU&#39;s
and set the number of threads accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–index-version=&lt;version&gt;[,&lt;offset&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is intended to be used by the test suite only. It allows to force
the version for the generated pack index, and to force 64-bit index
entries on objects located above the given offset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–keep-true-parents</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With this option, parents that are hidden by grafts are packed
nevertheless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–filter=&lt;filter-spec&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Omits certain objects (usually blobs) from the resulting packfile. See
<strong>git-rev-list*(1) for valid *&lt;filter-spec&gt;</strong> forms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-filter</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turns off any previous <strong>–filter=</strong> argument.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–missing=&lt;missing-action&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A debug option to help with future &#34;partial clone&#34; development. This
option specifies how missing objects are handled.</p>
<p>
The form <em>–missing=error</em> requests that pack-objects stop with an error
if a missing object is encountered. If the repository is a partial
clone, an attempt to fetch missing objects will be made before declaring
them missing. This is the default action.</p>
<p>
The form <em>–missing=allow-any</em> will allow object traversal to continue
if a missing object is encountered. No fetch of a missing object will
occur. Missing objects will silently be omitted from the results.</p>
<p>
The form <em>–missing=allow-promisor</em> is like <em>allow-any</em>, but will only
allow object traversal to continue for EXPECTED promisor missing
objects. No fetch of a missing object will occur. An unexpected missing
object will raise an error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–exclude-promisor-objects</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Omit objects that are known to be in the promisor remote. (This option
has the purpose of operating only on locally created objects, so that
when we repack, we still maintain a distinction between locally created
objects [without .promisor] and objects from the promisor remote [with
.promisor].) This is used with partial clone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–keep-unreachable</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Objects unreachable from the refs in packs named with –unpacked= option
are added to the resulting pack, in addition to the reachable objects
that are not in packs marked with <strong>.keep files. This implies *–revs</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–pack-loose-unreachable</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pack unreachable loose objects (and their loose counterparts removed).
This implies <strong>–revs</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–unpack-unreachable</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep unreachable objects in loose form. This implies <strong>–revs</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–delta-islands</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Restrict delta matches based on &#34;islands&#34;. See DELTA ISLANDS below.</p>
</blockquote>

DELTA ISLANDS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When possible, <strong>pack-objects</strong> tries to reuse existing on-disk deltas to
avoid having to search for new ones on the fly. This is an important
optimization for serving fetches, because it means the server can avoid
inflating most objects at all and just send the bytes directly from
disk. This optimization can&#39;t work when an object is stored as a delta
against a base which the receiver does not have (and which we are not
already sending). In that case the server &#34;breaks&#34; the delta and has to
find a new one, which has a high CPU cost. Therefore it&#39;s important for
performance that the set of objects in on-disk delta relationships match
what a client would fetch.</p>
<p>
In a normal repository, this tends to work automatically. The objects
are mostly reachable from the branches and tags, and that&#39;s what clients
fetch. Any deltas we find on the server are likely to be between objects
the client has or will have.</p>
<p>
But in some repository setups, you may have several related but separate
groups of ref tips, with clients tending to fetch those groups
independently. For example, imagine that you are hosting several &#34;forks&#34;
of a repository in a single shared object store, and letting clients
view them as separate repositories through <strong>GIT_NAMESPACE</strong> or separate
repos using the alternates mechanism. A naive repack may find that the
optimal delta for an object is against a base that is only found in
another fork. But when a client fetches, they will not have the base
object, and we&#39;ll have to find a new delta on the fly.</p>
<p>
A similar situation may exist if you have many refs outside of
<strong>refs/heads/</strong> and <strong>refs/tags/</strong> that point to related objects (e.g.,
<strong>refs/pull</strong> or <strong>refs/changes</strong> used by some hosting providers). By
default, clients fetch only heads and tags, and deltas against objects
found only in those other groups cannot be sent as-is.</p>
<p>
Delta islands solve this problem by allowing you to group your refs into
distinct &#34;islands&#34;. Pack-objects computes which objects are reachable
from which islands, and refuses to make a delta from an object <strong>A</strong>
against a base which is not present in all of *A*s islands. This results
in slightly larger packs (because we miss some delta opportunities), but
guarantees that a fetch of one island will not have to recompute deltas
on the fly due to crossing island boundaries.</p>
<p>
When repacking with delta islands the delta window tends to get clogged
with candidates that are forbidden by the config. Repacking with a big
–window helps (and doesn&#39;t take as long as it otherwise might because
we can reject some object pairs based on islands before doing any
computation on the content).</p>
<p>
Islands are configured via the <strong>pack.island</strong> option, which can be
specified multiple times. Each value is a left-anchored regular
expressions matching refnames. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
[pack]
island = refs/heads/
island = refs/tags/
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
puts heads and tags into an island (whose name is the empty string; see
below for more on naming). Any refs which do not match those regular
expressions (e.g., <strong>refs/pull/123</strong>) is not in any island. Any object
which is reachable only from <strong>refs/pull/</strong> (but not heads or tags) is
therefore not a candidate to be used as a base for <strong>refs/heads/</strong>.</p>
<p>
Refs are grouped into islands based on their &#34;names&#34;, and two regexes
that produce the same name are considered to be in the same island. The
names are computed from the regexes by concatenating any capture groups
from the regex, with a <em>-</em> dash in between. (And if there are no capture
groups, then the name is the empty string, as in the above example.)
This allows you to create arbitrary numbers of islands. Only up to 14
such capture groups are supported though.</p>
<p>
For example, imagine you store the refs for each fork in
<strong>refs/virtual/ID</strong>, where <strong>ID</strong> is a numeric identifier. You might then
configure:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
[pack]
island = refs/virtual/([0-9]+)/heads/
island = refs/virtual/([0-9]+)/tags/
island = refs/virtual/([0-9]+)/(pull)/
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
That puts the heads and tags for each fork in their own island (named
&#34;1234&#34; or similar), and the pull refs for each go into their own
&#34;1234-pull&#34;.</p>
<p>
Note that we pick a single island for each regex to go into, using &#34;last
one wins&#34; ordering (which allows repo-specific config to take precedence
over user-wide config, and so forth).</p>
