    <h1>Manpages - openssl.1</h1>
    <p>is a cryptography toolkit implementing the Transport Layer Security</p>
<p>
network protocol, as well as related cryptography standards.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
program is a command line tool for using the various cryptography
functions of</p>
<p>
crypto library from the shell.</p>
<p>
The pseudo-commands</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
output a list</p>
<p>
of the names of all standard commands, message digest commands, or
cipher commands, respectively, that are available in the present</p>
<p>
utility.</p>
<p>
The pseudo-commands</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
list all cipher and message digest names, one entry per line. Aliases
are listed as:</p>
<p>
The pseudo-command</p>
<p>
lists all supported public key algorithms.</p>
<p>
The pseudo-command</p>
<p>
tests whether a command of the specified name is available. If</p>
<p>
does not exist, it returns 0 and prints</p>
<p>
otherwise it returns 1 and prints</p>
<p>
In both cases, the output goes to stdout and nothing is printed to
stderr. Additional command line arguments are always ignored. Since for
each cipher there is a command of the same name, this provides an easy
way for shell scripts to test for the availability of ciphers in the</p>
<p>
program.</p>
<p>
is not able to detect pseudo-commands such as</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
itself.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command is a diagnostic utility that can parse ASN.1 structures. It can
also be used to extract data from ASN.1 formatted data.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
Dump the first</p>
<p>
bytes of unknown data in hex form.</p>
<p>
Dump unknown data in hex form.</p>
<p>
Generate encoded data based on string</p>
<p>
file</p>
<p>
or both, using the format described in</p>
<p>
If only</p>
<p>
is present then the string is obtained from the default section using
the name</p>
<p>
The encoded data is passed through the ASN.1 parser and printed out as
though it came from a file; the contents can thus be examined and
written to a file using the</p>
<p>
option.</p>
<p>
Indent the output according to the</p>
<p>
of the structures.</p>
<p>
The input file to read from, or standard input if not specified.</p>
<p>
The input format.</p>
<p>
Number of bytes to parse; the default is until end of file.</p>
<p>
Do not output the parsed version of the input file.</p>
<p>
Starting offset to begin parsing; the default is start of file.</p>
<p>
A file containing additional object identifiers</p>
<p>
If an OID</p>
<p>
is not part of</p>
<p>
internal table, it will be represented in numerical form</p>
<p>
Each line consists of three columns: the first column is the OID in
numerical format and should be followed by whitespace. The second column
is the</p>
<p>
which is a single word followed by whitespace. The final column is the
rest of the line and is the</p>
<p>
displays the long name.</p>
<p>
The DER-encoded output file; the default is no encoded output (useful
when combined with</p>
<p>
Parse the content octets of the ASN.1 object starting at</p>
<p>
This option can be used multiple times to</p>
<p>
into a nested structure.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command is a minimal certificate authority (CA) application. It can be
used to sign certificate requests in a variety of forms and generate
certificate revocation lists (CRLs). It also maintains a text database
of issued certificates and their status.</p>
<p>
The options relevant to CAs are as follows:</p>
<p>
Batch mode. In this mode no questions will be asked and all certificates
will be certified automatically.</p>
<p>
The CA certificate file.</p>
<p>
Specify an alternative configuration file.</p>
<p>
If reading the serial from the text file as specified in the
configuration fails, create a new random serial to be used as the next
serial number.</p>
<p>
The number of days to certify the certificate for.</p>
<p>
Set the expiry date. The format of the date is [YY]YYMMDDHHMMSSZ, with
all four year digits required for dates from 2050 onwards.</p>
<p>
The section of the configuration file containing certificate extensions
to be added when a certificate is issued (defaults to</p>
<p>
unless the</p>
<p>
option is used). If no extension section is present, a V1 certificate is
created. If the extension section is present</p>
<p>
then a V3 certificate is created. See the</p>
<p>
manual page for details of the extension section format.</p>
<p>
An additional configuration</p>
<p>
to read certificate extensions from (using the default section unless
the</p>
<p>
option is also used).</p>
<p>
An input</p>
<p>
containing a single certificate request to be signed by the CA.</p>
<p>
If present, this should be the last option; all subsequent arguments are
assumed to be the names of files containing certificate requests.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
used to encrypt the private key. Since on some systems the command line
arguments are visible, this option should be used with caution.</p>
<p>
The private key to sign requests with.</p>
<p>
Private key file format. The default is</p>
<p>
The message digest to use. Possible values include</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
This option also applies to CRLs.</p>
<p>
This is a legacy option to make</p>
<p>
work with very old versions of the IE certificate enrollment control</p>
<p>
It used UniversalStrings for almost everything. Since the old control
has various security bugs, its use is strongly discouraged. The newer
control</p>
<p>
does not need this option.</p>
<p>
This option causes the</p>
<p>
argument to be interpreted with full support for multivalued RDNs, for
example</p>
<p>
If</p>
<p>
is not used, the UID value is set to</p>
<p>
Specifies the configuration file</p>
<p>
to use (overrides</p>
<p>
in the</p>
<p>
section).</p>
<p>
The DN of a certificate can contain the EMAIL field if present in the
request DN, however it is good policy just having the email set into the</p>
<p>
extension of the certificate. When this option is set, the EMAIL field
is removed from the certificate&#39;s subject and set only in the,
eventually present, extensions. The</p>
<p>
keyword can be used in the configuration file to enable this behaviour.</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t output the text form of a certificate to the output file.</p>
<p>
The output file to output certificates to. The default is standard
output. The certificate details will also be printed out to this file in
PEM format.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
to output certificates to. The certificate will be written to a file
consisting of the serial number in hex with</p>
<p>
appended.</p>
<p>
The key password source.</p>
<p>
Define the CA</p>
<p>
to use. The policy section in the configuration file consists of a set
of variables corresponding to certificate DN fields. The values may be
one of</p>
<p>
(the value must match the same field in the CA certificate),</p>
<p>
(the value must be present), or</p>
<p>
(the value may be present). Any fields not mentioned in the policy
section are silently deleted, unless the</p>
<p>
option is set, but this can be regarded more of a quirk than intended
behaviour.</p>
<p>
Normally, the DN order of a certificate is the same as the order of the
fields in the relevant policy section. When this option is set, the
order is the same as the request. This is largely for compatibility with
the older IE enrollment control which would only accept certificates if
their DNs matched the order of the request. This is not needed for
Xenroll.</p>
<p>
Indicates the issued certificates are to be signed with the key the
certificate requests were signed with, given with</p>
<p>
Certificate requests signed with a different key are ignored. If</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
are given,</p>
<p>
is ignored.</p>
<p>
A consequence of using</p>
<p>
is that the self-signed certificate appears among the entries in the
certificate database (see the configuration option</p>
<p>
and uses the same serial number counter as all other certificates signed
with the self-signed certificate.</p>
<p>
Pass options to the signature algorithm during sign or certify
operations. The names and values of these options are
algorithm-specific.</p>
<p>
A single self-signed certificate to be signed by the CA.</p>
<p>
Set the start date. The format of the date is [YY]YYMMDDHHMMSSZ, with
all four year digits required for dates from 2050 onwards.</p>
<p>
Supersedes the subject name given in the request. The</p>
<p>
must be formatted as</p>
<p>
characters may be escaped by</p>
<p>
no spaces are skipped.</p>
<p>
Interpret field values read from a terminal or obtained from a
configuration file as UTF-8 strings. By default, they are interpreted as
ASCII.</p>
<p>
Print extra details about the operations being performed.</p>
<p>
The options relevant to CRLs are as follows:</p>
<p>
This is the same as</p>
<p>
except the revocation reason is set to CACompromise.</p>
<p>
Set the revocation reason to keyCompromise and the compromise time to</p>
<p>
should be in GeneralizedTime format, i.e. YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZ.</p>
<p>
Set the CRL revocation reason code to certificateHold and the hold
instruction to</p>
<p>
which must be an OID. Although any OID can be used, only
holdInstructionNone (the use of which is discouraged by RFC 2459),
holdInstructionCallIssuer or holdInstructionReject will normally be
used.</p>
<p>
Revocation reason, where</p>
<p>
is one of: unspecified, keyCompromise, CACompromise, affiliationChanged,
superseded, cessationOfOperation, certificateHold or removeFromCRL. The
matching of</p>
<p>
is case insensitive. Setting any revocation reason will make the CRL v2.
In practice, removeFromCRL is not particularly useful because it is only
used in delta CRLs which are not currently implemented.</p>
<p>
The number of days before the next CRL is due. This is the days from now
to place in the CRL</p>
<p>
field.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
of the configuration file containing CRL extensions to include. If no
CRL extension section is present then a V1 CRL is created; if the CRL
extension section is present (even if it is empty) then a V2 CRL is
created. The CRL extensions specified are CRL extensions and not CRL
entry extensions. It should be noted that some software can&#39;t handle V2
CRLs. See the</p>
<p>
manual page for details of the extension section format.</p>
<p>
The number of hours before the next CRL is due.</p>
<p>
The number of seconds before the next CRL is due.</p>
<p>
Generate a CRL based on information in the index file.</p>
<p>
A</p>
<p>
containing a certificate to revoke.</p>
<p>
Show the status of the certificate with serial number</p>
<p>
Update the database index to purge expired certificates.</p>
<p>
Many of the options can be set in the</p>
<p>
section of the configuration file (or in the default section of the
configuration file), specified using</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
The options</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
are read directly from the</p>
<p>
section.</p>
<p>
Many of the configuration file options are identical to command line
options. Where the option is present in the configuration file and the
command line, the command line value is used. Where an option is
described as mandatory, then it must be present in the configuration
file or the command line equivalent</p>
<p>
used.</p>
<p>
The same as</p>
<p>
It gives the file containing the CA certificate. Mandatory.</p>
<p>
Determines how extensions in certificate requests should be handled. If
set to</p>
<p>
or this option is not present, then extensions are ignored and not
copied to the certificate. If set to</p>
<p>
then any extensions present in the request that are not already present
are copied to the certificate. If set to</p>
<p>
then all extensions in the request are copied to the certificate: if the
extension is already present in the certificate it is deleted first.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
option should be used with caution. If care is not taken, it can be a
security risk. For example, if a certificate request contains a</p>
<p>
extension with CA:TRUE and the</p>
<p>
value is set to</p>
<p>
and the user does not spot this when the certificate is displayed, then
this will hand the requester a valid CA certificate.</p>
<p>
This situation can be avoided by setting</p>
<p>
to</p>
<p>
and including</p>
<p>
with CA:FALSE in the configuration file. Then if the request contains a</p>
<p>
extension, it will be ignored.</p>
<p>
The main use of this option is to allow a certificate request to supply
values for certain extensions such as</p>
<p>
The same as</p>
<p>
A text file containing the next CRL number to use in hex. The CRL number
will be inserted in the CRLs only if this file exists. If this file is
present, it must contain a valid CRL number.</p>
<p>
The text database file to use. Mandatory. This file must be present,
though initially it will be empty.</p>
<p>
The same as the</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
options. These will only be used if neither command line option is
present. At least one of these must be present to generate a CRL.</p>
<p>
The same as the</p>
<p>
option. The number of days to certify a certificate for.</p>
<p>
The same as the</p>
<p>
option. Either this option or</p>
<p>
must be present.</p>
<p>
The same as the</p>
<p>
option. The message digest to use. Mandatory.</p>
<p>
The same as the</p>
<p>
option. The start date to certify a certificate for. If not set, the
current time is used.</p>
<p>
The same as</p>
<p>
If the EMAIL field is to be removed from the DN of the certificate,
simply set this to</p>
<p>
If not present, the default is to allow for the EMAIL field in the
certificate&#39;s DN.</p>
<p>
The same as</p>
<p>
These options allow the format used to display the certificate details
when asking the user to confirm signing. All the options supported by
the</p>
<p>
utilities&#39;</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
switches can be used here, except that</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
are permanently set and cannot be disabled (this is because the
certificate signature cannot be displayed because the certificate has
not been signed at this point).</p>
<p>
For convenience, the value</p>
<p>
is accepted by both to produce a reasonable output.</p>
<p>
If neither option is present, the format used in earlier versions of</p>
<p>
is used. Use of the old format is strongly discouraged because it only
displays fields mentioned in the</p>
<p>
section, mishandles multicharacter string types and does not display
extensions.</p>
<p>
The same as the</p>
<p>
command line option. It specifies the directory where new certificates
will be placed. Mandatory.</p>
<p>
This specifies a file containing additional object identifiers. Each
line of the file should consist of the numerical form of the object
identifier followed by whitespace, then the short name followed by
whitespace and finally the long name.</p>
<p>
This specifies a section in the configuration file containing extra
object identifiers. Each line should consist of the short name of the
object identifier followed by</p>
<p>
and the numerical form. The short and long names are the same when this
option is used.</p>
<p>
The same as</p>
<p>
Mandatory.</p>
<p>
The same as</p>
<p>
Same as the</p>
<p>
option. The file containing the CA private key. Mandatory.</p>
<p>
A text file containing the next serial number to use in hex. Mandatory.
This file must be present and contain a valid serial number.</p>
<p>
If the value</p>
<p>
is given, the valid certificate entries in the database must have unique
subjects. If the value</p>
<p>
is given, several valid certificate entries may have the exact same
subject. The default value is</p>
<p>
Note that it is valid in some circumstances for certificates to be
created without any subject. In cases where there are multiple
certificates without subjects this does not count as a duplicate.</p>
<p>
The same as</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command calculates a hash value of</p>
<p>
file in the specified directory list and creates symbolic links for each
file, where the name of the link is the hash value. See the</p>
<p>
manual page for how hash links are used.</p>
<p>
The links created are of the form</p>
<p>
where each</p>
<p>
is a hexadecimal character and</p>
<p>
is a single decimal digit. The hashes for CRLs look similar, except the
letter</p>
<p>
appears after the period, like this:</p>
<p>
When processing a directory,</p>
<p>
will first remove all links that have a name in that syntax and invalid
reference.</p>
<p>
Multiple objects may have the same hash; they will be indicated by
incrementing the</p>
<p>
value. Duplicates are found by comparing the full SHA256 fingerprint. A
warning will be displayed if a duplicate is found.</p>
<p>
A warning will also be displayed if there are files that cannot be
parsed as either a certificate or a CRL.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
Perform a dry-run, and do not make any changes.</p>
<p>
Print extra details about the processing.</p>
<p>
Specify the directories to process.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command converts the</p>
<p>
string from the format documented in</p>
<p>
into an ordered SSL cipher suite preference list. If no</p>
<p>
string is specified, the</p>
<p>
list is printed.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
Print a brief usage message.</p>
<p>
Only list ciphers that are supported by the TLS method.</p>
<p>
In combination with the</p>
<p>
option, list the ciphers which could be used if the specified protocol
version were negotiated.</p>
<p>
Verbose. List ciphers with cipher suite code in hex format, cipher name,
and a complete description of protocol version, key exchange,
authentication, encryption, and mac algorithms.</p>
<p>
Like</p>
<p>
but without cipher suite codes.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command handles S/MIME v3.1 mail. It can encrypt, decrypt, sign and
verify, compress and uncompress S/MIME messages.</p>
<p>
The MIME message must be sent without any blank lines between the
headers and the output. Some mail programs will automatically add a
blank line. Piping the mail directly to sendmail is one way to achieve
the correct format.</p>
<p>
The supplied message to be signed or encrypted must include the
necessary MIME headers or many S/MIME clients won&#39;t display it properly
(if at all). You can use the</p>
<p>
option to automatically add plain text headers.</p>
<p>
A &#34;signed and encrypted&#34; message is one where a signed message is then
encrypted. This can be produced by encrypting an already signed message.</p>
<p>
There are various operation options that set the type of operation to be
performed. The meaning of the other options varies according to the
operation type.</p>
<p>
Encrypt mail for the given recipient certificates. Input file is the
message to be encrypted. The output file is the encrypted mail in MIME
format. The actual CMS type is EnvelopedData. Note that no revocation
check is done for the recipient cert, so if that key has been
compromised, others may be able to decrypt the text.</p>
<p>
Decrypt mail using the supplied certificate and private key. Expects an
encrypted mail message in MIME format for the input file. The decrypted
mail is written to the output file.</p>
<p>
Sign mail using the supplied certificate and private key. Input file is
the message to be signed. The signed message in MIME format is written
to the output file.</p>
<p>
Verify signed mail. Expects a signed mail message on input and outputs
the signed data. Both clear text and opaque signing are supported.</p>
<p>
Take an input message and write out a PEM encoded CMS structure.</p>
<p>
Resign a message. Take an existing message and one or more new signers.
This operation uses an existing message digest when adding a new signer.
This means that attributes must be present in at least one existing
signer using the same message digest or this operation will fail.</p>
<p>
Create a CMS Data type.</p>
<p>
Output a content from the input CMS Data type.</p>
<p>
Create a CMS DigestedData type.</p>
<p>
Verify a CMS DigestedData type and output the content.</p>
<p>
Create a CMS CompressedData type. Must be compiled with zlib support for
this option to work.</p>
<p>
Uncompress a CMS CompressedData type and output the content. Must be
compiled with zlib support for this option to work.</p>
<p>
Encrypt a content using supplied symmetric key and algorithm using a CMS
EncryptedData type.</p>
<p>
Decrypt a CMS EncryptedData type using supplied symmetric key.</p>
<p>
Generate and output a signed receipt for the supplied message. The input
message must contain a signed receipt request. Functionality is
otherwise similar to the</p>
<p>
operation.</p>
<p>
Verify a signed receipt in file. The input message must contain the
original receipt request. Functionality is otherwise similar to the</p>
<p>
operation.</p>
<p>
The remaining options are as follows:</p>
<p>
The encryption algorithm to use. 128-, 192-, or 256-bit AES, 128-, 192-,
or 256-bit CAMELLIA, DES (56 bits), triple DES (168 bits), or 40-, 64-,
or 128-bit RC2, respectively; if not specified, triple DES is used. Only
used with</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
commands.</p>
<p>
Normally the input message is converted to &#34;canonical&#34; format which is
effectively using CR/LF as end of line, as required by the S/MIME
specification. When this option is present, no translation occurs. This
is useful when handling binary data which may not be in MIME format.</p>
<p>
A file containing trusted CA certificates, used with</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
A directory containing trusted CA certificates, used with</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
This directory must be a standard certificate directory: that is a hash
of each subject name (using</p>
<p>
should be linked to each certificate.</p>
<p>
Allows additional certificate revocation lists to be specified for
verification. The CRLs should be in PEM format.</p>
<p>
One or more certificates of message recipients: used when encrypting a
message.</p>
<p>
Allows additional certificates to be specified. When signing, these will
be included with the message. When verifying, these will be searched for
the signer&#39;s certificates. The certificates should be in PEM format.</p>
<p>
A file that any certificates contained in the message are written to.</p>
<p>
Set various certificate chain validation options. See the</p>
<p>
command for details.</p>
<p>
A file containing the detached content. This is only useful with the</p>
<p>
command. This is only usable if the CMS structure is using the detached
signature form where the content is not included. This option will
override any content if the input format is S/MIME and it uses the
multipart/signed MIME content type.</p>
<p>
Output a S/MIME message with CR/LF end of line.</p>
<p>
Set the CMS_DEBUG_DECRYPT flag when decrypting. This option should be
used with caution, since this can be used to disable the MMA attack
protection and return an error if no recipient can be found. See the</p>
<p>
manual page for details of the flag.</p>
<p>
The relevant mail headers. These are included outside the signed portion
of a message so they may be included manually. If signing then many
S/MIME mail clients check the signer&#39;s certificate&#39;s email address
matches that specified in the From: address.</p>
<p>
Set the encapsulated content type, used with</p>
<p>
If not supplied, the Data type is used. The type argument can be any
valid OID name in either text or numerical format.</p>
<p>
The input message to be encrypted or signed or the message to be
decrypted or verified.</p>
<p>
The input format for the CMS structure. The default is</p>
<p>
which reads an S/MIME format message.</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
format change this to expect PEM and DER format CMS structures instead.
This currently only affects the input format of the CMS structure; if no
CMS structure is being input (for example with</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
this option has no effect.</p>
<p>
The private key to use when signing or decrypting. This must match the
corresponding certificate. If this option is not specified then the
private key must be included in the certificate file specified with the</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
file. When signing, this option can be used multiple times to specify
successive keys.</p>
<p>
Input private key format. The default is</p>
<p>
Use subject key identifier to identify certificates instead of issuer
name and serial number. The supplied certificate must include a subject
key identifier extension. Supported by</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
operations.</p>
<p>
Set customised parameters for the preceding key or certificate for
encryption and signing. It can currently be used to set RSA-PSS for
signing, RSA-OAEP for encryption or to modify default parameters for
ECDH. This option can be used multiple times.</p>
<p>
The digest algorithm to use when signing or resigning. If not present
then the default digest algorithm for the signing key will be used
(usually SHA1).</p>
<p>
Do not verify the signer&#39;s attribute of a signature.</p>
<p>
Do not verify the content of a signed message.</p>
<p>
Do not verify the signer&#39;s certificate of a signed message.</p>
<p>
Do not include attributes. Normally when a message is signed a set of
attributes are included which include the signing time and supported
symmetric algorithms. With this option they are not included.</p>
<p>
Do not include the signer&#39;s certificate. This will reduce the size of
the signed message but the verifier must have a copy of the signer&#39;s
certificate available locally (passed using the</p>
<p>
option for example).</p>
<p>
When signing a message, use opaque signing. This form is more resistant
to translation by mail relays but it cannot be read by mail agents that
do not support S/MIME. Without this option cleartext signing with the
MIME type multipart/signed is used.</p>
<p>
Only the certificates specified in the</p>
<p>
option are used. When verifying a message, normally certificates (if
any) included in the message are searched for the signing certificate.
The supplied certificates can still be used as untrusted CAs however.</p>
<p>
Output an old S/MIME content type like &#34;application/x-pkcs7-&#34;.</p>
<p>
Do not output the parsed CMS structure for the</p>
<p>
operation. This is useful when combined with the</p>
<p>
option or if the syntax of the CMS structure is being checked.</p>
<p>
Do not try to verify the signatures on the message.</p>
<p>
Exclude the list of supported algorithms from signed attributes; other
options such as signing time and content type are still included.</p>
<p>
Do not verify the signer&#39;s certificate of a signed message.</p>
<p>
The message text that has been decrypted or verified or the output MIME
format message that has been signed or verified.</p>
<p>
This specifies the output format for the CMS structure. The default is</p>
<p>
which writes an S/MIME format message.</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
format change this to write PEM and DER format CMS structures instead.
This currently only affects the output format of the CMS structure; if
no CMS structure is being output (for example with</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
this option has no effect.</p>
<p>
The private key password source.</p>
<p>
Print out all fields of the CMS structure for the</p>
<p>
operation. This is mainly useful for testing purposes.</p>
<p>
Specify PasswordRecipientInfo (PWRI) password to use. Supported by the</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
operations.</p>
<p>
Specify the format for a signed receipt for use with the</p>
<p>
operation. The default is</p>
<p>
Indicate requests should be provided by all recipient or first tier
recipients (those mailed directly and not from a mailing list), for the</p>
<p>
operation to include a signed receipt request. Ignored if</p>
<p>
is included.</p>
<p>
Add an explicit email address where receipts should be supplied.</p>
<p>
Print out the contents of any signed receipt requests for the</p>
<p>
operation.</p>
<p>
Add an explicit email address where signed receipts should be sent to.
This option must be supplied if a signed receipt is requested.</p>
<p>
When decrypting a message, this specifies the recipient&#39;s certificate.
The certificate must match one of the recipients of the message or an
error occurs. When encrypting a message, this option may be used
multiple times to specify each recipient. This form must be used if
customised parameters are required (for example to specify RSA-OAEP).
Only certificates carrying RSA, Diffie-Hellman or EC keys are supported
by this option.</p>
<p>
Specify symmetric key to use. The key must be supplied in hex format and
be consistent with the algorithm used. Supported by the</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
operations. When used with</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
the supplied key is used to wrap or unwrap the content encryption key
using an AES key in the KEKRecipientInfo type.</p>
<p>
The key identifier for the supplied symmetric key for KEKRecipientInfo
type. This option must be present if the</p>
<p>
option is used with</p>
<p>
With</p>
<p>
operations the id is used to locate the relevant key; if it is not
supplied then an attempt is used to decrypt any KEKRecipientInfo
structures.</p>
<p>
A signing certificate when signing or resigning a message; this option
can be used multiple times if more than one signer is required. If a
message is being verified then the signers certificates will be written
to this file if the verification was successful.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
options are equivalent and enable streaming I/O for encoding operations.
This permits single pass processing of data without the need to hold the
entire contents in memory, potentially supporting very large files.
Streaming is automatically set for S/MIME signing with detached data if
the output format is</p>
<p>
it is currently off by default for all other operations.</p>
<p>
disable streaming I/O where it would produce an indefinite length
constructed encoding. This option currently has no effect.</p>
<p>
Add plain text (text/plain) MIME headers to the supplied message if
encrypting or signing. If decrypting or verifying, it strips off text
headers: if the decrypted or verified message is not of MIME type
text/plain then an error occurs.</p>
<p>
Set verification error code to exit code to indicate what verification
error has occurred. Supported by</p>
<p>
operation only. Exit code value minus 32 shows verification error code.
See</p>
<p>
command for the list of verification error code.</p>
<p>
The exit codes for</p>
<p>
are as follows:</p>
<p>
The operation was completely successful.</p>
<p>
An error occurred parsing the command options.</p>
<p>
One of the input files could not be read.</p>
<p>
An error occurred creating the CMS file or when reading the MIME
message.</p>
<p>
An error occurred decrypting or verifying the message.</p>
<p>
The message was verified correctly but an error occurred writing out the
signer&#39;s certificates.</p>
<p>
An error occurred writing the output file.</p>
<p>
A verify error occurred while</p>
<p>
is specified.</p>

<p>
The</p>
<p>
command takes an optional CRL and one or more certificates and converts
them into a PKCS#7 degenerate</p>
<p>
structure.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
Add the certificates in PEM</p>
<p>
to the PKCS#7 structure. This option can be used more than once to read
certificates from multiple files.</p>
<p>
Read the CRL from</p>
<p>
or standard input if not specified.</p>
<p>
The input format.</p>
<p>
Normally, a CRL is included in the output file. With this option, no CRL
is included in the output file and a CRL is not read from the input
file.</p>
<p>
Write the PKCS#7 structure to</p>
<p>
or standard output if not specified.</p>
<p>
The output format.</p>
<p>
The digest functions output the message digest of a supplied</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
in hexadecimal form. They can also be used for digital signing and
verification.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
Output the digest or signature in binary form.</p>
<p>
Print the digest in two-digit groups separated by colons.</p>
<p>
Print BIO debugging information.</p>
<p>
Use the specified message</p>
<p>
The default is SHA256. The available digests can be displayed using</p>
<p>
The following are equivalent:</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
Digest is to be output as a hex dump. This is the default case for a</p>
<p>
digest as opposed to a digital signature.</p>
<p>
Create a hashed MAC using</p>
<p>
Specifies the key format to sign the digest with.</p>
<p>
Create a keyed Message Authentication Code (MAC). The most popular MAC
algorithm is HMAC (hash-based MAC), but there are other MAC algorithms
which are not based on hash. MAC keys and other options should be set
via the</p>
<p>
parameter.</p>
<p>
Passes options to the MAC algorithm, specified by</p>
<p>
The following options are supported by HMAC:</p>
<p>
Specifies the MAC key as an alphanumeric string (use if the key contain
printable characters only). String length must conform to any
restrictions of the MAC algorithm.</p>
<p>
Specifies the MAC key in hexadecimal form (two hex digits per byte). Key
length must conform to any restrictions of the MAC algorithm.</p>
<p>
The output file to write to, or standard output if not specified.</p>
<p>
The key password source.</p>
<p>
Verify the signature using the private key in</p>

algorithm-specific.</p>
<p>
Verify the signature using the public key in</p>
<p>
The output is either</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
File or files to digest. If no files are specified then standard input
is used.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command is used to manipulate DH parameter files. Only the older PKCS#3
DH is supported, not the newer X9.42 DH.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
The generator to use; 2 is the default. If present, the input file is
ignored and parameters are generated instead.</p>
<p>
Convert the parameters into C code. The parameters can then be loaded by
calling the</p>
<p>
function.</p>
<p>
Check the DH parameters.</p>
<p>
Read or create DSA parameters, converted to DH format on output.
Otherwise,</p>
<p>
primes</p>
<p>
will be used for DH parameter generation.</p>
<p>
DH parameter generation with the</p>
<p>
option is much faster, and the recommended exponent length is shorter,
which makes DH key exchange more efficient. Beware that with such
DSA-style DH parameters, a fresh DH key should be created for each use
to avoid small-subgroup attacks that may be possible otherwise.</p>

It must be the last option. If not present, a value of 2048 is used. If
this value is present, the input file is ignored and parameters are
generated instead.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command processes DSA keys. They can be converted between various forms
and their components printed out.</p>
<p>
This command uses the traditional</p>
<p>
compatible format for private key encryption: newer applications should
use the more secure PKCS#8 format using the</p>
<p>
command.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
Encrypt the private key with the AES, DES, or the triple DES ciphers,
respectively, before outputting it. A pass phrase is prompted for. If
none of these options are specified, the key is written in plain text.
This means that using the</p>
<p>
utility to read an encrypted key with no encryption option can be used
to remove the pass phrase from a key, or by setting the encryption
options it can be used to add or change the pass phrase. These options
can only be used with PEM format output files.</p>
<p>
The input file to read from, or standard input if not specified. If the
key is encrypted, a pass phrase will be prompted for.</p>

<p>
The symmetric cipher commands allow data to be encrypted or decrypted
using various block and stream ciphers using keys based on passwords or
explicitly provided. Base64 encoding or decoding can also be performed
either by itself or in addition to the encryption or decryption. The
program can be called either as</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
Some of the ciphers do not have large keys and others have security
implications if not used correctly. All the block ciphers normally use
PKCS#5 padding, also known as standard block padding. If padding is
disabled, the input data must be a multiple of the cipher block length.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
If the</p>
<p>
option is set, then base64 process the data on one line.</p>
<p>
Base64 process the data. This means that if encryption is taking place,
the data is base64-encoded after encryption. If decryption is set, the
input data is base64-decoded before being decrypted.</p>
<p>
Set the buffer size for I/O.</p>
<p>
Decrypt the input data.</p>
<p>
Debug the BIOs used for I/O.</p>
<p>
Encrypt the input data. This is the default.</p>

<p>
Use the pbkdf2 key derivation function, with</p>
<p>
as the number of iterations.</p>
<p>
The actual</p>
<p>
to use: this must be represented as a string comprised only of hex
digits. When only the</p>
<p>
is specified using the</p>
<p>
option, the IV must explicitly be defined. When a password is being
specified using one of the other options, the IV is generated from this
password.</p>
<p>
The actual</p>
<p>
to use: this must be represented as a string comprised only of hex
digits. If only the key is specified, the IV must also be specified
using the</p>
<p>
option. When both a</p>
<p>
and a</p>
<p>
are specified, the</p>
<p>
given with the</p>
<p>
option will be used and the IV generated from the password will be
taken. It probably does not make much sense to specify both</p>

Use NULL cipher (no encryption or decryption of input).</p>
<p>
Disable standard block padding.</p>

Don&#39;t use a salt in the key derivation routines. This option should
never be used since it makes it possible to perform efficient dictionary
attacks on the password and to attack stream cipher encrypted data.</p>

The output file to write to, or standard output if not specified.</p>
<p>
Print out the salt, key, and IV used, then immediately exit; don&#39;t do
any encryption or decryption.</p>

The password source.</p>
<p>
Use the pbkdf2 key derivation function, with the default of 10000
iterations.</p>
<p>
The actual</p>
<p>
to use: this must be represented as a string comprised only of hex
digits.</p>
<p>
Use a salt in the key derivation routines (the default). When the salt
is being used, the first eight bytes of the encrypted data are reserved
for the salt: it is randomly generated when encrypting a file and read
from the encrypted file when it is decrypted.</p>
<p>
Print extra details about the processing.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command performs error number to error string conversion, generating a
human-readable string representing the error code</p>
<p>
The string is obtained through the</p>
<p>
function and has the following format:</p>
<p>
is an 8-digit hexadecimal number. The remaining fields</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
are all ASCII text.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command generates a DSA private key from a DSA parameter file (typically
generated by the</p>
<p>
command). DSA key generation is little more than random number
generation so it is much quicker than, for example, RSA key generation.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
Encrypt the private key with the AES, CAMELLIA, DES, triple DES or the
IDEA ciphers, respectively, before outputting it. A pass phrase is
prompted for. If none of these options are specified, no encryption is
used.</p>
<p>
The output file to write to, or standard output if not specified.</p>
<p>
The output file password source.</p>
<p>
Specify the DSA parameter file to use. The parameters in this file
determine the size of the private key.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command generates private keys. The use of this program is encouraged
over the algorithm specific utilities because additional algorithm
options can be used.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
The public key algorithm to use, such as RSA, DSA, or DH. This option
must precede any</p>
<p>
options. The options</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
are mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>
Encrypt the private key with the supplied cipher. Any algorithm name
accepted by</p>
<p>
is acceptable.</p>
<p>
Generate a set of parameters instead of a private key. This option must
precede any</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
options.</p>
<p>
The output file to write to, or standard output if not specified.</p>
<p>
The output format.</p>
<p>
Some public key algorithms generate a private key based on a set of
parameters, which can be supplied using this option. If this option is
used, the public key algorithm used is determined by the parameters.
This option must precede any</p>
<p>
options. The options</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
are mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>
The output file password source.</p>
<p>
Set the public key algorithm option</p>
<p>
to</p>
<p>
as follows:</p>
<p>
(RSA) The number of bits in the generated key. The default is 2048.</p>
<p>
(RSA) The RSA public exponent value. This can be a large decimal or
hexadecimal value if preceded by 0x. The default is 65537.</p>
<p>
(DSA) The number of bits in the generated parameters. The default
is 1024.</p>
<p>
(DH) The number of bits in the prime parameter</p>
<p>
(DH) The value to use for the generator</p>
<p>
(EC) The elliptic curve to use.</p>
<p>
Print the private/public key in plain text.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command generates an RSA private key, which essentially involves the
generation of two prime numbers. When generating the key, various
symbols will be output to indicate the progress of the generation. A</p>
<p>
represents each number which has passed an initial sieve test;</p>
<p>
means a number has passed a single round of the Miller-Rabin primality
test;</p>
<p>
means the number has failed primality testing and needs to be generated
afresh. A newline means that the number has passed all the prime tests
(the actual number depends on the key size).</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
The public exponent to use, either 3 or 65537. The default is 65537.</p>
<p>
Encrypt the private key with the AES, CAMELLIA, DES, triple DES or the
IDEA ciphers, respectively, before outputting it. If none of these
options are specified, no encryption is used. If encryption is used, a
pass phrase is prompted for, if it is not supplied via the</p>
<p>
option.</p>
<p>
The output file to write to, or standard output if not specified.</p>
<p>
The output file password source.</p>
<p>
The size of the private key to generate in bits. This must be the last
option specified. The default is 2048.</p>
<p>
The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) enables applications to
determine the (revocation) state of an identified certificate (RFC
2560).</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command performs many common OCSP tasks. It can be used to print out
requests and responses, create requests and send queries to an OCSP
responder, and behave like a mini OCSP server itself.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
A file or path containing trusted CA certificates, used to verify the
signature on the OCSP response.</p>
<p>
Add the certificate</p>
<p>
to the request. The issuer certificate is taken from the previous</p>
<p>
option, or an error occurs if no issuer certificate is specified.</p>
<p>
Use the digest algorithm</p>
<p>
for certificate identification in the OCSP request. By default SHA1 is
used.</p>
<p>
Send the OCSP request to</p>
<p>
on</p>
<p>
specifies the HTTP path name to use, or</p>
<p>
by default.</p>
<p>
Add the header name with the specified value to the OCSP request that is
sent to the responder. This may be repeated.</p>
<p>
The current issuer certificate, in PEM format. Can be used multiple
times and must come before any</p>
<p>
options.</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t perform any additional checks on the OCSP response signer&#39;s
certificate. That is, do not make any checks to see if the signer&#39;s
certificate is authorised to provide the necessary status information:
as a result this option should only be used for testing purposes.</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t verify the OCSP response signer&#39;s certificate at all. Since this
option allows the OCSP response to be signed by any certificate, it
should only be used for testing purposes.</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t include any certificates in the signed request.</p>
<p>
Do not use certificates in the response as additional untrusted CA
certificates.</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t check the explicit trust for OCSP signing in the root CA
certificate.</p>
<p>
Ignore certificates contained in the OCSP response when searching for
the signer&#39;s certificate. The signer&#39;s certificate must be specified
with either the</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
options.</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t check the signature on the OCSP response. Since this option
tolerates invalid signatures on OCSP responses, it will normally only be
used for testing purposes.</p>
<p>
Add an OCSP nonce extension to a request, or disable an OCSP nonce
addition. Normally, if an OCSP request is input using the</p>
<p>
option no nonce is added: using the</p>
<p>
option will force the addition of a nonce. If an OCSP request is being
created (using the</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
options), a nonce is automatically added; specifying</p>
<p>
overrides this.</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t attempt to verify the OCSP response signature or the nonce values.
This is normally only be used for debugging since it disables all
verification of the responder&#39;s certificate.</p>
<p>
Specify the output file to write to, or standard output if not
specified.</p>
<p>
Print out the text form of the OCSP request, response, or both,
respectively.</p>
<p>
Read an OCSP request or response file from</p>
<p>
These options are ignored if an OCSP request or response creation is
implied by other options (for example with the</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
options).</p>
<p>
Write out the DER-encoded certificate request or response to</p>
<p>
Same as the</p>
<p>
option except the certificate with serial number</p>
<p>
is added to the request. The serial number is interpreted as a decimal
integer unless preceded by</p>
<p>
Negative integers can also be specified by preceding the value with a
minus sign.</p>
<p>
Additional certificates to include in the signed request.</p>
<p>
Sign the OCSP request using the certificate specified in the</p>
<p>
option and the private key specified by the</p>
<p>
option. If the</p>
<p>
option is not present, then the private key is read from the same file
as the certificate. If neither option is specified, the OCSP request is
not signed.</p>
<p>
Connection timeout to the OCSP responder in seconds.</p>
<p>
The certificates specified by the</p>
<p>
option should be explicitly trusted and no additional checks will be
performed on them. This is useful when the complete responder
certificate chain is not available or trusting a root CA is not
appropriate.</p>
<p>
Specify the responder URL. Both HTTP and HTTPS</p>
<p>
URLs can be specified.</p>
<p>
A file containing explicitly trusted responder certificates. Equivalent
to the</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
options.</p>
<p>
The range of times, in seconds, which will be tolerated in an OCSP
response. Each certificate status response includes a notBefore time and
an optional notAfter time. The current time should fall between these
two values, but the interval between the two times may be only a few
seconds. In practice the OCSP responder and clients&#39; clocks may not be
precisely synchronised and so such a check may fail. To avoid this the</p>
<p>
option can be used to specify an acceptable error range in seconds, the
default value being 5 minutes.</p>
<p>
If the notAfter time is omitted from a response, it means that new
status information is immediately available. In this case the age of the
notBefore field is checked to see it is not older than</p>
<p>
seconds old. By default, this additional check is not performed.</p>
<p>
A file containing additional certificates to search when attempting to
locate the OCSP response signing certificate. Some responders omit the
actual signer&#39;s certificate from the response, so this can be used to
supply the necessary certificate.</p>
<p>
The options for the OCSP server are as follows:</p>
<p>
CA certificate corresponding to the revocation information in</p>
<p>
Ignore the invalid response.</p>
<p>
is a text index file in ca format containing certificate revocation
information.</p>
<p>
If this option is specified,</p>
<p>
is in responder mode, otherwise it is in client mode. The requests the
responder processes can be either specified on the command line (using
the</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
options), supplied in a file (using the</p>
<p>
option), or via external OCSP clients (if</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
is specified).</p>
<p>
If this option is present, then the</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
options must also be present.</p>
<p>
Number of</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
when fresh revocation information is available: used in the nextUpdate
field. If neither option is present, the nextUpdate field is omitted,
meaning fresh revocation information is immediately available.</p>
<p>
Exit after receiving</p>
<p>
requests (the default is unlimited).</p>
<p>
Port to listen for OCSP requests on. May also be specified using the</p>
<p>
option.</p>
<p>
Identify the signer certificate using the key ID; the default is to use
the subject name.</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t include any certificates in the OCSP response.</p>
<p>
The private key to sign OCSP responses with; if not present, the file
specified in the</p>
<p>
option is used.</p>
<p>
Additional certificates to include in the OCSP response.</p>
<p>
The certificate to sign OCSP responses with.</p>
<p>
Initially the OCSP responder certificate is located and the signature on
the OCSP request checked using the responder certificate&#39;s public key.
Then a normal certificate verify is performed on the OCSP responder
certificate building up a certificate chain in the process. The
locations of the trusted certificates used to build the chain can be
specified by the</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
options or they will be looked for in the standard</p>
<p>
certificates directory.</p>
<p>
If the initial verify fails, the OCSP verify process halts with an
error. Otherwise the issuing CA certificate in the request is compared
to the OCSP responder certificate: if there is a match then the OCSP
verify succeeds.</p>
<p>
Otherwise the OCSP responder certificate&#39;s CA is checked against the
issuing CA certificate in the request. If there is a match and the
OCSPSigning extended key usage is present in the OCSP responder
certificate, then the OCSP verify succeeds.</p>
<p>
Otherwise the root CA of the OCSP responder&#39;s CA is checked to see if it
is trusted for OCSP signing. If it is, the OCSP verify succeeds.</p>
<p>
If none of these checks is successful, the OCSP verify fails. What this
effectively means is that if the OCSP responder certificate is
authorised directly by the CA it is issuing revocation information about
(and it is correctly configured), then verification will succeed.</p>
<p>
If the OCSP responder is a global responder, which can give details
about multiple CAs and has its own separate certificate chain, then its
root CA can be trusted for OCSP signing. Alternatively, the responder
certificate itself can be explicitly trusted with the</p>
<p>
option.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command computes the hash of a password.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
Use the MD5 based</p>
<p>
password algorithm</p>
<p>
Use the</p>
<p>
algorithm</p>
<p>
Apache variant of the</p>
<p>
algorithm</p>
<p>
Use the</p>
<p>
algorithm (the default).</p>
<p>
Read passwords from</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t verify when reading a password from the terminal.</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t output warnings when passwords given on the command line are
truncated.</p>
<p>
Switch table columns. This only makes sense in conjunction with the</p>
<p>
option.</p>
<p>
Use the salt specified by</p>
<p>
When reading a password from the terminal, this implies</p>
<p>
Read passwords from standard input.</p>
<p>
In the output list, prepend the cleartext password and a TAB character
to each password hash.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command processes PKCS#7 files in DER or PEM format. The PKCS#7 routines
only understand PKCS#7 v 1.5 as specified in RFC 2315.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
The input file to read from, or standard input if not specified.</p>
<p>
The input format.</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t output the encoded version of the PKCS#7 structure (or
certificates if</p>
<p>
is set).</p>
<p>
The output to write to, or standard output if not specified.</p>
<p>
The output format.</p>
<p>
Print the ASN.1 representation of PKCS#7 structure.</p>
<p>
Print any certificates or CRLs contained in the file, preceded by their
subject and issuer names in a one-line format.</p>
<p>
Print certificate details in full rather than just subject and issuer
names.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command processes private keys (both encrypted and unencrypted) in
PKCS#8 format with a variety of PKCS#5 (v1.5 and v2.0) and PKCS#12
algorithms. The default encryption is only 56 bits; keys encrypted using
PKCS#5 v2.0 algorithms and high iteration counts are more secure.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
The input file to read from, or standard input if not specified. If the
key is encrypted, a pass phrase will be prompted for.</p>
<p>
The input format.</p>
<p>
Generate an unencrypted PrivateKeyInfo structure. This option does not
encrypt private keys at all and should only be used when absolutely
necessary.</p>
<p>
Use an iteration count of 1. See the</p>
<p>
section below for a detailed explanation of this option.</p>
<p>
The output file to write to, or standard output if none is specified. If
any encryption options are set, a pass phrase will be prompted for.</p>
<p>
The output format.</p>
<p>
The key password source.</p>
<p>
The output file password source.</p>
<p>
Read a traditional format private key and write a PKCS#8 format key.</p>
<p>
Specify a PKCS#5 v1.5 or PKCS#12 algorithm to use.</p>
<p>
56-bit DES.</p>
<p>
64-bit RC2 or 56-bit DES.</p>
<p>
PKCS#12 password-based encryption algorithm, which allow strong
encryption algorithms like triple DES or 128-bit RC2.</p>
<p>
Use PKCS#5 v2.0 algorithms. Supports algorithms such as 168-bit triple
DES or 128-bit RC2, however not many implementations support PKCS#5 v2.0
yet (if using private keys with</p>
<p>
this doesn&#39;t matter).</p>
<p>
is the encryption algorithm to use; valid values include des, des3, and
rc2. It is recommended that des3 is used.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command allows PKCS#12 files</p>
<p>
to be created and parsed. By default, a PKCS#12 file is parsed; a
PKCS#12 file can be created by using the</p>
<p>
option.</p>
<p>
The options for parsing a PKCS12 file are as follows:</p>
<p>
Encrypt private keys using AES, CAMELLIA, DES, triple DES or the IDEA
ciphers, respectively. The default is triple DES.</p>
<p>
Only output CA certificates</p>
<p>
Only output client certificates</p>
<p>
The input file to read from, or standard input if not specified.</p>
<p>
Output additional information about the PKCS#12 file structure,
algorithms used, and iteration counts.</p>
<p>
Do not output certificates.</p>
<p>
Do not encrypt private keys.</p>
<p>
Do not output private keys.</p>
<p>
Do not attempt to verify the integrity MAC before reading the file.</p>
<p>
Do not output the keys and certificates to the output file version of
the PKCS#12 file.</p>
<p>
The output file to write to, or standard output if not specified.</p>
<p>
The key password source.</p>
<p>
The output file password source.</p>
<p>
Prompt for separate integrity and encryption passwords: most software
always assumes these are the same so this option will render such
PKCS#12 files unreadable.</p>
<p>
The options for PKCS12 file creation are as follows:</p>
<p>
CA storage as a file.</p>
<p>
CA storage as a directory. The directory must be a standard certificate
directory: that is, a hash of each subject name (using</p>
<p>
should be linked to each certificate.</p>
<p>
Specify the</p>
<p>
for other certificates. May be used multiple times to specify names for
all certificates in the order they appear.</p>
<p>
A file to read additional certificates from.</p>
<p>
Specify the algorithm used to encrypt the private key and certificates
to be selected. Any PKCS#5 v1.5 or PKCS#12 PBE algorithm name can be
used. If a cipher name (as output by the</p>
<p>
command) is specified then it is used with PKCS#5 v2.0. For
interoperability reasons it is advisable to only use PKCS#12 algorithms.</p>
<p>
Include the entire certificate chain of the user certificate. The
standard CA store is used for this search. If the search fails, it is
considered a fatal error.</p>
<p>
Encrypt the certificate using triple DES; this may render the PKCS#12
file unreadable by some</p>
<p>
software. By default, the private key is encrypted using triple DES and
the certificate using 40-bit RC2.</p>
<p>
Create a PKCS#12 file (rather than parsing one).</p>
<p>
The input file to read from, or standard input if not specified. The
order doesn&#39;t matter but one private key and its corresponding
certificate should be present. If additional certificates are present,
they will also be included in the PKCS#12 file.</p>
<p>
File to read a private key from. If not present, a private key must be
present in the input file.</p>
<p>
Specify whether the private key is to be used for key exchange or just
signing. Normally,</p>
<p>
software will only allow 512-bit RSA keys to be used for encryption
purposes, but arbitrary length keys for signing. The</p>
<p>
option marks the key for signing only. Signing only keys can be used for
S/MIME signing, authenticode (ActiveX control signing) and SSL client
authentication.</p>
<p>
Specify the MAC digest algorithm. The default is SHA1.</p>
<p>
Included for compatibility only: it used to be needed to use MAC
iterations counts but they are now used by default.</p>
<p>
Specify the</p>
<p>
for the certificate and private key. This name is typically displayed in
list boxes by software importing the file.</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t attempt to provide the MAC integrity.</p>
<p>
Affect the iteration counts on the MAC and key algorithms.</p>
<p>
To discourage attacks by using large dictionaries of common passwords,
the algorithm that derives keys from passwords can have an iteration
count applied to it: this causes a certain part of the algorithm to be
repeated and slows it down. The MAC is used to check the file integrity
but since it will normally have the same password as the keys and
certificates it could also be attacked. By default, both MAC and
encryption iteration counts are set to 2048; using these options the MAC
and encryption iteration counts can be set to 1. Since this reduces the
file security, you should not use these options unless you really have
to. Most software supports both MAC and key iteration counts.</p>
<p>
The output file to write to, or standard output if not specified.</p>
<p>
The key password source.</p>
<p>
The output file password source.</p>
<p>
With</p>
<p>
is equivalent to</p>
<p>
Otherwise,</p>
<p>
is equivalent to</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command processes public or private keys. They can be converted between
various forms and their components printed out.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
Encrypt the private key with the specified cipher. Any algorithm name
accepted by</p>
<p>
is acceptable, such as</p>
<p>
The input file to read from, or standard input if not specified. If the
key is encrypted, a pass phrase will be prompted for.</p>
<p>
The input format.</p>
<p>
Do not output the encoded version of the key.</p>
<p>
The output file to write to, or standard output if not specified. If any
encryption options are set then a pass phrase will be prompted for.</p>
<p>
The output format.</p>
<p>
The key password source.</p>
<p>
The output file password source.</p>
<p>
Read in a public key, not a private key.</p>
<p>
Output a public key, not a private key. Automatically set if the input
is a public key.</p>
<p>
Print the public/private key in plain text.</p>
<p>
Print out only public key components even if a private key is being
processed.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command processes public or private keys. The key type is determined by
the PEM headers.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
The input file to read from, or standard input if not specified.</p>
<p>
Do not output the encoded version of the parameters.</p>
<p>
The output file to write to, or standard output if not specified.</p>
<p>
Print the parameters in plain text.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command can be used to perform public key operations using any supported
algorithm.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
ASN.1 parse the output data. This is useful when combined with the</p>
<p>
option when an ASN.1 structure is signed.</p>
<p>
The input is a certificate containing a public key.</p>
<p>
Decrypt the input data using a private key.</p>
<p>
Derive a shared secret using the peer key.</p>
<p>
Encrypt the input data using a public key.</p>
<p>
Hex dump the output data.</p>
<p>
The input file to read from, or standard input if not specified.</p>
<p>
The input key file. By default it should be a private key.</p>
<p>
The key format.</p>
<p>
The output file to write to, or standard output if not specified.</p>
<p>
The key password source.</p>
<p>
The peer key format.</p>
<p>
The peer key file, used by key derivation (agreement) operations.</p>
<p>
Set the public key algorithm option</p>
<p>
to</p>
<p>
Unless otherwise mentioned, all algorithms support the format</p>
<p>
which specifies the digest to use for sign, verify, and verifyrecover
operations. The value</p>
<p>
should represent a digest name as used in the</p>
<p>
function.</p>
<p>
The RSA algorithm supports the encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify, and
verifyrecover operations in general. Some padding modes only support
some of these operations however.</p>
<p>
This sets the RSA padding mode. Acceptable values for</p>
<p>
are</p>
<p>
for PKCS#1 padding;</p>
<p>
for no padding;</p>
<p>
for OAEP mode;</p>
<p>
for X9.31 mode; and</p>
<p>
for PSS.</p>
<p>
In PKCS#1 padding if the message digest is not set then the supplied
data is signed or verified directly instead of using a DigestInfo
structure. If a digest is set then a DigestInfo structure is used and
its length must correspond to the digest type. For oeap mode only
encryption and decryption is supported. For x931 if the digest type is
set it is used to format the block data; otherwise the first byte is
used to specify the X9.31 digest ID. Sign, verify, and verifyrecover can
be performed in this mode. For pss mode only sign and verify are
supported and the digest type must be specified.</p>
<p>
For pss mode only this option specifies the salt length. Two special
values are supported: -1 sets the salt length to the digest length. When
signing, -2 sets the salt length to the maximum permissible value. When
verifying, -2 causes the salt length to be automatically determined
based on the PSS block structure.</p>
<p>
The DSA algorithm supports the sign and verify operations. Currently
there are no additional options other than</p>
<p>
Only the SHA1 digest can be used and this digest is assumed by default.</p>
<p>
The DH algorithm supports the derive operation and no additional
options.</p>
<p>
The EC algorithm supports the sign, verify, and derive operations. The
sign and verify operations use ECDSA and derive uses ECDH. Currently
there are no additional options other than</p>
<p>
Only the SHA1 digest can be used and this digest is assumed by default.</p>
<p>
The input file is a public key.</p>
<p>
Reverse the order of the input buffer.</p>
<p>
Signature file (verify operation only).</p>
<p>
Sign the input data and output the signed result. This requires a
private key.</p>
<p>
Verify the input data against the signature file and indicate if the
verification succeeded or failed.</p>
<p>
Verify the input data and output the recovered data.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command is used to generate prime numbers, or to check numbers for
primality. Results are probabilistic: they have an exceedingly high
likelihood of being correct, but are not guaranteed.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
Specify the number of bits in the generated prime number. Must be used
in conjunction with</p>
<p>
Perform a Miller-Rabin probabilistic primality test with</p>
<p>
iterations. The default is 20.</p>
<p>
Generate a pseudo-random prime number. Must be used in conjunction with</p>
<p>
Output in hex format.</p>
<p>
Generate only</p>
<p>
prime numbers (i.e. a prime p so that (p-1)/2 is also prime).</p>
<p>
Test if number</p>
<p>
is prime.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command outputs</p>
<p>
pseudo-random bytes.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
Perform base64 encoding on the output.</p>
<p>
Specify hexadecimal output.</p>
<p>
The output file to write to, or standard output if not specified.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command primarily creates and processes certificate requests in PKCS#10
format. It can additionally create self-signed certificates, for use as
root CAs, for example.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
Add a specific extension to the certificate (if the</p>
<p>
option is present) or certificate request. The argument must have the
form of a key=value pair as it would appear in a config file. This
option can be given multiple times.</p>
<p>
Non-interactive mode.</p>
<p>
Specify an alternative configuration file.</p>
<p>
Specify the number of days to certify the certificate for. The default
is 30 days. Used with the</p>
<p>
option.</p>
<p>
Specify alternative sections to include certificate extensions (with</p>
<p>
or certificate request extensions, allowing several different sections
to be used in the same configuration file.</p>
<p>
The input file to read a request from, or standard input if not
specified. A request is only read if the creation options</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
are not specified.</p>
<p>
The input format.</p>
<p>
The file to read the private key from. It also accepts PKCS#8 format
private keys for PEM format files.</p>
<p>
The format of the private key file specified in the</p>
<p>
argument. The default is</p>
<p>
The file to write the newly created private key to. If this option is
not specified, the filename present in the configuration file is used.</p>
<p>
The message digest to sign the request with. This overrides the digest
algorithm specified in the configuration file.</p>
<p>
Some public key algorithms may override this choice. For instance, DSA
signatures always use SHA1.</p>
<p>
Print the value of the modulus of the public key contained in the
request.</p>
<p>
This option causes the</p>
<p>
argument to be interpreted with full support for multivalued RDNs, for
example</p>
<p>
If</p>
<p>
is not used, the UID value is set to</p>
<p>
Determine how the subject or issuer names are displayed.</p>
<p>
can be a single option or multiple options separated by commas.
Alternatively, these options may be used more than once to set multiple
options. See the</p>
<p>
section below for details.</p>
<p>
Generate a new certificate request. The user is prompted for the
relevant field values. The actual fields prompted for and their maximum
and minimum sizes are specified in the configuration file and any
requested extensions.</p>
<p>
If the</p>
<p>
option is not used, it will generate a new RSA private key using
information specified in the configuration file.</p>
<p>
Add the word NEW to the PEM file header and footer lines on the
outputted request. Some software and CAs need this.</p>
<p>
Create a new certificate request and a new private key. The argument
takes one of several forms.</p>
<p>
generates an RSA key</p>
<p>
in size. If</p>
<p>
is omitted, the default key size is used.</p>
<p>
generates a DSA key using the parameters in</p>
<p>
generates a key using the parameters or certificate in</p>
<p>
All other algorithms support the form</p>
<p>
where file may be an algorithm parameter file, created by the</p>
<p>
command or an X.509 certificate for a key with appropriate algorithm.</p>
<p>
can be omitted, in which case any parameters can be specified via the</p>
<p>
option.</p>
<p>
Do not encrypt the private key.</p>
<p>
Do not output the encoded version of the request.</p>
<p>
The output file to write to, or standard output if not specified.</p>

<p>
Output the public key.</p>
<p>
Customise the output format used with</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
argument can be a single option or multiple options separated by commas.

<p>
Serial number to use when outputting a self-signed certificate. This may
be specified as a decimal value or a hex value if preceded by</p>
<p>
It is possible to use negative serial numbers but this is not
recommended.</p>
<p>
Pass options to the signature algorithm during sign operation. The names
and values of these options are algorithm-specific.</p>
<p>
Replaces the subject field of an input request with the specified data
and output the modified request.</p>
<p>
must be formatted as /type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=…; characters
may be escaped by</p>
<p>
(backslash); no spaces are skipped.</p>
<p>
Print the request subject (or certificate subject if</p>
<p>
is specified).</p>
<p>
Print the certificate request in plain text.</p>
<p>
Interpret field values as UTF8 strings, not ASCII.</p>
<p>
Print extra details about the operations being performed.</p>
<p>
Verify the signature on the request.</p>
<p>
Output a self-signed certificate instead of a certificate request. This
is typically used to generate a test certificate or a self-signed root
CA. The extensions added to the certificate (if any) are specified in
the configuration file. Unless specified using the</p>
<p>
option, 0 is used for the serial number.</p>
<p>
The configuration options are specified in the</p>
<p>
section of the configuration file. The options available are as follows:</p>
<p>
The section containing any request attributes: its format is the same as</p>
<p>
Typically these may contain the challengePassword or unstructuredName
types. They are currently ignored by the</p>
<p>
request signing utilities, but some CAs might want them.</p>
<p>
The default key size, in bits. The default is 2048. It is used if the</p>
<p>
option is used and can be overridden by using the</p>
<p>
option.</p>
<p>
The default file to write a private key to, or standard output if not
specified. It can be overridden by the</p>
<p>
option.</p>
<p>
The digest algorithm to use. Possible values include</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
(the default). It can be overridden on the command line.</p>
<p>
The section containing the distinguished name fields to prompt for when
generating a certificate or certificate request. The format is described
below.</p>
<p>
If set to</p>
<p>
and a private key is generated, it is not encrypted. It is equivalent to
the</p>
<p>
option. For compatibility,</p>
<p>
is an equivalent option.</p>
<p>
The passwords for the input private key file (if present) and the output
private key file (if one will be created). The command line options</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
override the configuration file values.</p>
<p>
A file containing additional OBJECT IDENTIFIERS. Each line of the file
should consist of the numerical form of the object identifier, followed
by whitespace, then the short name followed by whitespace and finally
the long name.</p>
<p>
Specify a section in the configuration file containing extra object
identifiers. Each line should consist of the short name of the object
identifier followed by</p>
<p>
and the numerical form. The short and long names are the same when this
option is used.</p>
<p>
If set to</p>
<p>
it disables prompting of certificate fields and just takes values from
the config file directly. It also changes the expected format of the</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
sections.</p>
<p>
The configuration file section containing a list of extensions to add to
the certificate request. It can be overridden by the</p>
<p>
option.</p>
<p>
Limit the string types for encoding certain fields. The following values
may be used, limiting strings to the indicated types:</p>
<p>
UTF8String. This is the default, as recommended by PKIX in RFC 2459.</p>
<p>
PrintableString, IA5String, T61String, BMPString, UTF8String.</p>
<p>
PrintableString, IA5String, BMPString, UTF8String. Inspired by the PKIX
recommendation in RFC 2459 for certificates generated before 2004, but
differs by also permitting IA5String.</p>
<p>
PrintableString, IA5String, T61String, UniversalString. A workaround for
some ancient software that had problems with the variable-sized
BMPString and UTF8String types.</p>
<p>
An explicit bitmask of permitted types, where</p>
<p>
is a C-style hex, decimal, or octal number that&#39;s a bit-wise OR of</p>
<p>
values from</p>
<p>
If set to</p>
<p>
field values are interpreted as UTF8 strings.</p>
<p>
The configuration file section containing a list of extensions to add to
a certificate generated when the</p>
<p>
switch is used. It can be overridden by the</p>
<p>
command line switch.</p>
<p>
There are two separate formats for the distinguished name and attribute
sections. If the</p>
<p>
option is set to</p>
<p>
then these sections just consist of field names and values. If the</p>
<p>
option is absent or not set to</p>
<p>
then the file contains field prompting information of the form:</p>
<p>
fieldName=&#34;prompt&#34; fieldName_default=&#34;default field value&#34;
fieldName_min= 2 fieldName_max= 4</p>
<p>
is the field name being used, for example</p>
<p>
(or CN). The</p>
<p>
string is used to ask the user to enter the relevant details. If the
user enters nothing, the default value is used; if no default value is
present, the field is omitted. A field can still be omitted if a default
value is present, if the user just enters the</p>
<p>
character.</p>
<p>
The number of characters entered must be between the fieldName_min and
fieldName_max limits: there may be additional restrictions based on the
field being used (for example</p>
<p>
can only ever be two characters long and must fit in a</p>
<p>
Some fields (such as</p>
<p>
can be used more than once in a DN. This presents a problem because
configuration files will not recognize the same name occurring twice. To
avoid this problem, if the</p>
<p>
contains some characters followed by a full stop, they will be ignored.
So, for example, a second</p>
<p>
can be input by calling it</p>
<p>
The actual permitted field names are any object identifier short or long
names. These are compiled into</p>

compatible format for private key encryption: newer applications should
use the more secure PKCS#8 format using the</p>
<p>
utility.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
Encrypt the private key with the AES, DES, or the triple DES ciphers,
respectively, before outputting it. A pass phrase is prompted for. If
none of these options are specified, the key is written in plain text.
This means that using the</p>
<p>
utility to read in an encrypted key with no encryption option can be
used to remove the pass phrase from a key, or by setting the encryption
options it can be used to add or change the pass phrase. These options
can only be used with PEM format output files.</p>

<p>
The private key format. The default is</p>
<p>
The padding to use: PKCS#1 OAEP, PKCS#1 v1.5 (the default), no padding,
or ANSI X9.31, respectively. For signatures, only</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
can be used.</p>

The output file to write to, or standard output if not specified.</p>
<p>
The key password source.</p>
<p>
The input file is an RSA public key.</p>
<p>
Reverse the order of the input buffer.</p>

<p>
Print session information when the program exits. This will always
attempt to print out information even if the connection fails. Normally,
information will only be printed out once if the connection succeeds.
This option is useful because the cipher in use may be renegotiated or
the connection may fail because a client certificate is required or is
requested only after an attempt is made to access a certain URL. Note
that the output produced by this option is not always accurate because a
connection might never have been established.</p>
<p>
Use the HTTP proxy at</p>
<p>

argument is given to the proxy. If not specified, localhost is used as
final destination. After that, switch the connection through the proxy
to the destination to TLS.</p>
<p>
Inhibit printing of session and certificate information. This implicitly
turns on</p>

as well.</p>
<p>
Reconnect to the same server 5 times using the same session ID; this can
be used as a test that session caching is working.</p>

Modify the cipher list used by the server. This allows the cipher list
used by the server to be modified. When the client sends a list of
supported ciphers, the first client cipher also included in the server
list is used. Because the client specifies the preference order, the
order of the server cipherlist is irrelevant. See the</p>
<p>
command for more information.</p>
<p>
Set the SSL context ID. It can be given any string value.</p>

Specify an additional certificate and private key; these behave in the
same manner as the</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
options except there is no default if they are not specified (no
additional certificate or key is used). By using RSA and DSS
certificates and keys, a server can support clients which only support

If neither</p>
<p>
nor</p>
<p>
are specified, they are both on by default and executed in sequence.</p>

The default is 30 seconds.</p>
<p>
Turn on server certificate verification, with a maximum length of</p>
<p>
Currently the verify operation continues after errors, so all the
problems with a certificate chain can be seen. As a side effect, the
connection will never fail due to a server certificate verify failure.</p>
<p>
The page to GET from the server. A value of</p>
<p>
gets the index.htm[l] page. If this parameter is not specified,</p>

transfer any payload data.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
program processes the encoded version of the SSL session structure and
optionally prints out SSL session details (for example the SSL session
master key) in human-readable format.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
If a certificate is present in the session, it will be output using this
option; if the</p>
<p>
option is also present, then it will be printed out in text form.</p>
<p>
Set the session</p>
<p>
The ID can be any string of characters.</p>
<p>
The input file to read from, or standard input if not specified.</p>
<p>
The input format.</p>
<p>
uses an ASN.1 DER-encoded format containing session details. The precise
format can vary from one version to the next.</p>
<p>
is the default format: it consists of the DER format base64-encoded with
additional header and footer lines.</p>
<p>
Do not output the encoded version of the session.</p>
<p>
The output file to write to, or standard output if not specified.</p>
<p>
The output format.</p>
<p>
Print the various public or private key components in plain text, in
addition to the encoded version.</p>
<p>
The output of</p>
<p>
is composed as follows:</p>
<p>
The protocol in use.</p>
<p>
The actual raw SSL or TLS cipher code.</p>
<p>
The SSL session ID, in hex format.</p>
<p>
The session ID context, in hex format.</p>
<p>
The SSL session master key.</p>
<p>
The key argument; this is only used in SSL v2.</p>
<p>
The session start time.</p>
<p>
format.</p>
<p>
The timeout, in seconds.</p>
<p>
The return code when a certificate is verified.</p>
<p>
Since the SSL session output contains the master key, it is possible to
read the contents of an encrypted session using this information.
Therefore appropriate security precautions should be taken if the
information is being output by a</p>
<p>
application. This is, however, strongly discouraged and should only be
used for debugging purposes.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command handles S/MIME mail. It can encrypt, decrypt, sign, and verify
S/MIME messages.</p>
<p>
The MIME message must be sent without any blank lines between the
headers and the output. Some mail programs will automatically add a
blank line. Piping the mail directly to an MTA is one way to achieve the
correct format.</p>
<p>
The supplied message to be signed or encrypted must include the
necessary MIME headers or many S/MIME clients won&#39;t display it properly
(if at all). Use the</p>
<p>
option to automatically add plain text headers.</p>
<p>
A</p>
<p>
message is one where a signed message is then encrypted. This can be
produced by encrypting an already signed message.</p>
<p>
There are a number of operations that can be performed, as follows:</p>
<p>
Decrypt mail using the supplied certificate and private key. The input
file is an encrypted mail message in MIME format. The decrypted mail is
written to the output file.</p>
<p>
Encrypt mail for the given recipient certificates. The input is the
message to be encrypted. The output file is the encrypted mail, in MIME
format.</p>
<p>
Take an input message and write out a PEM-encoded PKCS#7 structure.</p>
<p>
Resign a message: take an existing message and one or more new signers.</p>
<p>
Sign mail using the supplied certificate and private key. The input file
is the message to be signed. The signed message, in MIME format, is
written to the output file.</p>
<p>
Verify signed mail. The input is a signed mail message and the output is
the signed data. Both clear text and opaque signing is supported.</p>
<p>
The remaining options are as follows:</p>
<p>
The encryption algorithm to use. 128-, 192-, or 256-bit AES, DES (56
bits), triple DES (168 bits), or 40-, 64-, or 128-bit RC2, respectively;
if not specified, 40-bit RC2 is used. Only used with</p>
<p>
Normally, the input message is converted to</p>
<p>
format which uses CR/LF as end of line, as required by the S/MIME
specification. When this option is present, no translation occurs. This
is useful when handling binary data which may not be in MIME format.</p>
<p>
A</p>
<p>
containing trusted CA certificates; only used with</p>
<p>
A</p>
<p>

<p>
This directory must be a standard certificate directory: that is, a hash
of each subject name (using</p>
<p>
should be linked to each certificate.</p>
<p>
One or more certificates of message recipients: used when encrypting a
message.</p>
<p>
Allows additional certificates to be specified. When signing, these will
be included with the message. When verifying, these will be searched for
the signers&#39; certificates. The certificates should be in PEM format.</p>
<p>
Set various certificate chain validation options. See the</p>
<p>
command for details.</p>
<p>
A file containing the detached content. This is only useful with the</p>
<p>
option, and only usable if the PKCS#7 structure is using the detached
signature form where the content is not included. This option will
override any content if the input format is S/MIME and it uses the
multipart/signed MIME content type.</p>
<p>
The relevant mail headers. These are included outside the signed portion
of a message so they may be included manually. When signing, many S/MIME
mail clients check that the signer&#39;s certificate email address matches
the From: address.</p>
<p>
The input file to read from.</p>
<p>
Enable streaming I/O for encoding operations. This permits single pass
processing of data without the need to hold the entire contents in
memory, potentially supporting very large files. Streaming is
automatically set for S/MIME signing with detached data if the output
format is SMIME; it is currently off by default for all other
operations.</p>
<p>
The input format.</p>
<p>
The private key to use when signing or decrypting, which must match the
corresponding certificate. If this option is not specified, the private
key must be included in the certificate file specified with the</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
file. When signing, this option can be used multiple times to specify
successive keys.</p>
<p>
Input private key format. The default is</p>
<p>
The digest algorithm to use when signing or resigning. If not present
then the default digest algorithm for the signing key is used (usually
SHA1).</p>
<p>
Do not include attributes.</p>
<p>
Do not include the signer&#39;s certificate. This will reduce the size of
the signed message but the verifier must have a copy of the signer&#39;s
certificate available locally (passed using the</p>
<p>
option, for example).</p>
<p>
Do not do chain verification of signers&#39; certificates: that is, don&#39;t
use the certificates in the signed message as untrusted CAs.</p>
<p>
When signing a message, use opaque signing: this form is more resistant
to translation by mail relays but it cannot be read by mail agents that
do not support S/MIME. Without this option cleartext signing with the
MIME type multipart/signed is used.</p>
<p>
Disable streaming I/O where it would produce an encoding of indefinite
length (currently has no effect).</p>
<p>
Only use certificates specified in the</p>
<p>
The supplied certificates can still be used as untrusted CAs.</p>
<p>
Do not try to verify the signatures on the message.</p>
<p>
Exclude the list of supported algorithms from signed attributes, other
options such as signing time and content type are still included.</p>
<p>
Do not verify the signer&#39;s certificate of a signed message.</p>
<p>
The output file to write to.</p>
<p>
The output format. The default is smime, which writes an S/MIME format
message.</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
change this to write PEM and DER format PKCS#7 structures instead. This
currently only affects the output format of the PKCS#7 structure; if no
PKCS#7 structure is being output (for example with</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
this option has no effect.</p>
<p>
The key password source.</p>
<p>
The recipients certificate when decrypting a message. This certificate
must match one of the recipients of the message or an error occurs.</p>
<p>
A signing certificate when signing or resigning a message; this option
can be used multiple times if more than one signer is required. If a
message is being verified, the signer&#39;s certificates will be written to
this file if the verification was successful.</p>
<p>
The same as</p>
<p>
Add plain text (text/plain) MIME headers to the supplied message if
encrypting or signing. If decrypting or verifying, it strips off text
headers: if the decrypted or verified message is not of MIME type
text/plain then an error occurs.</p>
<p>
The exit codes for</p>
<p>
are as follows:</p>
<p>
The operation was completely successful.</p>
<p>
An error occurred parsing the command options.</p>
<p>
One of the input files could not be read.</p>
<p>
An error occurred creating the file or when reading the message.</p>
<p>
An error occurred decrypting or verifying the message.</p>
<p>
An error occurred writing certificates.</p>

The</p>
<p>
command is used to test the performance of cryptographic algorithms.</p>

<p>
The</p>
<p>
command is a basic Time Stamping Authority (TSA) client and server
application as specified in RFC 3161 (Time-Stamp Protocol, TSP). A TSA
can be part of a PKI deployment and its role is to provide long term
proof of the existence of specific data. Here is a brief description of
the protocol:</p>
<p>
The TSA client computes a one-way hash value for a data file and sends
the hash to the TSA.</p>
<p>
The TSA attaches the current date and time to the received hash value,
signs them and sends the time stamp token back to the client. By
creating this token the TSA certifies the existence of the original data
file at the time of response generation.</p>
<p>
The TSA client receives the time stamp token and verifies the signature
on it. It also checks if the token contains the same hash value that it
had sent to the TSA.</p>
<p>
There is one DER-encoded protocol data unit defined for transporting a
time stamp request to the TSA and one for sending the time stamp
response back to the client. The</p>
<p>
command has three main functions: creating a time stamp request based on
a data file; creating a time stamp response based on a request; and
verifying if a response corresponds to a particular request or a data
file.</p>
<p>
There is no support for sending the requests/responses automatically
over HTTP or TCP yet as suggested in RFC 3161. Users must send the
requests either by FTP or email.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
switch can be used for creating and printing a time stamp request with
the following options:</p>
<p>
Expect the TSA to include its signing certificate in the response.</p>
<p>
Specify an alternative configuration file. Only the OID section is used.</p>
<p>
The data file for which the time stamp request needs to be created. The
default is standard input.</p>
<p>
Specify the message imprint explicitly without the data file. The
imprint must be specified in a hexadecimal format, two characters per
byte, the bytes optionally separated by colons. The number of bytes must
match the message digest algorithm in use.</p>
<p>
A previously created time stamp request in DER format that will be
printed into the output file. Useful for examining the content of a
request in human-readable format.</p>
<p>
The message digest to apply to the data file. It supports all the
message digest algorithms that are supported by the</p>
<p>
command. The default is SHA1.</p>
<p>
Specify no nonce in the request. The default, to include a 64-bit long
pseudo-random nonce, is recommended to protect against replay attacks.</p>
<p>
The output file to write to, or standard output if not specified.</p>
<p>
The policy that the client expects the TSA to use for creating the time
stamp token. Either dotted OID notation or OID names defined in the
config file can be used. If no policy is requested, the TSA uses its own
default policy.</p>
<p>
Output in human-readable text format instead of DER.</p>
<p>
A time stamp response (TimeStampResp) consists of a response status and
the time stamp token itself (ContentInfo), if the token generation was
successful. The</p>
<p>
command is for creating a time stamp response or time stamp token based
on a request and printing the response/token in human-readable format.
If</p>
<p>
is not specified the output is always a time stamp response
(TimeStampResp), otherwise it is a time stamp token (ContentInfo).</p>
<p>
The collection of PEM certificates that will be included in the response
in addition to the signer certificate if the</p>
<p>
option was used for the request. This file is supposed to contain the
certificate chain for the signer certificate from its issuer upwards.
The</p>
<p>
command does not build a certificate chain automatically.</p>
<p>
Specify an alternative configuration file.</p>
<p>
Specify a previously created time stamp response (or time stamp token,
if</p>
<p>
is also specified) in DER format that will be written to the output
file. This option does not require a request; it is useful, for example,
to examine the content of a response or token or to extract the time
stamp token from a response. If the input is a token and the output is a
time stamp response, a default</p>
<p>
status info is added to the token.</p>
<p>
The signer private key of the TSA in PEM format. Overrides the</p>
<p>
config file option.</p>
<p>
The response is written to this file. The format and content of the file
depends on other options (see</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
The default is stdout.</p>
<p>
The key password source.</p>
<p>
The default policy to use for the response. Either dotted OID notation
or OID names defined in the config file can be used. If no policy is
requested, the TSA uses its own default policy.</p>
<p>
The file containing a DER-encoded time stamp request.</p>
<p>
The config file section containing the settings for response generation.</p>
<p>
The PEM signer certificate of the TSA. The TSA signing certificate must
have exactly one extended key usage assigned to it: timeStamping. The
extended key usage must also be critical, otherwise the certificate is
going to be refused. Overrides the</p>
<p>
variable of the config file.</p>
<p>
Output in human-readable text format instead of DER.</p>
<p>
The input is a DER-encoded time stamp token (ContentInfo) instead of a
time stamp response (TimeStampResp).</p>
<p>
The output is a time stamp token (ContentInfo) instead of a time stamp
response (TimeStampResp).</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command is for verifying if a time stamp response or time stamp token is
valid and matches a particular time stamp request or data file. The</p>
<p>
command does not use the configuration file.</p>
<p>
The file containing a set of trusted self-signed PEM CA certificates.
See</p>
<p>
for additional details. Either this option or</p>
<p>
must be specified.</p>
<p>
The directory containing the trusted CA certificates of the client. See</p>
<p>
for additional details. Either this option or</p>
<p>
must be specified.</p>
<p>
The response or token must be verified against</p>
<p>
The file is hashed with the message digest algorithm specified in the
token. The</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
options must not be specified with this one.</p>
<p>
The response or token must be verified against the message digest
specified with this option. The number of bytes must match the message
digest algorithm specified in the token. The</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
options must not be specified with this one.</p>
<p>
The time stamp response that needs to be verified, in DER format. This
option in mandatory.</p>
<p>
The original time stamp request, in DER format. The</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
options must not be specified with this one.</p>
<p>
The input is a DER-encoded time stamp token (ContentInfo) instead of a
time stamp response (TimeStampResp).</p>
<p>
Additional untrusted PEM certificates which may be needed when building
the certificate chain for the TSA&#39;s signing certificate. This file must
contain the TSA signing certificate and all intermediate CA certificates
unless the response includes them.</p>
<p>
Options specified on the command line always override the settings in
the config file:</p>
<p>
This is the main section and it specifies the name of another section
that contains all the options for the</p>
<p>
option. This section can be overridden with the</p>
<p>
command line switch.</p>
<p>
See</p>
<p>
for a description.</p>
<p>
See</p>
<p>
for a description.</p>
<p>
The file containing the hexadecimal serial number of the last time stamp
response created. This number is incremented by 1 for each response. If
the file does not exist at the time of response generation, a new file
is created with serial number 1. This parameter is mandatory.</p>
<p>
TSA signing certificate, in PEM format. The same as the</p>
<p>
command line option.</p>
<p>
A set of PEM-encoded certificates that need to be included in the
response. The same as the</p>
<p>
command line option.</p>
<p>
The private key of the TSA, in PEM format. The same as the</p>
<p>
command line option.</p>
<p>
The default policy to use when the request does not mandate any policy.
The same as the</p>
<p>
command line option.</p>
<p>
Comma separated list of policies that are also acceptable by the TSA and
used only if the request explicitly specifies one of them.</p>
<p>
The list of message digest algorithms that the TSA accepts. At least one
algorithm must be specified. This parameter is mandatory.</p>
<p>
The accuracy of the time source of the TSA in seconds, milliseconds and
microseconds. For example, secs:1, millisecs:500, microsecs:100. If any
of the components is missing, zero is assumed for that field.</p>
<p>
The maximum number of digits, which represent the fraction of seconds,
that need to be included in the time field. The trailing zeroes must be
removed from the time, so there might actually be fewer digits or no
fraction of seconds at all. The maximum value is 6; the default is 0.</p>
<p>
If this option is yes, the responses generated by this TSA can always be
ordered, even if the time difference between two responses is less than
the sum of their accuracies. The default is no.</p>
<p>
Set this option to yes if the subject name of the TSA must be included
in the TSA name field of the response. The default is no.</p>
<p>
The SignedData objects created by the TSA always contain the certificate
identifier of the signing certificate in a signed attribute (see RFC
2634, Enhanced Security Services). If this option is set to yes and
either the</p>
<p>
variable or the</p>
<p>
option is specified then the certificate identifiers of the chain will
also be included in the SigningCertificate signed attribute. If this
variable is set to no, only the signing certificate identifier is
included. The default is no.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
command verifies certificate chains.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
A</p>
<p>
of trusted certificates. The</p>
<p>
should contain multiple certificates in PEM format, concatenated
together.</p>
<p>
A</p>
<p>
of trusted certificates. The certificates, or symbolic links to them,
should have names of the form</p>
<p>
where</p>
<p>
is the hashed certificate subject name (see the</p>
<p>
option of the</p>
<p>
utility).</p>
<p>
Verify the signature on the self-signed root CA. This is disabled by
default because it doesn&#39;t add any security.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
should contain one or more CRLs in PEM format.</p>
<p>
Check end entity certificate validity by attempting to look up a valid
CRL. If a valid CRL cannot be found, an error occurs.</p>
<p>
Check the validity of all certificates in the chain by attempting to
look up valid CRLs.</p>
<p>
Set policy variable require-explicit-policy (RFC 3280).</p>
<p>
Enable extended CRL features such as indirect CRLs and alternate CRL
signing keys.</p>
<p>
Print a usage message.</p>
<p>
Ignore critical extensions instead of rejecting the certificate.</p>
<p>
Set policy variable inhibit-any-policy (RFC 3280).</p>
<p>
Set policy variable inhibit-policy-mapping (RFC 3280).</p>
<p>
Print diagnostics relating to searches for the issuer certificate of the
current certificate showing why each candidate issuer certificate was
rejected. The presence of rejection messages does not itself imply that
anything is wrong: during the normal verify process several rejections
may take place.</p>
<p>
Use the legacy X.509 certificate chain verification code.</p>
<p>
Enable certificate policy processing.</p>
<p>
The intended use for the certificate. Without this option no chain
verification will be done. Currently accepted uses are</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
A</p>
<p>
of trusted certificates. The</p>
<p>
should contain multiple certificates.</p>
<p>
A</p>
<p>
of untrusted certificates. The</p>
<p>
should contain multiple certificates.</p>
<p>
Print extra information about the operations being performed.</p>
<p>
Disable workarounds for broken certificates which have to be disabled
for strict X.509 compliance.</p>
<p>
One or more PEM</p>
<p>
to verify. If no certificate files are included, an attempt is made to
read a certificate from standard input. If the first certificate
filename begins with a dash, use a lone dash to mark the last option.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
program uses the same functions as the internal SSL and S/MIME
verification, with one crucial difference: wherever possible an attempt
is made to continue after an error, whereas normally the verify
operation would halt on the first error. This allows all the problems
with a certificate chain to be determined.</p>
<p>
The verify operation consists of a number of separate steps. Firstly a
certificate chain is built up starting from the supplied certificate and
ending in the root CA. It is an error if the whole chain cannot be built
up. The chain is built up by looking up the issuer&#39;s certificate of the
current certificate. If a certificate is found which is its own issuer,
it is assumed to be the root CA.</p>
<p>
All certificates whose subject name matches the issuer name of the
current certificate are subject to further tests. The relevant authority
key identifier components of the current certificate (if present) must
match the subject key identifier (if present) and issuer and serial
number of the candidate issuer; in addition the</p>
<p>
extension of the candidate issuer (if present) must permit certificate
signing.</p>
<p>
The lookup first looks in the list of untrusted certificates and if no
match is found the remaining lookups are from the trusted certificates.
The root CA is always looked up in the trusted certificate list: if the
certificate to verify is a root certificate, then an exact match must be
found in the trusted list.</p>
<p>
The second operation is to check every untrusted certificate&#39;s
extensions for consistency with the supplied purpose. If the</p>
<p>
option is not included, then no checks are done. The supplied or</p>
<p>
certificate must have extensions compatible with the supplied purpose
and all other certificates must also be valid CA certificates. The
precise extensions required are described in more detail in the</p>
<p>
section below.</p>
<p>
The third operation is to check the trust settings on the root CA. The
root CA should be trusted for the supplied purpose. A certificate with
no trust settings is considered to be valid for all purposes.</p>
<p>
The final operation is to check the validity of the certificate chain.
The validity period is checked against the current system time and the</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
dates in the certificate. The certificate signatures are also checked at
this point.</p>
<p>
If all operations complete successfully, the certificate is considered
valid. If any operation fails then the certificate is not valid. When a
verify operation fails, the output messages can be somewhat cryptic. The
general form of the error message is:</p>
<p>
server.pem: /C=AU/ST=Queensland/O=CryptSoft Pty Ltd/CN=Test CA
(1024-bit) error 24 at 1 depth lookup:invalid CA certificate</p>
<p>
The first line contains the name of the certificate being verified,
followed by the subject name of the certificate. The second line
contains the error number as defined by the</p>
<p>
constants in</p>
<p>
the associated error message documented in</p>
<p>
and the depth. The depth is the number of the certificate being verified
when a problem was detected starting with zero for the certificate being
verified itself, then 1 for the CA that signed the certificate and so
on.</p>

Output the certificate in the form of a C source file.</p>
<p>
Customise the output format used with</p>
<p>
either using a list of comma-separated options or by specifying</p>
<p>
multiple times. The default behaviour is to print all fields. The
options are as follows:</p>
<p>
Equivalent to</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
Equivalent to no output options at all.</p>
<p>
Print unsupported certificate extensions.</p>
<p>
Hex dump unsupported extensions.</p>
<p>
Print an error message for unsupported certificate extensions.</p>
<p>
ASN.1 parse unsupported extensions.</p>
<p>
Do not print certificate trust information.</p>
<p>
Do not print X509V3 extensions.</p>
<p>
Do not print header (Certificate and Data) information.</p>
<p>
Do not print the issuer name.</p>
<p>
Do not print the public key.</p>
<p>
Do not print the serial number.</p>
<p>
Do not give a hexadecimal dump of the certificate signature.</p>
<p>
Do not print the signature algorithm used.</p>
<p>
Do not print the subject name.</p>
<p>
Do not print the</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
(validity) fields.</p>
<p>
Do not print the version number.</p>
<p>
Print the start and expiry date of a certificate.</p>
<p>
Output the email addresses, if any.</p>
<p>
Print the expiry date of the certificate; that is, the</p>
<p>
date.</p>
<p>
Print the digest of the DER-encoded version of the whole certificate.</p>
<p>
A synonym for</p>
<p>
Print the issuer name.</p>
<p>
Print the hash of the certificate issuer name.</p>
<p>
Print the hash of the certificate issuer name using the older algorithm
as used by</p>
<p>
versions before 1.0.0.</p>
<p>
Print the value of the modulus of the public key contained in the
certificate.</p>
<p>
This option causes the</p>
<p>
argument to be interpreted with full support for multivalued RDNs, for
example</p>
<p>
If</p>
<p>
is not used, the UID value is set to</p>
<p>
Customise how the subject or issuer names are displayed, either using a
list of comma-separated options or by specifying</p>
<p>
multiple times. The default behaviour is to use the</p>
<p>
format. The options, which can be preceded by a dash to turn them off,
are as follows:</p>
<p>
Align field values for a more readable output. Only usable with</p>
<p>
Use the old format, equivalent to specifying no options at all.</p>
<p>
Reverse the fields of the DN, as required by RFC 2253. As a side effect,
this also reverses the order of multiple AVAs.</p>
<p>
Dump all fields. When used with</p>
<p>
it allows the DER encoding of the structure to be unambiguously
determined.</p>
<p>
Any fields that need to be hexdumped are dumped using the DER encoding
of the field. Otherwise just the content octets will be displayed. Both
options use the RFC 2253 #XXXX… format.</p>
<p>
Dump non-character string types (for example OCTET STRING); usually,
non-character string types are displayed as though each content octet
represents a single character.</p>
<p>
Dump any field whose OID is not recognised by</p>
<p>
Escape the</p>
<p>
characters required by RFC 2253 in a field that is</p>
<p>
Additionally,</p>
<p>
is escaped at the beginning of a string and a space character at the
beginning or end of a string.</p>
<p>
Escape control characters. That is, those with ASCII values less than
0x20 (space) and the delete (0x7f) character. They are escaped using the
RFC 2253 \XX notation (where XX are two hex digits representing the
character value).</p>
<p>
Escape characters with the MSB set; that is, with ASCII values larger
than 127.</p>
<p>
A multiline format. Equivalent to</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
Do not attempt to interpret multibyte characters. That is, content
octets are merely dumped as though one octet represents each character.
This is useful for diagnostic purposes but results in rather odd looking
output.</p>
<p>
Alter how the field name is displayed:</p>
<p>
does not display the field at all;</p>
<p>
uses the short name form (CN for</p>
<p>
for example);</p>
<p>
uses the long form.</p>
<p>
represents the OID in numerical form and is useful for diagnostic
purpose.</p>
<p>
A one line format which is more readable than</p>
<p>
Equivalent to</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
Displays names compatible with RFC 2253. Equivalent to</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
Determine the field separators: the first character is between RDNs and
the second between multiple AVAs (multiple AVAs are very rare and their
use is discouraged). The options ending in</p>
<p>
additionally place a space after the separator to make it more readable.</p>
<p>
uses a linefeed character for the RDN separator and a spaced</p>
<p>
for the AVA separator, as well as indenting the fields by four
characters. If no field separator is specified then</p>
<p>
is used by default.</p>
<p>
Show the type of the ASN.1 character string. The type precedes the field
contents. For example</p>
<p>
Place spaces round the</p>
<p>
character which follows the field name.</p>
<p>
Escape some characters by surrounding the whole string with</p>
<p>
characters. Without the option, all escaping is done with the</p>
<p>
character.</p>
<p>
Convert all strings to UTF8 format first, as required by RFC 2253. On a
UTF8 compatible terminal, the use of this option (and not setting</p>
<p>
may result in the correct display of multibyte characters. Usually,
multibyte characters larger than 0xff are represented using the format
\UXXXX for 16 bits and \WXXXXXXXX for 32 bits, and any UTF8Strings are
converted to their character form first.</p>
<p>
Print the next serial number.</p>
<p>
Do not output the encoded version of the request.</p>
<p>
Print the OCSP responder addresses, if any.</p>
<p>
Print OCSP hash values for the subject name and public key.</p>
<p>
Print the public key.</p>
<p>
Print the certificate serial number.</p>
<p>
Pass options to the signature algorithm during sign or certify
operations. The names and values of these options are
algorithm-specific.</p>
<p>
Print the start date of the certificate; that is, the</p>
<p>
date.</p>
<p>
Print the subject name.</p>
<p>
Print the hash of the certificate subject name. This is used in</p>
<p>
to form an index to allow certificates in a directory to be looked up by
subject name.</p>
<p>
Print the hash of the certificate subject name using the older algorithm
as used by</p>
<p>
versions before 1.0.0.</p>
<p>
Print the full certificate in text form.</p>
<p>
A trusted certificate is a certificate which has several additional
pieces of information attached to it such as the permitted and
prohibited uses of the certificate and an alias. When a certificate is
being verified, at least one certificate must be trusted. By default, a
trusted certificate must be stored locally and be a root CA. The
following are x509 trust settings options:</p>
<p>
Add a prohibited use. Accepts the same values as the</p>
<p>
option.</p>
<p>
Add a trusted certificate use. Any object name can be used here, but
currently only</p>
<p>
(SSL client use),</p>
<p>
(SSL server use), and</p>
<p>
(S/MIME email) are used.</p>
<p>
Output the certificate alias.</p>
<p>
Clear all the prohibited or rejected uses of the certificate.</p>
<p>
Clear all the permitted or trusted uses of the certificate.</p>
<p>
Perform tests on the certificate extensions. The same code is used when
verifying untrusted certificates in chains, so this section is useful if
a chain is rejected by the verify code.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
extension CA flag is used to determine whether the certificate can be
used as a CA. If the CA flag is true, it is a CA; if the CA flag is
false, it is not a CA. All CAs should have the CA flag set to true.</p>
<p>
If the</p>
<p>
extension is absent, then the certificate is considered to be a possible
CA; other extensions are checked according to the intended use of the
certificate. A warning is given in this case because the certificate
should really not be regarded as a CA. However it is allowed to be a CA
to work around some broken software.</p>
<p>
If the certificate is a V1 certificate (and thus has no extensions) and
it is self-signed, it is also assumed to be a CA but a warning is again
given. This is to work around the problem of Verisign roots which are V1
self-signed certificates.</p>
<p>
If the</p>
<p>
extension is present, then additional restraints are made on the uses of
the certificate. A CA certificate must have the</p>
<p>
bit set if the</p>
<p>
extension is present.</p>
<p>
The extended key usage extension places additional restrictions on the
certificate uses. If this extension is present, whether critical or not,
the key can only be used for the purposes specified.</p>
<p>
A complete description of each test is given below. The comments about</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
and V1 certificates above apply to all CA certificates.</p>
<p>
The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the web
client authentication OID.</p>
<p>
must be absent or it must have the</p>
<p>
bit set. The Netscape certificate type must be absent or it must have
the SSL client bit set.</p>
<p>
The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the web
client authentication OID. The Netscape certificate type must be absent
or it must have the SSL CA bit set: this is used as a workaround if the</p>
<p>
extension is absent.</p>
<p>
The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the web
server authentication and/or one of the SGC OIDs.</p>
<p>
must be absent or it must have the</p>
<p>
set, the</p>
<p>
set, or both bits set. The Netscape certificate type must be absent or
have the SSL server bit set.</p>
<p>
The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the web
server authentication and/or one of the SGC OIDs. The Netscape
certificate type must be absent or the SSL CA bit must be set: this is
used as a workaround if the</p>
<p>
extension is absent.</p>
<p>
For Netscape SSL clients to connect to an SSL server; it must have the</p>
<p>
bit set if the</p>
<p>
extension is present. This isn&#39;t always valid because some cipher suites
use the key for digital signing. Otherwise it is the same as a normal
SSL server.</p>
<p>
The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the email
protection OID. The Netscape certificate type must be absent or should
have the S/MIME bit set. If the S/MIME bit is not set in Netscape
certificate type, then the SSL client bit is tolerated as an alternative
but a warning is shown: this is because some Verisign certificates don&#39;t
set the S/MIME bit.</p>
<p>
In addition to the common S/MIME client tests, the</p>
<p>
bit must be set if the</p>
<p>
extension is present.</p>
<p>
In addition to the common S/MIME tests, the</p>
<p>
bit must be set if the</p>
<p>
extension is present.</p>
<p>
The extended key usage extension must be absent or include the email
protection OID. The Netscape certificate type must be absent or must
have the S/MIME CA bit set: this is used as a workaround if the</p>
<p>
extension is absent.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
extension must be absent or it must have the CRL signing bit set.</p>
<p>
The normal CA tests apply, except the</p>
<p>
extension must be present.</p>
<p>
Set the alias of the certificate, allowing the certificate to be
referred to using a nickname, such as</p>
<p>
Output a trusted certificate (the default if any trust settings are
modified). An ordinary or trusted certificate can be input, but by
default an ordinary certificate is output and any trust settings are
discarded.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
utility can be used to sign certificates and requests: it can thus
behave like a mini CA. The following are x509 signing options:</p>
<p>
The CA certificate to be used for signing. When this option is present,</p>
<p>
behaves like a mini CA. The input file is signed by the CA using this
option; that is, its issuer name is set to the subject name of the CA
and it is digitally signed using the CA&#39;s private key.</p>
<p>
This option is normally combined with the</p>
<p>
option. Without the</p>
<p>
option, the input is a certificate which must be self-signed.</p>
<p>
Create the CA serial number file if it does not exist instead of
generating an error. The file will contain the serial number</p>
<p>
and the certificate being signed will have</p>
<p>
as its serial number.</p>
<p>
The format of the CA certificate file. The default is</p>
<p>
Set the CA private key to sign a certificate with. Otherwise it is
assumed that the CA private key is present in the CA certificate file.</p>
<p>
The format of the CA private key. The default is</p>
<p>
Use the serial number in</p>
<p>
to sign a certificate. The file should consist of one line containing an
even number of hex digits with the serial number to use. After each use
the serial number is incremented and written out to the file again.</p>
<p>
The default filename consists of the CA certificate file base name with</p>
<p>
appended. For example, if the CA certificate file is called</p>
<p>
it expects to find a serial number file called</p>
<p>
Check whether the certificate expires in the next</p>
<p>
seconds. If so, exit with return value 1; otherwise exit with return
value 0.</p>
<p>
Delete any extensions from a certificate. This option is used when a
certificate is being created from another certificate (for example with
the</p>
<p>
or the</p>
<p>
options). Normally, all extensions are retained.</p>
<p>
The number of days to make a certificate valid for. The default is 30
days.</p>
<p>
The section to add certificate extensions from. If this option is not
specified, the extensions should either be contained in the unnamed
(default) section or the default section should contain a variable
called</p>
<p>
which contains the section to use.</p>
<p>
File containing certificate extensions to use. If not specified, no
extensions are added to the certificate.</p>
<p>
Set the public key of the certificate to the public key contained in</p>
<p>
The format of the key file used in the</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
options.</p>
<p>
Generate a new certificate using the subject given by</p>
<p>
and signed by</p>
<p>
If no public key is provided with</p>
<p>
the resulting certificate is self-signed. This option cannot be used
with</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
Expect a certificate request on input instead of a certificate. This
option cannot be used with</p>
<p>
The issuer name to use.</p>
<p>
must be formatted as /type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=…; characters
may be escaped by</p>
<p>
(backslash); no spaces are skipped.</p>
<p>
The serial number to use. This option can be used with either the</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
options. If used in conjunction with the</p>
<p>
option, the serial number file (as specified by the</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
options) is not used.</p>
<p>
The serial number can be decimal or hex (if preceded by</p>
<p>
Negative serial numbers can also be specified but their use is not
recommended.</p>
<p>
The subject name to use.</p>
<p>
must be formatted as /type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=…; characters
may be escaped by</p>
<p>
(backslash); no spaces are skipped.</p>
<p>
Self-sign</p>
<p>
using the supplied private key.</p>
<p>
If the input file is a certificate, it sets the issuer name to the
subject name (i.e. makes it self-signed), changes the public key to the
supplied value, and changes the start and end dates. The start date is
set to the current time and the end date is set to a value determined by
the</p>
<p>
option. Any certificate extensions are retained unless the</p>
<p>
option is supplied.</p>
<p>
If the input is a certificate request, a self-signed certificate is
created using the supplied private key using the subject name in the
request.</p>
<p>
Interpret field values read from a terminal or obtained from a
configuration file as UTF-8 strings. By default, they are interpreted as
ASCII.</p>
<p>
Convert a certificate into a certificate request. The</p>
<p>
option is used to pass the required private key.</p>
<p>
Several commands share a common syntax, as detailed below.</p>
<p>
Password arguments, typically specified using</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
for input and output passwords, allow passwords to be obtained from a
variety of sources. Both of these options take a single argument,
described below. If no password argument is given and a password is
required, then the user is prompted to enter one: this will typically be
read from the current terminal with echoing turned off.</p>
<p>
The actual password is</p>
<p>
Since the password is visible to utilities, this form should only be
used where security is not important.</p>
<p>
Obtain the password from the environment variable</p>
<p>
Since the environment of other processes is visible, this option should
be used with caution.</p>
<p>
The first line of</p>
<p>
is the password. If the same</p>
<p>
argument is supplied to</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
then the first line will be used for the input password and the next
line for the output password.</p>
<p>
need not refer to a regular file: it could, for example, refer to a
device or named pipe.</p>
<p>
Read the password from the file descriptor</p>
<p>
This can be used to send the data via a pipe, for example.</p>
<p>
Read the password from standard input.</p>
<p>
Input/output formats, typically specified using</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
indicate the format being read from or written to. The argument is case
insensitive.</p>
<p>
Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) is a binary format.</p>
<p>
Insecure legacy format.</p>
<p>
Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) is base64-encoded.</p>
<p>
Private Key format.</p>
<p>
An SMIME format message.</p>
<p>
Plain ASCII text.</p>
<p>
The following environment variables affect the execution of</p>
<p>
The location of the master configuration file.</p>
