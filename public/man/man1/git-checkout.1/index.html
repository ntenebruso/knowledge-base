DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Updates files in the working tree to match the version in the index or
the specified tree. If no pathspec was given, <em>git checkout</em> will also
update <strong>HEAD</strong> to set the specified branch as the current branch.</p>
<p>
<em>git checkout</em> [&lt;branch&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To prepare for working on <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong>, switch to it by updating the index
and the files in the working tree, and by pointing <strong>HEAD</strong> at the branch.
Local modifications to the files in the working tree are kept, so that
they can be committed to the <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>
If <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong> is not found but there does exist a tracking branch in
exactly one remote (call it <strong>&lt;remote&gt;</strong>) with a matching name and
<strong>–no-guess</strong> is not specified, treat as equivalent to</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git checkout -b &lt;branch&gt; --track &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
You could omit <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong>, in which case the command degenerates to
&#34;check out the current branch&#34;, which is a glorified no-op with rather
expensive side-effects to show only the tracking information, if it
exists, for the current branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>git checkout</em> -b|-B &lt;new-branch&gt; [&lt;start-point&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifying <strong>-b</strong> causes a new branch to be created as if <strong>git-branch*(1)
were called and then checked out. In this case you can use the *–track</strong>
or <strong>–no-track</strong> options, which will be passed to <em>git branch</em>. As a
convenience, <strong>–track</strong> without <strong>-b</strong> implies branch creation; see the
description of <strong>–track</strong> below.</p>
<p>
If <strong>-B</strong> is given, <strong>&lt;new-branch&gt;</strong> is created if it doesn&#39;t exist;
otherwise, it is reset. This is the transactional equivalent of</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git branch -f &lt;branch&gt; [&lt;start-point&gt;]
$ git checkout &lt;branch&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
that is to say, the branch is not reset/created unless &#34;git checkout&#34; is
successful (e.g., when the branch is in use in another worktree, not
just the current branch stays the same, but the branch is not reset to
the start-point, either).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>git checkout</em> –detach [&lt;branch&gt;], <em>git checkout</em> [–detach] &lt;commit&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prepare to work on top of <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong>, by detaching <strong>HEAD</strong> at it (see
&#34;DETACHED HEAD&#34; section), and updating the index and the files in the
working tree. Local modifications to the files in the working tree are
kept, so that the resulting working tree will be the state recorded in
the commit plus the local modifications.</p>
<p>
When the <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong> argument is a branch name, the <strong>–detach</strong> option can
be used to detach <strong>HEAD</strong> at the tip of the branch (<strong>git checkout
&lt;branch&gt;</strong> would check out that branch without detaching <strong>HEAD</strong>).</p>
<p>
Omitting <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong> detaches <strong>HEAD</strong> at the tip of the current branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>git checkout</em> [-f|–ours|–theirs|-m|–conflict=&lt;style&gt;] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;]
[–] &lt;pathspec&gt;…, <em>git checkout</em>
[-f|–ours|–theirs|-m|–conflict=&lt;style&gt;] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;]
–pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt; [–pathspec-file-nul]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overwrite the contents of the files that match the pathspec. When the
<strong>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</strong> (most often a commit) is not given, overwrite working tree
with the contents in the index. When the <strong>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</strong> is given,
overwrite both the index and the working tree with the contents at the
<strong>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>
The index may contain unmerged entries because of a previous failed
merge. By default, if you try to check out such an entry from the index,
the checkout operation will fail and nothing will be checked out. Using
<strong>-f</strong> will ignore these unmerged entries. The contents from a specific
side of the merge can be checked out of the index by using <strong>–ours</strong> or
<strong>–theirs</strong>. With <strong>-m</strong>, changes made to the working tree file can be
discarded to re-create the original conflicted merge result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>git checkout</em> (-p|–patch) [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [–] [&lt;pathspec&gt;…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is similar to the previous mode, but lets you use the interactive
interface to show the &#34;diff&#34; output and choose which hunks to use in the
result. See below for the description of <strong>–patch</strong> option.</p>

<p>
–progress, –no-progress</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default when
it is attached to a terminal, unless <strong>–quiet</strong> is specified. This flag
enables progress reporting even if not attached to a terminal,
regardless of <strong>–quiet</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-f, –force</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When switching branches, proceed even if the index or the working tree
differs from <strong>HEAD</strong>, and even if there are untracked files in the way.
This is used to throw away local changes and any untracked files or
directories that are in the way.</p>
<p>
When checking out paths from the index, do not fail upon unmerged
entries; instead, unmerged entries are ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ours, –theirs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When checking out paths from the index, check out stage #2 (<em>ours</em>) or
​#3 (<em>theirs</em>) for unmerged paths.</p>
<p>
Note that during <strong>git rebase</strong> and <strong>git pull –rebase</strong>, <em>ours</em> and
<em>theirs</em> may appear swapped; <strong>–ours</strong> gives the version from the branch
the changes are rebased onto, while <strong>–theirs</strong> gives the version from
the branch that holds your work that is being rebased.</p>
<p>
This is because <strong>rebase</strong> is used in a workflow that treats the history
at the remote as the shared canonical one, and treats the work done on
the branch you are rebasing as the third-party work to be integrated,
and you are temporarily assuming the role of the keeper of the canonical
history during the rebase. As the keeper of the canonical history, you
need to view the history from the remote as <strong>ours</strong> (i.e. &#34;our shared
canonical history&#34;), while what you did on your side branch as <strong>theirs</strong>
(i.e. &#34;one contributor&#39;s work on top of it&#34;).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-b &lt;new-branch&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a new branch named <strong>&lt;new-branch&gt;</strong>, start it at <strong>&lt;start-point&gt;</strong>,
and check the resulting branch out; see *git-branch*(1) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-B &lt;new-branch&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creates the branch <strong>&lt;new-branch&gt;</strong>, start it at <strong>&lt;start-point&gt;</strong>; if it
already exists, then reset it to <strong>&lt;start-point&gt;</strong>. And then check the
resulting branch out. This is equivalent to running &#34;git branch&#34; with
&#34;-f&#34; followed by &#34;git checkout&#34; of that branch; see *git-branch*(1) for
details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-t, –track[=(direct|inherit)]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When creating a new branch, set up &#34;upstream&#34; configuration. See
&#34;–track&#34; in *git-branch*(1) for details.</p>
<p>
If no <strong>-b</strong> option is given, the name of the new branch will be derived
from the remote-tracking branch, by looking at the local part of the
refspec configured for the corresponding remote, and then stripping the
initial part up to the &#34;<strong>&#34;. This would tell us to use *hack</strong> as the
local branch when branching off of <strong>origin/hack</strong> (or
<strong>remotes/origin/hack</strong>, or even <strong>refs/remotes/origin/hack</strong>). If the given
name has no slash, or the above guessing results in an empty name, the
guessing is aborted. You can explicitly give a name with <strong>-b</strong> in such a
case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-track</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not set up &#34;upstream&#34; configuration, even if the
<strong>branch.autoSetupMerge</strong> configuration variable is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–guess, –no-guess</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong> is not found but there does exist a tracking branch in
exactly one remote (call it <strong>&lt;remote&gt;</strong>) with a matching name, treat as
equivalent to</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git checkout -b &lt;branch&gt; --track &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If the branch exists in multiple remotes and one of them is named by the
<strong>checkout.defaultRemote</strong> configuration variable, we&#39;ll use that one for
the purposes of disambiguation, even if the <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong> isn&#39;t unique
across all remotes. Set it to e.g. <strong>checkout.defaultRemote=origin</strong> to
always checkout remote branches from there if <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong> is ambiguous
but exists on the <em>origin</em> remote. See also <strong>checkout.defaultRemote</strong> in
*git-config*(1).</p>
<p>
<strong>–guess</strong> is the default behavior. Use <strong>–no-guess</strong> to disable it.</p>
<p>
The default behavior can be set via the <strong>checkout.guess</strong> configuration
variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-l</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create the new branch&#39;s reflog; see *git-branch*(1) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-d, –detach</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rather than checking out a branch to work on it, check out a commit for
inspection and discardable experiments. This is the default behavior of
<strong>git checkout &lt;commit&gt;</strong> when <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong> is not a branch name. See the
&#34;DETACHED HEAD&#34; section below for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–orphan &lt;new-branch&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a new unborn branch, named <strong>&lt;new-branch&gt;</strong>, started from
<strong>&lt;start-point&gt;</strong> and switch to it. The first commit made on this new
branch will have no parents and it will be the root of a new history
totally disconnected from all the other branches and commits.</p>
<p>
The index and the working tree are adjusted as if you had previously run
<strong>git checkout &lt;start-point&gt;</strong>. This allows you to start a new history
that records a set of paths similar to <strong>&lt;start-point&gt;</strong> by easily running
<strong>git commit -a</strong> to make the root commit.</p>
<p>
This can be useful when you want to publish the tree from a commit
without exposing its full history. You might want to do this to publish
an open source branch of a project whose current tree is &#34;clean&#34;, but
whose full history contains proprietary or otherwise encumbered bits of
code.</p>
<p>
If you want to start a disconnected history that records a set of paths
that is totally different from the one of <strong>&lt;start-point&gt;</strong>, then you
should clear the index and the working tree right after creating the
orphan branch by running <strong>git rm -rf .</strong> from the top level of the
working tree. Afterwards you will be ready to prepare your new files,
repopulating the working tree, by copying them from elsewhere,
extracting a tarball, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignore-skip-worktree-bits</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In sparse checkout mode, <strong>git checkout – &lt;paths&gt;</strong> would update only
entries matched by <strong>&lt;paths&gt;</strong> and sparse patterns in
<strong>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</strong>. This option ignores the sparse patterns
and adds back any files in <strong>&lt;paths&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-m, –merge</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When switching branches, if you have local modifications to one or more
files that are different between the current branch and the branch to
which you are switching, the command refuses to switch branches in order
to preserve your modifications in context. However, with this option, a
three-way merge between the current branch, your working tree contents,
and the new branch is done, and you will be on the new branch.</p>
<p>
When a merge conflict happens, the index entries for conflicting paths
are left unmerged, and you need to resolve the conflicts and mark the
resolved paths with <strong>git add</strong> (or <strong>git rm</strong> if the merge should result in
deletion of the path).</p>
<p>
When checking out paths from the index, this option lets you recreate
the conflicted merge in the specified paths. This option cannot be used
when checking out paths from a tree-ish.</p>
<p>
When switching branches with <strong>–merge</strong>, staged changes may be lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–conflict=&lt;style&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same as <strong>–merge</strong> option above, but changes the way the conflicting
hunks are presented, overriding the <strong>merge.conflictStyle</strong> configuration
variable. Possible values are &#34;merge&#34; (default), &#34;diff3&#34;, and &#34;zdiff3&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-p, –patch</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interactively select hunks in the difference between the <strong>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</strong>
(or the index, if unspecified) and the working tree. The chosen hunks
are then applied in reverse to the working tree (and if a <strong>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</strong>
was specified, the index).</p>
<p>
This means that you can use <strong>git checkout -p</strong> to selectively discard
edits from your current working tree. See the “Interactive Mode” section
of <strong>git-add*(1) to learn how to operate the *–patch</strong> mode.</p>
<p>
Note that this option uses the no overlay mode by default (see also
<strong>–overlay</strong>), and currently doesn&#39;t support overlay mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignore-other-worktrees</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>git checkout</strong> refuses when the wanted ref is already checked out by
another worktree. This option makes it check the ref out anyway. In
other words, the ref can be held by more than one worktree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–overwrite-ignore, –no-overwrite-ignore</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Silently overwrite ignored files when switching branches. This is the
default behavior. Use <strong>–no-overwrite-ignore</strong> to abort the operation
when the new branch contains ignored files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–recurse-submodules, –no-recurse-submodules</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using <strong>–recurse-submodules</strong> will update the content of all active
submodules according to the commit recorded in the superproject. If
local modifications in a submodule would be overwritten the checkout
will fail unless <strong>-f</strong> is used. If nothing (or <strong>–no-recurse-submodules</strong>)
is used, submodules working trees will not be updated. Just like
<strong>git-submodule*(1), this will detach *HEAD</strong> of the submodule.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–overlay, –no-overlay</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the default overlay mode, <strong>git checkout</strong> never removes files from the
index or the working tree. When specifying <strong>–no-overlay</strong>, files that
appear in the index and working tree, but not in <strong>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</strong> are
removed, to make them match <strong>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</strong> exactly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pathspec is passed in <strong>&lt;file&gt;</strong> instead of commandline args. If <strong>&lt;file&gt;</strong>
is exactly <strong>-</strong> then standard input is used. Pathspec elements are
separated by LF or CR/LF. Pathspec elements can be quoted as explained
for the configuration variable <strong>core.quotePath</strong> (see <strong>git-config*(1)).
See also *–pathspec-file-nul</strong> and global <strong>–literal-pathspecs</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–pathspec-file-nul</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only meaningful with <strong>–pathspec-from-file</strong>. Pathspec elements are
separated with NUL character and all other characters are taken
literally (including newlines and quotes).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;branch&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Branch to checkout; if it refers to a branch (i.e., a name that, when
prepended with &#34;refs/heads/&#34;, is a valid ref), then that branch is
checked out. Otherwise, if it refers to a valid commit, your <strong>HEAD</strong>
becomes &#34;detached&#34; and you are no longer on any branch (see below for
details).</p>
<p>
You can use the <strong>@{-N}</strong> syntax to refer to the N-th last branch/commit
checked out using &#34;git checkout&#34; operation. You may also specify <strong>-</strong>
which is synonymous to <strong>@{-1}</strong>.</p>
<p>
As a special case, you may use <strong>A…B</strong> as a shortcut for the merge base
of <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> if there is exactly one merge base. You can leave out at

DETACHED HEAD
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>HEAD</strong> normally refers to a named branch (e.g. <strong>master</strong>). Meanwhile,
each branch refers to a specific commit. Let&#39;s look at a repo with three
commits, one of them tagged, and with branch <strong>master</strong> checked out:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
           HEAD (refers to branch master)
            |
            v
a---b---c  branch master (refers to commit c)
    ^
    |
  tag v2.0 (refers to commit b)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
When a commit is created in this state, the branch is updated to refer
to the new commit. Specifically, <em>git commit</em> creates a new commit <strong>d</strong>,
whose parent is commit <strong>c</strong>, and then updates branch <strong>master</strong> to refer to
new commit <strong>d</strong>. <strong>HEAD</strong> still refers to branch <strong>master</strong> and so indirectly
now refers to commit <strong>d</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ edit; git add; git commit

               HEAD (refers to branch master)
                |
                v
a---b---c---d  branch master (refers to commit d)
    ^
    |
  tag v2.0 (refers to commit b)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is sometimes useful to be able to checkout a commit that is not at
the tip of any named branch, or even to create a new commit that is not
referenced by a named branch. Let&#39;s look at what happens when we
checkout commit <strong>b</strong> (here we show two ways this may be done):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git checkout v2.0  # or
$ git checkout master^^

   HEAD (refers to commit b)
    |
    v
a---b---c---d  branch master (refers to commit d)
    ^
    |
  tag v2.0 (refers to commit b)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Notice that regardless of which checkout command we use, <strong>HEAD</strong> now
refers directly to commit <strong>b</strong>. This is known as being in detached <strong>HEAD</strong>
state. It means simply that <strong>HEAD</strong> refers to a specific commit, as
opposed to referring to a named branch. Let&#39;s see what happens when we
create a commit:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ edit; git add; git commit

     HEAD (refers to commit e)
      |
      v
      e
     /
a---b---c---d  branch master (refers to commit d)
    ^
    |
  tag v2.0 (refers to commit b)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is now a new commit <strong>e</strong>, but it is referenced only by <strong>HEAD</strong>. We
can of course add yet another commit in this state:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ edit; git add; git commit

         HEAD (refers to commit f)
          |
          v
      e---f
     /
a---b---c---d  branch master (refers to commit d)
    ^
    |
  tag v2.0 (refers to commit b)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In fact, we can perform all the normal Git operations. But, let&#39;s look
at what happens when we then checkout <strong>master</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git checkout master

               HEAD (refers to branch master)
      e---f     |
     /          v
a---b---c---d  branch master (refers to commit d)
    ^
    |
  tag v2.0 (refers to commit b)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is important to realize that at this point nothing refers to commit
<strong>f</strong>. Eventually commit <strong>f</strong> (and by extension commit <strong>e</strong>) will be deleted
by the routine Git garbage collection process, unless we create a
reference before that happens. If we have not yet moved away from commit
<strong>f</strong>, any of these will create a reference to it:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git checkout -b foo  # or &#34;git switch -c foo&#34;  (1)
$ git branch foo                                 (2)
$ git tag foo                                    (3)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<table>

<tr>

If we have moved away from commit <strong>f</strong>, then we must first recover its
object name (typically by using git reflog), and then we can create a
reference to it. For example, to see the last two commits to which
<strong>HEAD</strong> referred, we can use either of these commands:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git reflog -2 HEAD # or
$ git log -g -2 HEAD
</pre>

ARGUMENT DISAMBIGUATION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When there is only one argument given and it is not <strong>–</strong> (e.g. <strong>git
checkout abc</strong>), and when the argument is both a valid <strong>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</strong> (e.g.
a branch <strong>abc</strong> exists) and a valid <strong>&lt;pathspec&gt;</strong> (e.g. a file or a
directory whose name is &#34;abc&#34; exists), Git would usually ask you to
disambiguate. Because checking out a branch is so common an operation,
however, <strong>git checkout abc</strong> takes &#34;abc&#34; as a <strong>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</strong> in such a
situation. Use <strong>git checkout – &lt;pathspec&gt;</strong> if you want to checkout
these paths out of the index.</p>

<p>The following sequence checks out the <strong>master</strong> branch, reverts the
<strong>Makefile</strong> to two revisions back, deletes <strong>hello.c</strong> by mistake, and gets

<p>
If you want to check out <em>all</em> C source files out of the index, you can
say</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git checkout -- *.c
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note the quotes around <strong>*.c</strong>. The file <strong>hello.c</strong> will also be checked
out, even though it is no longer in the working tree, because the file
globbing is used to match entries in the index (not in the working tree
by the shell).</p>
<p>
If you have an unfortunate branch that is named <strong>hello.c</strong>, this step
would be confused as an instruction to switch to that branch. You should
instead write:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git checkout -- hello.c
</pre>

2. Merge
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-3">
<p>After working in the wrong branch, switching to the correct branch would
be done using:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git checkout mytopic
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, your &#34;wrong&#34; branch and correct <strong>mytopic</strong> branch may differ in
files that you have modified locally, in which case the above checkout
would fail like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git checkout mytopic
error: You have local changes to frotz; not switching branches.
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
You can give the <strong>-m</strong> flag to the command, which would try a three-way
merge:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git checkout -m mytopic
Auto-merging frotz
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
After this three-way merge, the local modifications are <em>not</em> registered
in your index file, so <strong>git diff</strong> would show you what changes you made
since the tip of the new branch.</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-10" class="outline-3">

3. Merge conflict
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-3">
<p>When a merge conflict happens during switching branches with the <strong>-m</strong>
option, you would see something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git checkout -m mytopic
Auto-merging frotz
ERROR: Merge conflict in frotz
fatal: merge program failed
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
At this point, <strong>git diff</strong> shows the changes cleanly merged as in the
previous example, as well as the changes in the conflicted files. Edit
and resolve the conflict and mark it resolved with <strong>git add</strong> as usual:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ edit frotz
$ git add frotz

checkout.defaultRemote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you run <strong>git checkout &lt;something&gt;</strong> or <strong>git switch &lt;something&gt;</strong> and
only have one remote, it may implicitly fall back on checking out and
tracking e.g. <strong>origin/&lt;something&gt;</strong>. This stops working as soon as you
have more than one remote with a <strong>&lt;something&gt;</strong> reference. This setting
allows for setting the name of a preferred remote that should always win
when it comes to disambiguation. The typical use-case is to set this to
<strong>origin</strong>.</p>
<p>
Currently this is used by <strong>git-switch*(1) and *git-checkout*(1) when
*git checkout &lt;something&gt;</strong> or <strong>git switch &lt;something&gt;</strong> will checkout the
<strong>&lt;something&gt;</strong> branch on another remote, and by <strong>git-worktree*(1) when
*git worktree add</strong> refers to a remote branch. This setting might be used
for other checkout-like commands or functionality in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
checkout.guess</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provides the default value for the <strong>–guess</strong> or <strong>–no-guess</strong> option in
<strong>git checkout</strong> and <strong>git switch</strong>. See *git-switch*(1) and
*git-checkout*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
checkout.workers</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of parallel workers to use when updating the working tree.
The default is one, i.e. sequential execution. If set to a value less
than one, Git will use as many workers as the number of logical cores
available. This setting and <strong>checkout.thresholdForParallelism</strong> affect
all commands that perform checkout. E.g. checkout, clone, reset,
sparse-checkout, etc.</p>
<p>
Note: Parallel checkout usually delivers better performance for
repositories located on SSDs or over NFS. For repositories on spinning
disks and/or machines with a small number of cores, the default
sequential checkout often performs better. The size and compression
level of a repository might also influence how well the parallel version
performs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
checkout.thresholdForParallelism</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When running parallel checkout with a small number of files, the cost of
subprocess spawning and inter-process communication might outweigh the
parallelization gains. This setting allows you to define the minimum
number of files for which parallel checkout should be attempted. The
default is 100.</p>
