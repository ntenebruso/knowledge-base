SYNOPSIS

<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>curl [options / URLs]</strong></p>

DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>curl</strong> is a tool for transferring data from or to a server using URLs.
It supports these protocols: DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS,
HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS,
RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET, TFTP, WS and WSS.</p>
<p>
curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related features. See
<em>libcurl(3)</em> for details.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-4">
URL
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The URL syntax is protocol-dependent. You find a detailed description in
RFC 3986.</p>
<p>
If you provide a URL without a leading <strong>protocol://</strong> scheme, curl
guesses what protocol you want. It then defaults to HTTP but assumes
others based on often-used hostname prefixes. For example, for hostnames
starting with &#34;ftp.&#34; curl assumes you want FTP.</p>
<p>
You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line. They are fetched
in a sequential manner in the specified order unless you use <em>-Z,
–parallel</em>. You can specify command line options and URLs mixed and in
any order on the command line.</p>
<p>
curl attempts to reuse connections when doing multiple transfers, so
that getting many files from the same server do not use multiple
connects and setup handshakes. This improves speed. Connection reuse can
only be done for URLs specified for a single command line invocation and
cannot be performed between separate curl runs.</p>
<p>
Provide an IPv6 zone id in the URL with an escaped percentage sign. Like
in</p>
<pre class="example">
&#34;http://[fe80::3%25eth0]/&#34;
</pre>
<p>
Everything provided on the command line that is not a command line
option or its argument, curl assumes is a URL and treats it as such.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-5">
GLOBBING
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing lists within
braces or ranges within brackets. We call this &#34;globbing&#34;.</p>
<p>
Provide a list with three different names like this:</p>
<pre class="example">
&#34;http://site.{one,two,three}.com&#34;
</pre>
<p>
Do sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:</p>
<pre class="example">
&#34;ftp://ftp.example.com/file[1-100].txt&#34;
</pre>
<p>
With leading zeroes:</p>
<pre class="example">
&#34;ftp://ftp.example.com/file[001-100].txt&#34;
</pre>
<p>
With letters through the alphabet:</p>
<pre class="example">
&#34;ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a-z].txt&#34;
</pre>
<p>
Nested sequences are not supported, but you can use several ones next to
each other:</p>
<pre class="example">
&#34;http://example.com/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html&#34;
</pre>
<p>
You can specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number or
letter:</p>
<pre class="example">
&#34;http://example.com/file[1-100:10].txt&#34;

&#34;http://example.com/file[a-z:2].txt&#34;
</pre>
<p>
When using [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line prompt,
you probably have to put the full URL within double quotes to avoid the
shell from interfering with it. This also goes for other characters
treated special, like for example &#39;&amp;&#39;, &#39;?&#39; and &#39;*&#39;.</p>
<p>
Switch off globbing with <em>-g, –globoff</em>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="headline-6">
VARIABLES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>curl supports command line variables (added in 8.3.0). Set variables
with <em>–variable</em> name=content or <em>–variable</em> name@file (where &#34;file&#34;
can be stdin if set to a single dash (-)).</p>
<p>
Variable contents can be expanded in option parameters using &#34;{{name}}&#34;
if the option name is prefixed with &#34;<em>–expand-</em>&#34;. This gets the
contents of the variable &#34;name&#34; inserted, or a blank if the name does
not exist as a variable. Insert &#34;{{&#34; verbatim in the string by prefixing
it with a backslash, like &#34;\{{&#34;.</p>
<p>
You an access and expand environment variables by first importing them.
You can select to either require the environment variable to be set or
you can provide a default value in case it is not already set. Plain
<em>–variable</em> %name imports the variable called &#39;name&#39; but exits with an
error if that environment variable is not already set. To provide a
default value if it is not set, use <em>–variable</em> %name=content or
<em>–variable</em> %name@content.</p>
<p>
Example. Get the USER environment variable into the URL, fail if USER is
not set:</p>
<pre class="example">
--variable &#39;%USER&#39;
--expand-url = &#34;https://example.com/api/{{USER}}/method&#34;
</pre>
<p>
When expanding variables, curl supports a set of functions that can make
the variable contents more convenient to use. It can trim leading and
trailing white space with &#34;trim&#34;, it can output the contents as a JSON
quoted string with &#34;json&#34;, URL encode the string with &#34;url&#34; or base64
encode it with &#34;b64&#34;. To apply functions to a variable expansion, add
them colon separated to the right side of the variable. Variable content
holding null bytes that are not encoded when expanded cause error.</p>
<p>
Example: get the contents of a file called $HOME/.secret into a variable
called &#34;fix&#34;. Make sure that the content is trimmed and percent-encoded
when sent as POST data:</p>
<pre class="example">
--variable %HOME
--expand-variable fix@{{HOME}}/.secret
--expand-data &#34;{{fix:trim:url}}&#34;
https://example.com/
</pre>
<p>
Command line variables and expansions were added in 8.3.0.</p>

<h2 id="headline-7">
OUTPUT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>If not told otherwise, curl writes the received data to stdout. It can
be instructed to instead save that data into a local file, using the
<em>-o, –output</em> or <em>-O, –remote-name</em> options. If curl is given multiple
URLs to transfer on the command line, it similarly needs multiple
options for where to save them.</p>
<p>
curl does not parse or otherwise &#34;understand&#34; the content it gets or
writes as output. It does no encoding or decoding, unless explicitly
asked to with dedicated command line options.</p>

PROTOCOLS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>curl supports numerous protocols, or put in URL terms: schemes. Your
particular build may not support them all.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
DICT

<h2 id="headline-9">
PROGRESS METER
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p>curl normally displays a progress meter during operations, indicating
the amount of transferred data, transfer speeds and estimated time left,
etc. The progress meter displays the transfer rate in bytes per second.
The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based. For example 1k is 1024
bytes. 1M is 1048576 bytes.</p>
<p>
curl displays this data to the terminal by default, so if you invoke
curl to do an operation and it is about to write data to the terminal,
it <em>disables</em> the progress meter as otherwise it would mess up the
output mixing progress meter and response data.</p>
<p>
If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you need to
redirect the response output to a file, using shell redirect (&gt;), <em>-o,
–output</em> or similar.</p>
<p>
This does not apply to FTP upload as that operation does not spit out
any response data to the terminal.</p>
<p>
If you prefer a progress bar instead of the regular meter, <em>-#,
–progress-bar</em> is your friend. You can also disable the progress meter
completely with the <em>-s, –silent</em> option.</p>

<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-2">
<p>This man page describes curl 8.9.1. If you use a later version, chances
are this man page does not fully document it. If you use an earlier
version, this document tries to include version information about which
specific version that introduced changes.</p>
<p>
You can always learn which the latest curl version is by running</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-11" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-11">
OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Options start with one or two dashes. Many of the options require an
additional value next to them. If provided text does not start with a
dash, it is presumed to be and treated as a URL.</p>
<p>
The short &#34;single-dash&#34; form of the options, -d for example, may be used
with or without a space between it and its value, although a space is a
recommended separator. The long double-dash form, <em>-d, –data</em> for
example, requires a space between it and its value.</p>
<p>
Short version options that do not need any additional values can be used
immediately next to each other, like for example you can specify all the
options <em>-O</em>, <em>-L</em> and <em>-v</em> at once as <em>-OLv</em>.</p>
<p>
In general, all boolean options are enabled with –<strong>option</strong> and yet
again disabled with –*no-*option. That is, you use the same option name
but prefix it with &#34;no-&#34;. However, in this list we mostly only list and
show the –<strong>option</strong> version of them.</p>
<p>
When <em>-:, –next</em> is used, it resets the parser state and you start
again with a clean option state, except for the options that are global.
Global options retain their values and meaning even after <em>-:, –next</em>.</p>
<p>
The following options are global: <em>–fail-early</em>, <em>–libcurl</em>,
<em>–parallel-immediate</em>, <em>–parallel-max</em>, <em>-Z, –parallel</em>, <em>-#,
–progress-bar</em>, <em>–rate</em>, <em>-S, –show-error</em>, <em>–stderr</em>,
<em>–styled-output</em>, <em>–trace-ascii</em>, <em>–trace-config</em>, <em>–trace-ids</em>,
<em>–trace-time</em>, <em>–trace</em> and <em>-v, –verbose</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–abstract-unix-socket &lt;path&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Connect through an abstract
Unix domain socket, instead of using the network. Note: netstat shows
the path of an abstract socket prefixed with &#34;@&#34;, however the &lt;path&gt;
argument should not have this leading character.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If –abstract-unix-socket is provided several times, the last set value
is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --abstract-unix-socket socketpath https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–unix-socket</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–alt-svc &lt;filename&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTPS) Enable the alt-svc parser. If the
filename points to an existing alt-svc cache file, that gets used.
After a completed transfer, the cache is saved to the filename again
if it has been modified.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specify a &#34;&#34; filename (zero length) to avoid loading/saving and make
curl just handle the cache in memory.</p>
<p>
If this option is used several times, curl loads contents from all the
files but the last one is used for saving.</p>
<p>
–alt-svc can be used several times in a command line</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --alt-svc svc.txt https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
Added in 7.64.1. See also <em>–resolve</em> and <em>–connect-to</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–anyauth
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Figure out authentication method automatically,
and use the most secure one the remote site claims to support. This is
done by first doing a request and checking the response-headers, thus
possibly inducing an extra network round-trip. This option is used
instead of setting a specific authentication method, which you can do
with <em>–basic</em>, <em>–digest</em>, <em>–ntlm</em>, and <em>–negotiate</em>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Using <em>–anyauth</em> is not recommended if you do uploads from stdin, since
it may require data to be sent twice and then the client must be able to
rewind. If the need should arise when uploading from stdin, the upload
operation fails.</p>
<p>
Used together with <em>-u, –user</em>.</p>
<p>
Providing –anyauth multiple times has no extra effect.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --anyauth --user me:pwd https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–proxy-anyauth</em>, <em>–basic</em> and <em>–digest</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-a, –append
</dt>
<dd>(FTP SFTP) When used in an upload, this option makes
curl append to the target file instead of overwriting it. If the
remote file does not exist, it is created. Note that this flag is
ignored by some SFTP servers (including OpenSSH).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Providing –append multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it again
with –no-append.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --upload-file local --append ftp://example.com/
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-r, –range</em> and <em>-C, –continue-at</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–aws-sigv4 &lt;provider1[:prvdr2[:reg[:srv]]]&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Use AWS V4
signature authentication in the transfer.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The provider argument is a string that is used by the algorithm when
creating outgoing authentication headers.</p>
<p>
The region argument is a string that points to a geographic area of a
resources collection (region-code) when the region name is omitted from
the endpoint.</p>
<p>
The service argument is a string that points to a function provided by a
cloud (service-code) when the service name is omitted from the endpoint.</p>
<p>
If –aws-sigv4 is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --aws-sigv4 &#34;aws:amz:us-east-2:es&#34; --user &#34;key:secret&#34; https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
Added in 7.75.0. See also <em>–basic</em> and <em>-u, –user</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–basic
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Use HTTP Basic authentication with the remote host.
This method is the default and this option is usually pointless,
unless you use it to override a previously set option that sets a
different authentication method (such as <em>–ntlm</em>, <em>–digest</em>, or
<em>–negotiate</em>).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Used together with <em>-u, –user</em>.</p>
<p>
Providing –basic multiple times has no extra effect.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl -u name:password --basic https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–proxy-basic</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–ca-native
</dt>
<dd>(TLS) Use the CA store from the native operating system
to verify the peer. By default, curl otherwise uses a CA store
provided in a single file or directory, but when using this option it
interfaces the operating system&#39;s own vault.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This option works for curl on Windows when built to use OpenSSL, wolfSSL
(added in 8.3.0) or GnuTLS (added in 8.5.0). When curl on Windows is
built to use Schannel, this feature is implied and curl then only uses
the native CA store.</p>
<p>
Providing –ca-native multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it
again with –no-ca-native.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --ca-native https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
Added in 8.2.0. See also <em>–cacert</em>, <em>–capath</em> and <em>-k, –insecure</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–cacert &lt;file&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(TLS) Use the specified certificate file to verify
the peer. The file may contain multiple CA certificates. The
certificate(s) must be in PEM format. Normally curl is built to use a
default file for this, so this option is typically used to alter that
default file.</dd>
</dl>
<p>curl recognizes the environment variable named &#39;CURL_CA_BUNDLE&#39; if it is
set and the TLS backend is not Schannel, and uses the given path as a
path to a CA cert bundle. This option overrides that variable.</p>
<p>
The windows version of curl automatically looks for a CA certs file
named &#39;curl-ca-bundle.crt&#39;, either in the same directory as curl.exe, or
in the Current Working Directory, or in any folder along your PATH.</p>
<p>
(iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport, then
this option is supported for backward compatibility with other SSL
engines, but it should not be set. If the option is not set, then curl
uses the certificates in the system and user Keychain to verify the
peer, which is the preferred method of verifying the peer&#39;s certificate
chain.</p>
<p>
(Schannel only) This option is supported for Schannel in Windows 7 or
later (added in 7.60.0). This option is supported for backward
compatibility with other SSL engines; instead it is recommended to use
Windows&#39; store of root certificates (the default for Schannel).</p>
<p>
If –cacert is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --cacert CA-file.txt https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–capath</em> and <em>-k, –insecure</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–capath &lt;dir&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(TLS) Use the specified certificate directory to
verify the peer. Multiple paths can be provided by separated with
colon (&#34;:&#34;) (e.g. &#34;path1:path2:path3&#34;). The certificates must be in
PEM format, and if curl is built against OpenSSL, the directory must
have been processed using the c_rehash utility supplied with OpenSSL.
Using <em>–capath</em> can allow OpenSSL-powered curl to make
SSL-connections much more efficiently than using <em>–cacert</em> if the
<em>–cacert</em> file contains many CA certificates.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If this option is set, the default capath value is ignored.</p>
<p>
If –capath is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --capath /local/directory https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–cacert</em> and <em>-k, –insecure</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-E, –cert &lt;certificate[:password]&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(TLS) Use the specified client
certificate file when getting a file with HTTPS, FTPS or another
SSL-based protocol. The certificate must be in PKCS#12 format if using
Secure Transport, or PEM format if using any other engine. If the
optional password is not specified, it is queried for on the terminal.
Note that this option assumes a certificate file that is the private
key and the client certificate concatenated. See <em>-E, –cert</em> and
<em>–key</em> to specify them independently.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the &lt;certificate&gt; portion of the argument, you must escape the
character &#34;:&#34; as &#34;\:&#34; so that it is not recognized as the password
delimiter. Similarly, you must escape the double quote character as \&#34;
so that it is not recognized as an escape character.</p>
<p>
If curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine pkcs11 is
available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be used to specify a
certificate located in a PKCS#11 device. A string beginning with
&#34;pkcs11:&#34; is interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI. If a PKCS#11 URI is provided,
then the <em>–engine</em> option is set as &#34;pkcs11&#34; if none was provided and
the <em>–cert-type</em> option is set as &#34;ENG&#34; if none was provided.</p>
<p>
(iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport, then the
certificate string can either be the name of a certificate/private key
in the system or user keychain, or the path to a PKCS#12-encoded
certificate and private key. If you want to use a file from the current
directory, please precede it with &#34;./&#34; prefix, in order to avoid
confusion with a nickname.</p>
<p>
(Schannel only) Client certificates must be specified by a path
expression to a certificate store. (Loading <em>PFX</em> is not supported; you
can import it to a store first). You can use &#34;&lt;store location&gt;\&lt;store
name&gt;\&lt;thumbprint&gt;&#34; to refer to a certificate in the system certificates
store, for example,
<em>&#34;CurrentUser\MY\934a7ac6f8a5d579285a74fa61e19f23ddfe8d7a&#34;</em>. Thumbprint
is usually a SHA-1 hex string which you can see in certificate details.
Following store locations are supported: <em>CurrentUser</em>, <em>LocalMachine</em>,
<em>CurrentService</em>, <em>Services</em>, <em>CurrentUserGroupPolicy</em>,
<em>LocalMachineGroupPolicy</em> and <em>LocalMachineEnterprise</em>.</p>
<p>
If –cert is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --cert certfile --key keyfile https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–cert-type</em>, <em>–key</em> and <em>–key-type</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–cert-status
</dt>
<dd>(TLS) Verify the status of the server certificate by
using the Certificate Status Request (aka. OCSP stapling) TLS
extension.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If this option is enabled and the server sends an invalid (e.g. expired)
response, if the response suggests that the server certificate has been
revoked, or no response at all is received, the verification fails.</p>
<p>
This support is currently only implemented in the OpenSSL and GnuTLS
backends.</p>
<p>
Providing –cert-status multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it
again with –no-cert-status.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --cert-status https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–pinnedpubkey</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–cert-type &lt;type&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(TLS) Set type of the provided client
certificate. PEM, DER, ENG and P12 are recognized types.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The default type depends on the TLS backend and is usually PEM, however
for Secure Transport and Schannel it is P12. If <em>-E, –cert</em> is a
pkcs11: URI then ENG is the default type.</p>
<p>
If –cert-type is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --cert-type PEM --cert file https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-E, –cert</em>, <em>–key</em> and <em>–key-type</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–ciphers &lt;list of ciphers&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(TLS) Specifies which ciphers to use in
the connection. The list of ciphers must specify valid ciphers. Read
up on SSL cipher list details on this URL:</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html">https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html</a></p>
<p>
If –ciphers is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-CCM8 https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–tlsv1.3</em>, <em>–tls13-ciphers</em> and <em>–proxy-ciphers</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–compressed
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the
algorithms curl supports, and automatically decompress the content.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Response headers are not modified when saved, so if they are
&#34;interpreted&#34; separately again at a later point they might appear to be
saying that the content is (still) compressed; while in fact it has
already been decompressed.</p>
<p>
If this option is used and the server sends an unsupported encoding,
curl reports an error. This is a request, not an order; the server may
or may not deliver data compressed.</p>
<p>
Providing –compressed multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it
again with –no-compressed.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --compressed https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–compressed-ssh</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–compressed-ssh
</dt>
<dd>(SCP SFTP) Enables built-in SSH compression. This
is a request, not an order; the server may or may not do it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Providing –compressed-ssh multiple times has no extra effect. Disable
it again with –no-compressed-ssh.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --compressed-ssh sftp://example.com/
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–compressed</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-K, –config &lt;file&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Specify a text file to read curl arguments
from. The command line arguments found in the text file are used as if
they were provided on the command line.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Options and their parameters must be specified on the same line in the
file, separated by whitespace, colon, or the equals sign. Long option
names can optionally be given in the config file without the initial
double dashes and if so, the colon or equals characters can be used as
separators. If the option is specified with one or two dashes, there can
be no colon or equals character between the option and its parameter.</p>
<p>
If the parameter contains whitespace or starts with a colon (:) or
equals sign (=), it must be specified enclosed within double quotes
(&#34;like this&#34;). Within double quotes the following escape sequences are
available: \\, \&#34;, \t, \n, \r and \v. A backslash preceding any other
letter is ignored.</p>
<p>
If the first non-blank column of a config line is a &#39;#&#39; character, that
line is treated as a comment.</p>
<p>
Only write one option per physical line in the config file. A single
line is required to be no more than 10 megabytes (since 8.2.0).</p>
<p>
Specify the filename to <em>-K, –config</em> as minus &#34;-&#34; to make curl read
the file from stdin.</p>
<p>
Note that to be able to specify a URL in the config file, you need to
specify it using the <em>–url</em> option, and not by simply writing the URL
on its own line. So, it could look similar to this:</p>
<pre class="example">
url = &#34;https://curl.se/docs/&#34;

# --- Example file ---
# this is a comment
url = &#34;example.com&#34;
output = &#34;curlhere.html&#34;
user-agent = &#34;superagent/1.0&#34;

# and fetch another URL too
url = &#34;example.com/docs/manpage.html&#34;
-O
referer = &#34;http://nowhereatall.example.com/&#34;
# --- End of example file ---
</pre>
<p>
When curl is invoked, it (unless <em>-q, –disable</em> is used) checks for a
default config file and uses it if found, even when <em>-K, –config</em> is
used. The default config file is checked for in the following places in
this order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>&#34;$CURL_HOME/.curlrc&#34;</strong></li>
<li><strong>&#34;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/curlrc&#34;</strong> (Added in 7.73.0)</li>
<li><strong>&#34;$HOME/.curlrc&#34;</strong></li>
<li>Windows: <strong>&#34;%USERPROFILE%\.curlrc&#34;</strong></li>
<li>Windows: <strong>&#34;%APPDATA%\.curlrc&#34;</strong></li>
<li>Windows: <strong>&#34;%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\.curlrc&#34;</strong></li>
<li>Non-Windows: use getpwuid to find the home directory</li>
<li>On Windows, if it finds no <em>.curlrc</em> file in the sequence described</li>
</ol>
<p>above, it checks for one in the same directory the curl executable is
placed.</p>
<p>
On Windows two filenames are checked per location: <em>.curlrc</em> and
<em>_curlrc</em>, preferring the former. Older versions on Windows checked for
<em>_curlrc</em> only.</p>
<p>
–config can be used several times in a command line</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --config file.txt https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-q, –disable</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–connect-timeout &lt;seconds&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Maximum time in seconds that you allow
curl&#39;s connection to take. This only limits the connection phase, so
if curl connects within the given period it continues - if not it
exits.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This option accepts decimal values. The decimal value needs to be
provided using a dot (.) as decimal separator - not the local version
even if it might be using another separator.</p>
<p>
The connection phase is considered complete when the DNS lookup and
requested TCP, TLS or QUIC handshakes are done.</p>
<p>
If –connect-timeout is provided several times, the last set value is
used.</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --connect-timeout 20 https://example.com
 curl --connect-timeout 3.14 https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-m, –max-time</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–connect-to &lt;HOST1:PORT1:HOST2:PORT2&gt;
</dt>
<dd>For a request intended for
the &#34;HOST1:PORT1&#34; pair, connect to &#34;HOST2:PORT2&#34; instead. This option
is only used to establish the network connection. It does NOT affect
the hostname/port number that is used for TLS/SSL (e.g. SNI,
certificate verification) or for the application protocols.</dd>
</dl>
<p>&#34;HOST1&#34; and &#34;PORT1&#34; may be empty strings, meaning any host or any port
number. &#34;HOST2&#34; and &#34;PORT2&#34; may also be empty strings, meaning use the
request&#39;s original hostname and port number.</p>
<p>
A hostname specified to this option is compared as a string, so it needs
to match the name used in request URL. It can be either numerical such
as &#34;127.0.0.1&#34; or the full host name such as &#34;example.org&#34;.</p>
<p>
Example: redirect connects from the example.com hostname to 127.0.0.1
independently of port number:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl --connect-to example.com::127.0.0.1: https://example.com/
</pre>
<p>
Example: redirect connects from all hostnames to 127.0.0.1 independently
of port number:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl --connect-to ::127.0.0.1: http://example.com/
</pre>
<p>
–connect-to can be used several times in a command line</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --connect-to example.com:443:example.net:8443 https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–resolve</em> and <em>-H, –header</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-C, –continue-at &lt;offset&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Resume a previous transfer from the
given byte offset. The given offset is the exact number of bytes that
are skipped, counting from the beginning of the source file before it
is transferred to the destination. If used with uploads, the FTP
server command SIZE is not used by curl.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Use &#34;-C -&#34; to instruct curl to automatically find out where/how to
resume the transfer. It then uses the given output/input files to figure
that out.</p>
<p>
If –continue-at is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl -C - https://example.com
 curl -C 400 https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-r, –range</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-b, –cookie &lt;data|filename&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP
server in the Cookie header. It is supposedly the data previously
received from the server in a &#34;Set-Cookie:&#34; line. The data should be
in the format &#34;NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2&#34; or as a single filename.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When given a set of specific cookies and not a filename, it makes curl
use the cookie header with this content explicitly in all outgoing
request(s). If multiple requests are done due to authentication,
followed redirects or similar, they all get this cookie header passed
on.</p>
<p>
If no &#34;=&#34; symbol is used in the argument, it is instead treated as a
filename to read previously stored cookie from. This option also
activates the cookie engine which makes curl record incoming cookies,
which may be handy if you are using this in combination with the <em>-L,
–location</em> option or do multiple URL transfers on the same invoke.</p>
<p>
If the filename is a single minus (&#34;-&#34;), curl reads the contents from
stdin. If the filename is an empty string (&#34;&#34;) and is the only cookie
input, curl activates the cookie engine without any cookies.</p>
<p>
The file format of the file to read cookies from should be plain HTTP
headers (Set-Cookie style) or the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format.</p>
<p>
The file specified with <em>-b, –cookie</em> is only used as input. No cookies
are written to that file. To store cookies, use the <em>-c, –cookie-jar</em>
option.</p>
<p>
If you use the Set-Cookie file format and do not specify a domain then
the cookie is not sent since the domain never matches. To address this,
set a domain in Set-Cookie line (doing that includes subdomains) or
preferably: use the Netscape format.</p>
<p>
Users often want to both read cookies from a file and write updated
cookies back to a file, so using both <em>-b, –cookie</em> and <em>-c,
–cookie-jar</em> in the same command line is common.</p>
<p>
If curl is built with PSL (<strong>Public Suffix List</strong>) support, it detects and
discards cookies that are specified for such suffix domains that should
not be allowed to have cookies. If curl is <em>not</em> built with PSL support,
it has no ability to stop super cookies.</p>
<p>
–cookie can be used several times in a command line</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl -b &#34;&#34; https://example.com
 curl -b cookiefile https://example.com
 curl -b cookiefile -c cookiefile https://example.com
 curl -b name=Jane https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-c, –cookie-jar</em> and <em>-j, –junk-session-cookies</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-c, –cookie-jar &lt;filename&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Specify to which file you want
curl to write all cookies after a completed operation. Curl writes all
cookies from its in-memory cookie storage to the given file at the end
of operations. Even if no cookies are known, a file is created so that
it removes any formerly existing cookies from the file. The file uses
the Netscape cookie file format. If you set the filename to a single
minus, &#34;-&#34;, the cookies are written to stdout.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The file specified with <em>-c, –cookie-jar</em> is only used for output. No
cookies are read from the file. To read cookies, use the <em>-b, –cookie</em>
option. Both options can specify the same file.</p>
<p>
This command line option activates the cookie engine that makes curl
record and use cookies. The <em>-b, –cookie</em> option also activates it.</p>
<p>
If the cookie jar cannot be created or written to, the whole curl
operation does not fail or even report an error clearly. Using <em>-v,
–verbose</em> gets a warning displayed, but that is the only visible
feedback you get about this possibly lethal situation.</p>
<p>
If –cookie-jar is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl -c store-here.txt https://example.com
 curl -c store-here.txt -b read-these https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-b, –cookie</em> and <em>-j, –junk-session-cookies</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–create-dirs
</dt>
<dd>When used in conjunction with the <em>-o, –output</em>
option, curl creates the necessary local directory hierarchy as
needed. This option creates the directories mentioned with the <em>-o,
–output</em> option combined with the path possibly set with
<em>–output-dir</em>. If the combined output filename uses no directory, or
if the directories it mentions already exist, no directories are
created.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Created directories are made with mode 0750 on unix style file systems.</p>
<p>
To create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try
<em>–ftp-create-dirs</em>.</p>
<p>
Providing –create-dirs multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it
again with –no-create-dirs.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --create-dirs --output local/dir/file https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–ftp-create-dirs</em> and <em>–output-dir</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–create-file-mode &lt;mode&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(SFTP SCP FILE) When curl is used to
create files remotely using one of the supported protocols, this
option allows the user to set which &#39;mode&#39; to set on the file at
creation time, instead of the default 0644.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This option takes an octal number as argument.</p>
<p>
If –create-file-mode is provided several times, the last set value is
used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --create-file-mode 0777 -T localfile sftp://example.com/new
</pre>
<p>
Added in 7.75.0. See also <em>–ftp-create-dirs</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–crlf
</dt>
<dd>(FTP SMTP) Convert line feeds to carriage return plus line
feeds in upload. Useful for <strong>MVS (OS/390)</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Providing –crlf multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it again
with –no-crlf.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --crlf -T file ftp://example.com/
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-B, –use-ascii</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–crlfile &lt;file&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(TLS) Provide a file using PEM format with a
Certificate Revocation List that may specify peer certificates that
are to be considered revoked.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If –crlfile is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --crlfile rejects.txt https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–cacert</em> and <em>–capath</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–curves &lt;list&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(TLS) Set specific curves to use during SSL session
establishment according to RFC 8422, 5.1. Multiple algorithms can be
provided by separating them with &#34;:&#34; (e.g. &#34;X25519:P-521&#34;). The
parameter is available identically in the OpenSSL &#34;s_client&#34; and
&#34;s_server&#34; utilities.</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>–curves</em> allows a OpenSSL powered curl to make SSL-connections with
exactly the (EC) curve requested by the client, avoiding nontransparent
client/server negotiations.</p>
<p>
If this option is set, the default curves list built into OpenSSL are
ignored.</p>
<p>
If –curves is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --curves X25519 https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
Added in 7.73.0. See also <em>–ciphers</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-d, –data &lt;data&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP MQTT) Sends the specified data in a POST
request to the HTTP server, in the same way that a browser does when a
user has filled in an HTML form and presses the submit button. This
option makes curl pass the data to the server using the content-type
application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Compare to <em>-F, –form</em>.</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>–data-raw</em> is almost the same but does not have a special
interpretation of the @ character. To post data purely binary, you
should instead use the <em>–data-binary</em> option. To URL-encode the value
of a form field you may use <em>–data-urlencode</em>.</p>
<p>
If any of these options is used more than once on the same command line,
the data pieces specified are merged with a separating &amp;-symbol. Thus,
using &#39;-d name=daniel -d skill=lousy&#39; would generate a post chunk that
looks like &#39;name=daniel&amp;skill=lousy&#39;.</p>
<p>
If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a filename
to read the data from, or - if you want curl to read the data from
stdin. Posting data from a file named &#39;foobar&#39; would thus be done with
<em>-d, –data</em> @foobar. When <em>-d, –data</em> is told to read from a file like
that, carriage returns, newlines and null bytes are stripped out. If you
do not want the @ character to have a special interpretation use
<em>–data-raw</em> instead.</p>
<p>
The data for this option is passed on to the server exactly as provided
on the command line. curl does not convert, change or improve it. It is
up to the user to provide the data in the correct form.</p>
<p>
–data can be used several times in a command line</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl -d &#34;name=curl&#34; https://example.com
 curl -d &#34;name=curl&#34; -d &#34;tool=cmdline&#34; https://example.com
 curl -d @filename https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
This option is mutually exclusive with <em>-F, –form</em>, <em>-I, –head</em> and
<em>-T, –upload-file</em>. See also <em>–data-binary</em>, <em>–data-urlencode</em> and
<em>–data-raw</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–data-ascii &lt;data&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) This option is just an alias for <em>-d,
–data</em>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>–data-ascii can be used several times in a command line</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --data-ascii @file https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–data-binary</em>, <em>–data-raw</em> and <em>–data-urlencode</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–data-binary &lt;data&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Post data exactly as specified with no
extra processing whatsoever.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a filename.
Data is posted in a similar manner as <em>-d, –data</em> does, except that
newlines and carriage returns are preserved and conversions are never
done.</p>
<p>
Like <em>-d, –data</em> the default content-type sent to the server is
application/x-www-form-urlencoded. If you want the data to be treated as
arbitrary binary data by the server then set the content-type to
octet-stream: -H &#34;Content-Type: application/octet-stream&#34;.</p>
<p>
If this option is used several times, the ones following the first
append data as described in <em>-d, –data</em>.</p>
<p>
–data-binary can be used several times in a command line</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --data-binary @filename https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–data-ascii</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–data-raw &lt;data&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Post data similarly to <em>-d, –data</em> but
without the special interpretation of the @ character.</dd>
</dl>
<p>–data-raw can be used several times in a command line</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --data-raw &#34;hello&#34; https://example.com
 curl --data-raw &#34;@at@at@&#34; https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-d, –data</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–data-urlencode &lt;data&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Post data, similar to the other <em>-d,
–data</em> options with the exception that this performs URL-encoding.</dd>
</dl>
<p>To be CGI-compliant, the &lt;data&gt; part should begin with a <em>name</em> followed
by a separator and a content specification. The &lt;data&gt; part can be
passed to curl using one of the following syntaxes:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
content
</dt>
<dd>URL-encode the content and pass that on. Just be careful so
that the content does not contain any &#34;=&#34; or &#34;@&#34; symbols, as that
makes the syntax match one of the other cases below!</dd>
<dt>
=content
</dt>
<dd>URL-encode the content and pass that on. The preceding &#34;=&#34;
symbol is not included in the data.</dd>
<dt>
name=content
</dt>
<dd>URL-encode the content part and pass that on. Note
that the name part is expected to be URL-encoded already.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>load data from the given file (including any newlines), URL-encode
that data and pass it on in the POST.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>
name@filename
</dt>
<dd>load data from the given file (including any
newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it on in the POST. The name
part gets an equal sign appended, resulting in
<em>name=urlencoded-file-content</em>. Note that the name is expected to be
URL-encoded already.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
–data-urlencode can be used several times in a command line</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<pre class="example">

authentication scheme avoids sending the password over the wire in
clear text. Use this in combination with the normal <em>-u, –user</em>
option to set username and password.</dd>

<p>Providing –digest multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it again
with –no-digest.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">

<dl>
<dt>
–disable-eprt
</dt>
<dd>(FTP) Disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT commands
when doing active FTP transfers. Curl normally first attempts to use
EPRT before using PORT, but with this option, it uses PORT right away.
EPRT is an extension to the original FTP protocol, and does not work
on all servers, but enables more functionality in a better way than
the traditional PORT command.</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>–eprt</em> can be used to explicitly enable EPRT again and <em>–no-eprt</em> is
an alias for <em>–disable-eprt</em>.</p>
<p>
If the server is accessed using IPv6, this option has no effect as EPRT
is necessary then.</p>
<p>
Disabling EPRT only changes the active behavior. If you want to switch
to passive mode you need to not use <em>-P, –ftp-port</em> or force it with
<em>–ftp-pasv</em>.</p>
<p>
Providing –disable-eprt multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it
again with –no-disable-eprt.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --disable-eprt ftp://example.com/
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–disable-epsv</em> and <em>-P, –ftp-port</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–disable-epsv
</dt>
<dd>(FTP) Disable the use of the EPSV command when doing
passive FTP transfers. Curl normally first attempts to use EPSV before
PASV, but with this option, it does not try EPSV.</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>–epsv</em> can be used to explicitly enable EPSV again and <em>–no-epsv</em> is
an alias for <em>–disable-epsv</em>.</p>
<p>
If the server is an IPv6 host, this option has no effect as EPSV is
necessary then.</p>
<p>
Disabling EPSV only changes the passive behavior. If you want to switch
to active mode you need to use <em>-P, –ftp-port</em>.</p>
<p>
Providing –disable-epsv multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it

–doh-cert-status
</dt>
<dd>Same as <em>–cert-status</em> but used for DoH
(DNS-over-HTTPS).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Verifies the status of the DoH servers&#39; certificate by using the
Certificate Status Request (aka. OCSP stapling) TLS extension.</p>
<p>
If this option is enabled and the DoH server sends an invalid (e.g.
expired) response, if the response suggests that the server certificate
has been revoked, or no response at all is received, the verification
fails.</p>
<p>
This support is currently only implemented in the OpenSSL and GnuTLS
backends.</p>
<p>
Providing –doh-cert-status multiple times has no extra effect. Disable
it again with –no-doh-cert-status.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">

–doh-insecure
</dt>
<dd>By default, every connection curl makes to a DoH
server is verified to be secure before the transfer takes place. This
option tells curl to skip the verification step and proceed without

</dl>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: using this option makes the DoH transfer and name resolution
insecure.</p>
<p>
This option is equivalent to <em>-k, –insecure</em> and <em>–proxy-insecure</em> but
used for DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS) only.</p>
<p>
Providing –doh-insecure multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it
again with –no-doh-insecure.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">

<p>Some SSL options that you set for your transfer also applies to DoH
since the name lookups take place over SSL. However, the certificate
verification settings are not inherited but are controlled separately
via <em>–doh-insecure</em> and <em>–doh-cert-status</em>.</p>
<p>
This option is unset if an empty string &#34;&#34; is used as the URL. (Added in

–expect100-timeout &lt;seconds&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Maximum time in seconds that

Expects: 100-continue header in its request. By default curl waits one
second. This option accepts decimal values. When curl stops waiting,
it continues as if a response was received.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
-f, –fail
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Fail with error code 22 and with no response body
output at all for HTTP transfers returning HTTP response codes at 400
or greater.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In normal cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a document, it
returns a body of text stating so (which often also describes why and
more) and a 4xx HTTP response code. This command line option prevents
curl from outputting that data and instead returns error 22 early. By
default, curl does not consider HTTP response codes to indicate failure.</p>
<p>
To get both the error code and also save the content, use
<em>–fail-with-body</em> instead.</p>
<p>
This method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where
non-successful response codes slip through, especially when
authentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).</p>
<p>
Providing –fail multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it again
with –no-fail.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --fail https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
This option is mutually exclusive with <em>–fail-with-body</em>. See also
<em>–fail-with-body</em> and <em>–fail-early</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–fail-early
</dt>
<dd>Fail and exit on the first detected transfer error.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When curl is used to do multiple transfers on the command line, it
attempts to operate on each given URL, one by one. By default, it
ignores errors if there are more URLs given and the last URL&#39;s success
determines the error code curl returns. Early failures are &#34;hidden&#34; by
subsequent successful transfers.</p>
<p>
Using this option, curl instead returns an error on the first transfer
that fails, independent of the amount of URLs that are given on the
command line. This way, no transfer failures go undetected by scripts
and similar.</p>
<p>
This option does not imply <em>-f, –fail</em>, which causes transfers to fail
due to the server&#39;s HTTP status code. You can combine the two options,
however note <em>-f, –fail</em> is not global and is therefore contained by
<em>-:, –next</em>.</p>
<p>
This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of
–next.</p>
<p>
Providing –fail-early multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it
again with –no-fail-early.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --fail-early https://example.com https://two.example
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-f, –fail</em> and <em>–fail-with-body</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–fail-with-body
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Return an error on server errors where the
HTTP response code is 400 or greater). In normal cases when an HTTP
server fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML document
stating so (which often also describes why and more). This option
allows curl to output and save that content but also to return
error 22.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is an alternative option to <em>-f, –fail</em> which makes curl fail for
the same circumstances but without saving the content.</p>
<p>
Providing –fail-with-body multiple times has no extra effect. Disable
it again with –no-fail-with-body.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --fail-with-body https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
This option is mutually exclusive with <em>-f, –fail</em>. Added in 7.76.0.
See also <em>-f, –fail</em> and <em>–fail-early</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–false-start
</dt>
<dd>(TLS) Use false start during the TLS handshake. False
start is a mode where a TLS client starts sending application data
before verifying the server&#39;s Finished message, thus saving a round
trip when performing a full handshake.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This functionality is currently only implemented in the Secure Transport
(on iOS 7.0 or later, or OS X 10.9 or later) backend.</p>
<p>
Providing –false-start multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it
again with –no-false-start.</p>

<dl>
<dt>
-F, –form &lt;name=content&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP SMTP IMAP) For the HTTP protocol
family, emulate a filled-in form in which a user has pressed the
submit button. This makes curl POST data using the Content-Type
multipart/form-data according to RFC 2388.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For SMTP and IMAP protocols, this composes a multipart mail message to
transmit.</p>
<p>
This enables uploading of binary files etc. To force the &#39;content&#39; part
to be a file, prefix the filename with an @ sign. To just get the
content part from a file, prefix the filename with the symbol &lt;. The
difference between @ and &lt; is then that @ makes a file get attached in
the post as a file upload, while the &lt; makes a text field and just get
the contents for that text field from a file.</p>
<p>
Read content from stdin instead of a file by using a single &#34;-&#34; as
filename. This goes for both @ and &lt; constructs. When stdin is used, the
contents is buffered in memory first by curl to determine its size and
allow a possible resend. Defining a part&#39;s data from a named non-regular
file (such as a named pipe or similar) is not subject to buffering and
is instead read at transmission time; since the full size is unknown
before the transfer starts, such data is sent as chunks by HTTP and
rejected by IMAP.</p>
<p>
Example: send an image to an HTTP server, where &#39;profile&#39; is the name of
the form-field to which the file <strong>portrait.jpg</strong> is the input:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl -F profile=@portrait.jpg https://example.com/upload.cgi
</pre>
<p>
Example: send your name and shoe size in two text fields to the server:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl -F name=John -F shoesize=11 https://example.com/
</pre>
<p>
Example: send your essay in a text field to the server. Send it as a
plain text field, but get the contents for it from a local file:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl -F &#34;story=&lt;hugefile.txt&#34; https://example.com/
</pre>
<p>
You can also instruct curl what Content-Type to use by using &#34;type=&#34;, in
a manner similar to:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl -F &#34;web=@index.html;type=text/html&#34; example.com
</pre>
<p>
or</p>
<pre class="example">
curl -F &#34;name=daniel;type=text/foo&#34; example.com
</pre>
<p>
You can also explicitly change the name field of a file upload part by
setting filename=, like this:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl -F &#34;file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost&#34; example.com
</pre>
<p>
If filename/path contains &#39;,&#39; or &#39;;&#39;, it must be quoted by double-quotes
like:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl -F &#34;file=@\&#34;local,file\&#34;;filename=\&#34;name;in;post\&#34;&#34; example.com
</pre>
<p>
or</p>
<pre class="example">
curl -F &#39;file=@&#34;local,file&#34;;filename=&#34;name;in;post&#34;&#39; example.com
</pre>
<p>
Note that if a filename/path is quoted by double-quotes, any
double-quote or backslash within the filename must be escaped by
backslash.</p>
<p>
Quoting must also be applied to non-file data if it contains semicolons,
leading/trailing spaces or leading double quotes:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl -F &#39;colors=&#34;red; green; blue&#34;;type=text/x-myapp&#39; example.com
</pre>
<p>
You can add custom headers to the field by setting headers=, like</p>
<pre class="example">
curl -F &#34;submit=OK;headers=\&#34;X-submit-type: OK\&#34;&#34; example.com
</pre>
<p>
or</p>
<pre class="example">
curl -F &#34;submit=OK;headers=@headerfile&#34; example.com
</pre>
<p>
The headers= keyword may appear more that once and above notes about
quoting apply. When headers are read from a file, Empty lines and lines
starting with &#39;#&#39; are comments and ignored; each header can be folded by
splitting between two words and starting the continuation line with a
space; embedded carriage-returns and trailing spaces are stripped. Here
is an example of a header file contents:</p>
<pre class="example">
# This file contain two headers.
X-header-1: this is a header

# The following header is folded.
X-header-2: this is
 another header
</pre>
<p>
To support sending multipart mail messages, the syntax is extended as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>name can be omitted: the equal sign is the first character of the</li>
</ul>
<p>argument,</p>
<ul>
<li>if data starts with &#39;(&#39;, this signals to start a new multipart: it can</li>
</ul>
<p>be followed by a content type specification.</p>
<ul>
<li>a multipart can be terminated with a &#39;=)&#39; argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: the following command sends an SMTP mime email consisting in an
inline part in two alternative formats: plain text and HTML. It attaches
a text file:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl -F &#39;=(;type=multipart/alternative&#39; \
     -F &#39;=plain text message&#39; \
     -F &#39;= &lt;body&gt;HTML message&lt;/body&gt;;type=text/html&#39; \
     -F &#39;=)&#39; -F &#39;=@textfile.txt&#39; ...  smtp://example.com
</pre>
<p>
Data can be encoded for transfer using encoder=. Available encodings are
<em>binary</em> and <em>8bit</em> that do nothing else than adding the corresponding
Content-Transfer-Encoding header, <em>7bit</em> that only rejects 8-bit
characters with a transfer error, <em>quoted-printable</em> and <em>base64</em> that
encodes data according to the corresponding schemes, limiting lines
length to 76 characters.</p>
<p>
Example: send multipart mail with a quoted-printable text message and a
base64 attached file:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl -F &#39;=text message;encoder=quoted-printable&#39; \
     -F &#39;=@localfile;encoder=base64&#39; ... smtp://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See further examples and details in the MANUAL.</p>
<p>
–form can be used several times in a command line</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --form &#34;name=curl&#34; --form &#34;file=@loadthis&#34; https://example.com
</pre>

<dl>
<dt>
multicwd
</dt>
<dd>Do a single CWD operation for each path part in the
given URL. For deep hierarchies this means many commands. This is
how RFC 1738 says it should be done. This is the default but the
slowest behavior.</dd>
<dt>
nocwd
</dt>
<dd>Do no CWD at all. curl does SIZE, RETR, STOR etc and gives
the full path to the server for each of these commands. This is the
fastest behavior.</dd>
<dt>
singlecwd
</dt>
<dd>Do one CWD with the full target directory and then
operate on the file &#34;normally&#34; (like in the multicwd case). This is
somewhat more standards compliant than &#34;nocwd&#34; but without the full
penalty of &#34;multicwd&#34;.</dd>

–ftp-pasv
</dt>
<dd>(FTP) Use passive mode for the data connection. Passive
is the internal default behavior, but using this option can be used to
override a previous <em>-P, –ftp-port</em> option.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Reversing an enforced passive really is not doable but you must then
instead enforce the correct <em>-P, –ftp-port</em> again.</p>
<p>
Passive mode means that curl tries the EPSV command first and then PASV,
unless <em>–disable-epsv</em> is used.</p>
<p>
Providing –ftp-pasv multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it
again with –no-ftp-pasv.</p>

<dl>
<dt>
-P, –ftp-port &lt;address&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>(FTP) Reverses the default
initiator/listener roles when connecting with FTP. This option makes
curl use active mode. curl then commands the server to connect back to
the client&#39;s specified address and port, while passive mode asks the
server to setup an IP address and port for it to connect to. &lt;address&gt;
should be one of:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
interface
</dt>
<dd>e.g. <strong>eth0</strong> to specify which interface&#39;s IP address you
want to use (Unix only)</dd>
<dt>
IP address
</dt>
<dd>e.g. <strong>192.168.10.1</strong> to specify the exact IP address</dd>
<dt>
hostname
</dt>
<dd>e.g. <strong>my.host.domain</strong> to specify the machine</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd>make curl pick the same IP address that is already used for the
control connection. This is the recommended choice.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Disable the use of PORT with <em>–ftp-pasv</em>. Disable the attempt to use
the EPRT command instead of PORT by using <em>–disable-eprt</em>. EPRT is
really PORT++.</p>
<p>
You can also append &#34;:[start]-[end]&#34; to the right of the address, to
tell curl what TCP port range to use. That means you specify a port
range, from a lower to a higher number. A single number works as well,
but do note that it increases the risk of failure since the port may
not be available.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If –ftp-port is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<pre class="example">

passive mode does not initiate the shutdown, but instead waits for the
server to do it, and does not reply to the shutdown from the server.
The active mode initiates the shutdown and waits for a reply from the

an HTTP GET request instead of the POST request that otherwise would
be used. curl appends the provided data to the URL as a query string.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If used in combination with <em>-I, –head</em>, the POST data is instead
appended to the URL with a HEAD request.</p>

–happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms &lt;ms&gt;

<dd>Happy Eyeballs is an algorithm
that attempts to connect to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for
dual-stack hosts, giving IPv6 a head-start of the specified number of
milliseconds. If the IPv6 address cannot be connected to within that
time, then a connection attempt is made to the IPv4 address in
parallel. The first connection to be established is the one that is
used.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The range of suggested useful values is limited. Happy Eyeballs RFC 6555
says &#34;It is RECOMMENDED that connection attempts be paced 150-250 ms
apart to balance human factors against network load.&#34; libcurl currently
defaults to 200 ms. Firefox and Chrome currently default to 300 ms.</p>
<p>
If –happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms is provided several times, the last set

–haproxy-clientip &lt;ip&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Sets a client IP in HAProxy PROXY
protocol v1 header at the beginning of the connection.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For valid requests, IPv4 addresses must be indicated as a series of
exactly 4 integers in the range [0..255] inclusive written in decimal
representation separated by exactly one dot between each other. Heading
zeroes are not permitted in front of numbers in order to avoid any
possible confusion with octal numbers. IPv6 addresses must be indicated
as series of 4 hexadecimal digits (upper or lower case) delimited by
colons between each other, with the acceptance of one double colon
sequence to replace the largest acceptable range of consecutive zeroes.
The total number of decoded bits must exactly be 128.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, any string can be accepted for the client IP and get sent.</p>
<p>
It replaces <em>–haproxy-protocol</em> if used, it is not necessary to specify
both flags.</p>
<p>
If –haproxy-clientip is provided several times, the last set value is
used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --haproxy-clientip $IP
</pre>
<p>
Added in 8.2.0. See also <em>-x, –proxy</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–haproxy-protocol
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Send a HAProxy PROXY protocol v1 header
at the beginning of the connection. This is used by some load
balancers and reverse proxies to indicate the client&#39;s true IP address

</dl>
<p>This option is primarily useful when sending test requests to a service
that expects this header.</p>
<p>
Providing –haproxy-protocol multiple times has no extra effect. Disable
it again with –no-haproxy-protocol.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --haproxy-protocol https://example.com

<p>Providing –head multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it again
with –no-head.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">

<p>
See also <em>-G, –get</em>, <em>-v, –verbose</em> and <em>–trace-ascii</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-H, –header &lt;header/@file&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP IMAP SMTP) Extra header to
include in information sent. When used within an HTTP request, it is
added to the regular request headers.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For an IMAP or SMTP MIME uploaded mail built with <em>-F, –form</em> options,
it is prepended to the resulting MIME document, effectively including it
at the mail global level. It does not affect raw uploaded mails.</p>
<p>
You may specify any number of extra headers. Note that if you should add
a custom header that has the same name as one of the internal ones curl
would use, your externally set header is used instead of the internal
one. This allows you to make even trickier stuff than curl would
normally do. You should not replace internally set headers without
knowing perfectly well what you are doing. Remove an internal header by
giving a replacement without content on the right side of the colon, as
in: -H &#34;Host:&#34;. If you send the custom header with no-value then its
header must be terminated with a semicolon, such as -H
&#34;X-Custom-Header;&#34; to send &#34;X-Custom-Header:&#34;.</p>
<p>
curl makes sure that each header you add/replace is sent with the proper
end-of-line marker, you should thus <strong>not</strong> add that as a part of the
header content: do not add newlines or carriage returns, they only mess
things up for you. curl passes on the verbatim string you give it
without any filter or other safe guards. That includes white space and
control characters.</p>
<p>
This option can take an argument in @filename style, which then adds a
header for each line in the input file. Using @- makes curl read the
header file from stdin.</p>
<p>
Please note that most anti-spam utilities check the presence and value
of several MIME mail headers: these are &#34;From:&#34;, &#34;To:&#34;, &#34;Date:&#34; and
&#34;Subject:&#34; among others and should be added with this option.</p>
<p>
You need <em>–proxy-header</em> to send custom headers intended for an HTTP
proxy.</p>
<p>
Passing on a &#34;Transfer-Encoding: chunked&#34; header when doing an HTTP
request with a request body, makes curl send the data using chunked
encoding.</p>
<p>
<strong>WARNING</strong>: headers set with this option are set in all HTTP requests -
even after redirects are followed, like when told with <em>-L, –location</em>.
This can lead to the header being sent to other hosts than the original
host, so sensitive headers should be used with caution combined with
following redirects.</p>
<p>
–header can be used several times in a command line</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl -H &#34;X-First-Name: Joe&#34; https://example.com
 curl -H &#34;User-Agent: yes-please/2000&#34; https://example.com

</dl>
<p>If curl is told to use HTTP:// for a transfer involving a hostname that

to HTTP/3 when you know that the target speaks HTTP/3 on the given host
and port.</p>
<p>
When asked to use HTTP/3, curl issues a separate attempt to use older
HTTP versions with a slight delay, so if the HTTP/3 transfer fails or is
slow, curl still tries to proceed with an older HTTP version.</p>
<p>
Use <em>–http3-only</em> for similar functionality <em>without</em> a fallback.</p>
<p>
Providing –http3 multiple times has no extra effect.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --http3 https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
<em>–http3</em> requires that libcurl is built to support HTTP/3. This option
is mutually exclusive with <em>–http1.1</em>, <em>–http1.0</em>, <em>–http2</em>,

–http3-only
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Instructs curl to use HTTP/3 to the host in the

</dl>
<p>This option allows a user to avoid using the Alt-Svc method of upgrading

<p>
This option makes curl fail if a QUIC connection cannot be established,
it does not attempt any other HTTP versions on its own. Use <em>–http3</em>
for similar functionality <em>with</em> a fallback.</p>
<p>
Providing –http3-only multiple times has no extra effect.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">

<dt>
–ignore-content-length
</dt>
<dd>(FTP HTTP) For HTTP, Ignore the
Content-Length header. This is particularly useful for servers running
Apache 1.x, which reports incorrect Content-Length for files larger
than 2 gigabytes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For FTP, this makes curl skip the SIZE command to figure out the size
before downloading a file.</p>
<p>
This option does not work for HTTP if libcurl was built to use hyper.</p>
<p>
Providing –ignore-content-length multiple times has no extra effect.
Disable it again with –no-ignore-content-length.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --ignore-content-length https://example.com

<p>
See also <em>–ftp-skip-pasv-ip</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-i, –include
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP FTP) Include response headers in the output.
HTTP response headers can include things like server name, cookies,
date of the document, HTTP version and more… With non-HTTP
protocols, the &#34;headers&#34; are other server communication.</dd>
</dl>
<p>To view the request headers, consider the <em>-v, –verbose</em> option.</p>
<p>
Providing –include multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it again
with –no-include.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl -i https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-v, –verbose</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-k, –insecure
</dt>
<dd>(TLS SFTP SCP) By default, every secure connection
curl makes is verified to be secure before the transfer takes place.
This option makes curl skip the verification step and proceed without
checking.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When this option is not used for protocols using TLS, curl verifies the
server&#39;s TLS certificate before it continues: that the certificate
contains the right name which matches the hostname used in the URL and
that the certificate has been signed by a CA certificate present in the
cert store. See this online resource for further details:
<strong><a href="https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html">https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html</a></strong></p>
<p>
For SFTP and SCP, this option makes curl skip the <em>known_hosts</em>
verification. <em>known_hosts</em> is a file normally stored in the user&#39;s home
directory in the &#34;.ssh&#34; subdirectory, which contains hostnames and their
public keys.</p>
<p>
<strong>WARNING</strong>: using this option makes the transfer insecure.</p>
<p>
When curl uses secure protocols it trusts responses and allows for
example HSTS and Alt-Svc information to be stored and used subsequently.
Using <em>-k, –insecure</em> can make curl trust and use such information from
malicious servers.</p>
<p>
Providing –insecure multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it
again with –no-insecure.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --insecure https://example.com

<dl>
<dt>
–interface &lt;name&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Perform the operation using a specified

you prefer to be specific, you can use the following special syntax:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
if!&lt;name&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Interface name. If the provided name does not match an
existing interface, curl returns with error 45.</dd>
<dt>
host!&lt;name&gt;
</dt>
<dd>IP address or hostname.</dd>
<dt>
ifhost!&lt;interface&gt;!&lt;host&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Interface name and IP address or
hostname. This syntax requires libcurl 8.9.0 or later.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the provided name does not match an existing interface, curl
returns with error 45.</p>
<p>
curl does not support using network interface names for this option on
Windows.</p>
<p>
That name resolve operation if a hostname is provided does <strong>not</strong> use
DNS-over-HTTPS even if <em>–doh-url</em> is set.</p>
<p>
On Linux this option can be used to specify a <strong>VRF</strong> (Virtual Routing
and Forwarding) device, but the binary then needs to either have the
<strong>CAP_NET_RAW</strong> capability set or to be run as root.</p>
<p>
If –interface is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>

<dl>
<dt>
–ipfs-gateway &lt;URL&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(IPFS) Specify which gateway to use for IPFS
and IPNS URLs. Not specifying this instead makes curl check if the
IPFS_GATEWAY environment variable is set, or if a &#34;~/.ipfs/gateway&#34;
file holding the gateway URL exists.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you run a local IPFS node, this gateway is by default available under
&#34;<a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>&#34;. A full example URL would look like:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl --ipfs-gateway http://localhost:8080 ipfs://bafybeigagd5nmnn2iys2f3doro7ydrevyr2mzarwidgadawmamiteydbzi
</pre>
<p>
There are many public IPFS gateways. See for example:
<a href="https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/">https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/</a></p>
<p>
If you opt to go for a remote gateway you need to be aware that you
completely trust the gateway. This might be fine in local gateways that
you host yourself. With remote gateways there could potentially be
malicious actors returning you data that does not match the request you
made, inspect or even interfere with the request. You may not notice
this when using curl. A mitigation could be to go for a &#34;trustless&#34;
gateway. This means you locally verify that the data. Consult the docs
page on trusted vs trustless:
<a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/http/gateway/#trusted-vs-trustless">https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/http/gateway/#trusted-vs-trustless</a></p>

<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">

<dl>
<dt>
–json &lt;data&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Sends the specified JSON data in a POST
request to the HTTP server. <em>–json</em> works as a shortcut for passing
on these three options:</dd>
</dl>
<pre class="example">
--data [arg]
--header &#34;Content-Type: application/json&#34;
--header &#34;Accept: application/json&#34;
</pre>
<p>
There is <strong>no verification</strong> that the passed in data is actual JSON or
that the syntax is correct.</p>
<p>
If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a filename
to read the data from, or a single dash (-) if you want curl to read the
data from stdin. Posting data from a file named &#39;foobar&#39; would thus be
done with <em>–json</em> @foobar and to instead read the data from stdin, use
<em>–json</em> @-.</p>
<p>
If this option is used more than once on the same command line, the
additional data pieces are concatenated to the previous before sending.</p>
<p>
The headers this option sets can be overridden with <em>-H, –header</em> as
usual.</p>
<p>
–json can be used several times in a command line</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --json &#39;{ &#34;drink&#34;: &#34;coffe&#34; }&#39; https://example.com
 curl --json &#39;{ &#34;drink&#34;:&#39; --json &#39; &#34;coffe&#34; }&#39; https://example.com
 curl --json @prepared https://example.com
 curl --json @- https://example.com &lt; json.txt
</pre>
<p>
This option is mutually exclusive with <em>-F, –form</em>, <em>-I, –head</em> and
<em>-T, –upload-file</em>. Added in 7.82.0. See also <em>–data-binary</em> and
<em>–data-raw</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-j, –junk-session-cookies
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies
from a given file, this option makes it discard all &#34;session cookies&#34;.
This has the same effect as if a new session is started. Typical
browsers discard session cookies when they are closed down.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Providing –junk-session-cookies multiple times has no extra effect.
Disable it again with –no-junk-session-cookies.</p>

<dt>
–keepalive-cnt &lt;integer&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Set the maximum number of keepalive
probes TCP should send but get no response before dropping the
connection. This option is usually used in conjunction with
<em>–keepalive-time</em>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This option is supported on Linux, *BSD/macOS, Windows &gt;=10.0.16299,
Solaris 11.4, and recent AIX, HP-UX and more. This option has no effect
if <em>–no-keepalive</em> is used.</p>
<p>
If unspecified, the option defaults to 9.</p>

If –keepalive-cnt is provided several times, the last set value is
used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --keepalive-cnt 3 https://example.com

Added in 8.9.0. See also <em>–keepalive-time</em> and <em>–no-keepalive</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–keepalive-time &lt;seconds&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Set the time a connection needs to
remain idle before sending keepalive probes and the time between
individual keepalive probes. It is currently effective on operating
systems offering the &#34;TCP_KEEPIDLE&#34; and &#34;TCP_KEEPINTVL&#34; socket options
(meaning Linux, *BSD/macOS, Windows, Solaris, and recent AIX, HP-UX
and more). Keepalive is used by the TCP stack to detect broken
networks on idle connections. The number of missed keepalive probes
before declaring the connection down is OS dependent and is commonly 8
(*BSD/macOS/AIX), 9 (Linux/AIX) or 5/10 (Windows), and this number can
be changed by specifying the curl option &#34;keepalive-cnt&#34;. Note that
this option has no effect if <em>–no-keepalive</em> is used.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If unspecified, the option defaults to 60 seconds.</p>
<p>
If –keepalive-time is provided several times, the last set value is

<dl>
<dt>
–key &lt;key&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(TLS SSH) Private key filename. Allows you to provide
your private key in this separate file. For SSH, if not specified,
curl tries the following candidates in order: &#34;~/.ssh/id_rsa&#34;,
&#34;~/.ssh/id_dsa&#34;, &#34;./id_rsa&#34;, &#34;./id_dsa&#34;.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine pkcs11 is
available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be used to specify a
private key located in a PKCS#11 device. A string beginning with
&#34;pkcs11:&#34; is interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI. If a PKCS#11 URI is provided,
then the <em>–engine</em> option is set as &#34;pkcs11&#34; if none was provided and
the <em>–key-type</em> option is set as &#34;ENG&#34; if none was provided.</p>
<p>
If curl is built against Secure Transport or Schannel then this option
is ignored for TLS protocols (HTTPS, etc). Those backends expect the
private key to be already present in the keychain or PKCS#12 file
containing the certificate.</p>
<p>
If –key is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --cert certificate --key here https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–key-type</em> and <em>-E, –cert</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–key-type &lt;type&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(TLS) Private key file type. Specify which type
your <em>–key</em> provided private key is. DER, PEM, and ENG are supported.
If not specified, PEM is assumed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If –key-type is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>

See also <em>–key</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–krb &lt;level&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(FTP) Enable Kerberos authentication and use. The
level must be entered and should be one of &#39;clear&#39;, &#39;safe&#39;,
&#39;confidential&#39;, or &#39;private&#39;. Should you use a level that is not one
of these, &#39;private&#39; is used.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If –krb is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --krb clear ftp://example.com/
</pre>
<p>
<em>–krb</em> requires that libcurl is built to support Kerberos. See also
<em>–delegation</em> and <em>–ssl</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–libcurl &lt;file&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Append this option to any ordinary curl command
line, and you get libcurl-using C source code written to the file that
does the equivalent of what your command-line operation does!</dd>
</dl>
<p>This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of
–next.</p>
<p>
If –libcurl is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --libcurl client.c https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-v, –verbose</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–limit-rate &lt;speed&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Specify the maximum transfer rate you want
curl to use - for both downloads and uploads. This feature is useful
if you have a limited pipe and you would like your transfer not to use
your entire bandwidth. To make it slower than it otherwise would be.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix is
appended. Appending &#39;k&#39; or &#39;K&#39; counts the number as kilobytes, &#39;m&#39; or
&#39;M&#39; makes it megabytes, while &#39;g&#39; or &#39;G&#39; makes it gigabytes. The
suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based. For example 1k is 1024.
Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.</p>
<p>
The rate limiting logic works on averaging the transfer speed to no more
than the set threshold over a period of multiple seconds.</p>
<p>
If you also use the <em>-Y, –speed-limit</em> option, that option takes
precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting slightly, to help keeping
the speed-limit logic working.</p>
<p>
If –limit-rate is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --limit-rate 100K https://example.com
 curl --limit-rate 1000 https://example.com
 curl --limit-rate 10M https://example.com

<dl>
<dt>
-l, –list-only
</dt>
<dd>(FTP POP3 SFTP FILE) When listing an FTP directory,
force a name-only view. Maybe particularly useful if the user wants to
machine-parse the contents of an FTP directory since the normal
directory view does not use a standard look or format. When used like
this, the option causes an NLST command to be sent to the server
instead of LIST.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note: Some FTP servers list only files in their response to NLST; they
do not include sub-directories and symbolic links.</p>
<p>
When listing an SFTP directory, this switch forces a name-only view, one
per line. This is especially useful if the user wants to machine-parse
the contents of an SFTP directory since the normal directory view
provides more information than just filenames.</p>
<p>
When retrieving a specific email from POP3, this switch forces a LIST
command to be performed instead of RETR. This is particularly useful if
the user wants to see if a specific message-id exists on the server and
what size it is.</p>
<p>
For FILE, this option has no effect yet as directories are always listed
in this mode.</p>
<p>
Note: When combined with <em>-X, –request</em>, this option can be used to
send a UIDL command instead, so the user may use the email&#39;s unique
identifier rather than its message-id to make the request.</p>
<p>
Providing –list-only multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it
again with –no-list-only.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --list-only ftp://example.com/dir/
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-Q, –quote</em> and <em>-X, –request</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–local-port &lt;range&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Set a preferred single number or range
(FROM-TO) of local port numbers to use for the connection(s). Note
that port numbers by nature are a scarce resource so setting this
range to something too narrow might cause unnecessary connection setup
failures.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If –local-port is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --local-port 1000-3000 https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-g, –globoff</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-L, –location
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) If the server reports that the requested page
has moved to a different location (indicated with a Location: header
and a 3XX response code), this option makes curl redo the request on
the new place. If used together with <em>-i, –include</em> or <em>-I, –head</em>,
headers from all requested pages are shown.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When authentication is used, curl only sends its credentials to the
initial host. If a redirect takes curl to a different host, it does not
get the user+password pass on. See also <em>–location-trusted</em> on how to
change this.</p>
<p>
Limit the amount of redirects to follow by using the <em>–max-redirs</em>
option.</p>
<p>
When curl follows a redirect and if the request is a POST, it sends the
following request with a GET if the HTTP response was 301, 302, or 303.
If the response code was any other 3xx code, curl resends the following
request using the same unmodified method.</p>
<p>
You can tell curl to not change POST requests to GET after a 30x
response by using the dedicated options for that: <em>–post301</em>,
<em>–post302</em> and <em>–post303</em>.</p>
<p>
The method set with <em>-X, –request</em> overrides the method curl would
otherwise select to use.</p>
<p>
Providing –location multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it
again with –no-location.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl -L https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–resolve</em> and <em>–alt-svc</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–location-trusted
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Like <em>-L, –location</em>, but allows sending
the name + password to all hosts that the site may redirect to. This
may or may not introduce a security breach if the site redirects you
to a site to which you send your authentication info (which is
clear-text in the case of HTTP Basic authentication).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Providing –location-trusted multiple times has no extra effect. Disable
it again with –no-location-trusted.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --location-trusted -u user:password https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-u, –user</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–login-options &lt;options&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(IMAP LDAP POP3 SMTP) Specify the login
options to use during server authentication.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can use login options to specify protocol specific options that may
be used during authentication. At present only IMAP, POP3 and SMTP
support login options. For more information about login options please
see RFC 2384, RFC 5092 and the IETF draft
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-earhart-url-smtp-00">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-earhart-url-smtp-00</a></p>
<p>
Since 8.2.0, IMAP supports the login option &#34;AUTH=+LOGIN&#34;. With this
option, curl uses the plain (not SASL) &#34;LOGIN IMAP&#34; command even if the
server advertises SASL authentication. Care should be taken in using
this option, as it sends your password over the network in plain text.
This does not work if the IMAP server disables the plain &#34;LOGIN&#34; (e.g.
to prevent password snooping).</p>
<p>
If –login-options is provided several times, the last set value is
used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --login-options &#39;AUTH=*&#39; imap://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-u, –user</em>.</p>
<dl>

<dt>
–mail-rcpt &lt;address&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(SMTP) Specify a single email address,
username or mailing list name. Repeat this option several times to
send to multiple recipients.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When performing an address verification (<strong>VRFY</strong> command), the recipient
should be specified as the username or username and domain (as per
Section 3.5 of RFC 5321).</p>
<p>
When performing a mailing list expand (EXPN command), the recipient
should be specified using the mailing list name, such as &#34;Friends&#34; or
&#34;London-Office&#34;.</p>
<p>
–mail-rcpt can be used several times in a command line</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --mail-rcpt user@example.net smtp://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–mail-rcpt-allowfails</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–mail-rcpt-allowfails
</dt>
<dd>(SMTP) When sending data to multiple
recipients, by default curl aborts SMTP conversation if at least one
of the recipients causes RCPT TO command to return an error.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The default behavior can be changed by passing <em>–mail-rcpt-allowfails</em>
command-line option which makes curl ignore errors and proceed with the
remaining valid recipients.</p>
<p>
If all recipients trigger RCPT TO failures and this flag is specified,
curl still aborts the SMTP conversation and returns the error received
from to the last RCPT TO command.</p>
<p>
Providing –mail-rcpt-allowfails multiple times has no extra effect.
Disable it again with –no-mail-rcpt-allowfails.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --mail-rcpt-allowfails --mail-rcpt dest@example.com smtp://example.com

<dt>
–max-filesize &lt;bytes&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(FTP HTTP MQTT) Specify the maximum size (in
bytes) of a file to download. If the file requested is larger than
this value, the transfer does not start and curl returns with exit
code 63.</dd>
</dl>
<p>A size modifier may be used. For example, Appending &#39;k&#39; or &#39;K&#39; counts
the number as kilobytes, &#39;m&#39; or &#39;M&#39; makes it megabytes, while &#39;g&#39; or &#39;G&#39;
makes it gigabytes. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.</p>
<p>
<strong>NOTE</strong>: before curl 8.4.0, when the file size is not known prior to
download, for such files this option has no effect even if the file
transfer ends up being larger than this given limit.</p>
<p>
Starting with curl 8.4.0, this option aborts the transfer if it reaches
the threshold during transfer.</p>
<p>
If –max-filesize is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --max-filesize 100K https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–limit-rate</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–max-redirs &lt;num&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Set maximum number of redirections to
follow. When <em>-L, –location</em> is used, to prevent curl from following
too many redirects, by default, the limit is set to 50 redirects. Set
this option to -1 to make it unlimited.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If –max-redirs is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --max-redirs 3 --location https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-L, –location</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-m, –max-time &lt;seconds&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Set maximum time in seconds that you allow
each transfer to take. Prevents your batch jobs from hanging for hours
due to slow networks or links going down. This option accepts decimal
values.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you enable retrying the transfer (<em>–retry</em>) then the maximum time
counter is reset each time the transfer is retried. You can use
<em>–retry-max-time</em> to limit the retry time.</p>
<p>
The decimal value needs to provided using a dot (.) as decimal
separator - not the local version even if it might be using another
separator.</p>
<p>
If –max-time is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>

resource. Metalink support is disabled in curl for security reasons
(added in 7.78.0).</dd>
</dl>
<p>If –metalink is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>

<p>
See also <em>-Z, –parallel</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–mptcp
</dt>
<dd>Enables the use of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) for connections.
MPTCP is an extension to the standard TCP that allows multiple TCP
streams over different network paths between the same source and
destination. This can enhance bandwidth and improve reliability by
using multiple paths simultaneously.</dd>
</dl>
<p>MPTCP is beneficial in networks where multiple paths exist between
clients and servers, such as mobile networks where a device may switch
between WiFi and cellular data or in wired networks with multiple
Internet Service Providers.</p>
<p>
This option is currently only supported on Linux starting from kernel
5.6. Only TCP connections are modified, hence this option does not
effect HTTP/3 (QUIC) or UDP connections.</p>
<p>
The server curl connects to must also support MPTCP. If not, the
connection seamlessly falls back to TCP.</p>
<p>
Providing –mptcp multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it again
with –no-mptcp.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --mptcp https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
Added in 8.9.0. See also <em>–tcp-fastopen</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–negotiate
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Enable Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This option requires a library built with GSS-API or SSPI support. Use
<em>-V, –version</em> to see if your curl supports GSS-API/SSPI or SPNEGO.</p>
<p>
When using this option, you must also provide a fake <em>-u, –user</em> option
to activate the authentication code properly. Sending a &#39;-u :&#39; is enough
as the username and password from the <em>-u, –user</em> option are not
actually used.</p>
<p>
Providing –negotiate multiple times has no extra effect.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --negotiate -u : https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–basic</em>, <em>–ntlm</em>, <em>–anyauth</em> and <em>–proxy-negotiate</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-n, –netrc
</dt>
<dd>Make curl scan the <em>.netrc</em> file in the user&#39;s home
directory for login name and password. This is typically used for FTP
on Unix. If used with HTTP, curl enables user authentication. See
<em>netrc(5)</em> and <em>ftp(1)</em> for details on the file format. Curl does not
complain if that file does not have the right permissions (it should
be neither world- nor group-readable). The environment variable &#34;HOME&#34;
is used to find the home directory.</dd>
</dl>
<p>On Windows two filenames in the home directory are checked: <em>.netrc</em> and
<em>_netrc</em>, preferring the former. Older versions on Windows checked for
<em>_netrc</em> only.</p>
<p>
A quick and simple example of how to setup a <em>.netrc</em> to allow curl to
FTP to the machine host.domain.com with username &#39;myself&#39; and password
&#39;secret&#39; could look similar to:</p>
<pre class="example">
machine host.domain.com
login myself
password secret
</pre>
<p>
Providing –netrc multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it again
with –no-netrc.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --netrc https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
This option is mutually exclusive with <em>–netrc-file</em> and
<em>–netrc-optional</em>. See also <em>–netrc-file</em>, <em>-K, –config</em> and <em>-u,
–user</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–netrc-file &lt;filename&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Set the netrc file to use. Similar to <em>-n,
–netrc</em>, except that you also provide the path (absolute or
relative).</dd>
</dl>
<p>It abides by <em>–netrc-optional</em> if specified.</p>
<p>
If –netrc-file is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --netrc-file netrc https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
This option is mutually exclusive with <em>-n, –netrc</em>. See also <em>-n,
–netrc</em>, <em>-u, –user</em> and <em>-K, –config</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–netrc-optional
</dt>
<dd>Similar to <em>-n, –netrc</em>, but this option makes
the .netrc usage <strong>optional</strong> and not mandatory as the <em>-n, –netrc</em>
option does.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Providing –netrc-optional multiple times has no extra effect. Disable
it again with –no-netrc-optional.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --netrc-optional https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
This option is mutually exclusive with <em>-n, –netrc</em>. See also
<em>–netrc-file</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-:, –next
</dt>
<dd>Use a separate operation for the following URL and
associated options. This allows you to send several URL requests, each
with their own specific options, for example, such as different
usernames or custom requests for each.</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>-:, –next</em> resets all local options and only global ones have their
values survive over to the operation following the <em>-:, –next</em>
instruction. Global options include <em>-v, –verbose</em>, <em>–trace</em>,
<em>–trace-ascii</em> and <em>–fail-early</em>.</p>
<p>
For example, you can do both a GET and a POST in a single command line:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl www1.example.com --next -d postthis www2.example.com
</pre>
<p>
–next can be used several times in a command line</p>

 curl https://example.com --next -d postthis www2.example.com
 curl -I https://example.com --next https://example.net/

<dl>
<dt>
-N, –no-buffer
</dt>
<dd>Disables the buffering of the output stream. In
normal work situations, curl uses a standard buffered output stream
that has the effect that it outputs the data in chunks, not
necessarily exactly when the data arrives. Using this option disables
that buffering.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that this is the negated option name documented. You can use
<em>–buffer</em> to enable buffering again.</p>
<p>
Providing –no-buffer multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it

–no-clobber
</dt>
<dd>When used in conjunction with the <em>-o, –output</em>, <em>-J,
–remote-header-name</em>, <em>-O, –remote-name</em>, or <em>–remote-name-all</em>
options, curl avoids overwriting files that already exist. Instead, a
dot and a number gets appended to the name of the file that would be
created, up to filename.100 after which it does not create any file.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that this is the negated option name documented. You can thus use
<em>–clobber</em> to enforce the clobbering, even if <em>-J,
–remote-header-name</em> is specified.</p>

<dl>
<dt>
–no-sessionid
</dt>
<dd>(TLS) Disable curl&#39;s use of SSL session-ID caching.
By default all transfers are done using the cache. Note that while
nothing should ever get hurt by attempting to reuse SSL session-IDs,
there seem to be broken SSL implementations in the wild that may
require you to disable this in order for you to succeed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that this is the negated option name documented. You can thus use
<em>–sessionid</em> to enforce session-ID caching.</p>
<p>
Providing –no-sessionid multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it

<dl>
<dt>
–noproxy &lt;no-proxy-list&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Comma-separated list of hosts for which
not to use a proxy, if one is specified. The only wildcard is a single
&#34;*&#34; character, which matches all hosts, and effectively disables the
proxy. Each name in this list is matched as either a domain which
contains the hostname, or the hostname itself. For example,
&#34;local.com&#34; would match &#34;local.com&#34;, &#34;local.com:80&#34;, and
&#34;www.local.com&#34;, but not &#34;www.notlocal.com&#34;.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This option overrides the environment variables that disable the proxy
(&#34;no_proxy&#34; and &#34;NO_PROXY&#34;). If there is an environment variable
disabling a proxy, you can set the no proxy list to &#34;&#34; to override it.</p>
<p>
IP addresses specified to this option can be provided using CIDR
notation (added in 7.86.0): an appended slash and number specifies the
number of network bits out of the address to use in the comparison. For
example &#34;192.168.0.0/16&#34; would match all addresses starting with
&#34;192.168&#34;.</p>
<p>
If –noproxy is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>

<dl>
<dt>
–ntlm
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Use NTLM authentication. The NTLM authentication
method was designed by Microsoft and is used by IIS web servers. It is
a proprietary protocol, reverse-engineered by clever people and
implemented in curl based on their efforts. This kind of behavior
should not be endorsed, you should encourage everyone who uses NTLM to
switch to a public and documented authentication method instead, such
as Digest.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you want to enable NTLM for your proxy authentication, then use
<em>–proxy-ntlm</em>.</p>

<dd>(IMAP LDAP POP3 SMTP HTTP) Specify the
Bearer Token for OAUTH 2.0 server authentication. The Bearer Token is
used in conjunction with the username which can be specified as part
of the <em>–url</em> or <em>-u, –user</em> options.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Bearer Token and username are formatted according to RFC 6750.</p>
<p>
If –oauth2-bearer is provided several times, the last set value is

See also <em>–basic</em>, <em>–ntlm</em> and <em>–digest</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-o, –output &lt;file&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Write output to the given file instead of
stdout. If you are using globbing to fetch multiple documents, you
should quote the URL and you can use &#34;#&#34; followed by a number in the
filename. That variable is then replaced with the current string for
the URL being fetched. Like in:</dd>
</dl>
<pre class="example">
curl &#34;http://{one,two}.example.com&#34; -o &#34;file_#1.txt&#34;
</pre>
<p>
or use several variables like:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl &#34;http://{site,host}.host[1-5].example&#34; -o &#34;#1_#2&#34;
</pre>
<p>
You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you have.
For example, if you specify two URLs on the same command line, you can
use it like this:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl -o aa example.com -o bb example.net
</pre>
<p>
and the order of the -o options and the URLs does not matter, just that
the first -o is for the first URL and so on, so the above command line
can also be written as</p>
<pre class="example">
curl example.com example.net -o aa -o bb
</pre>
<p>
See also the <em>–create-dirs</em> option to create the local directories
dynamically. Specifying the output as &#39;-&#39; (a single dash) passes the
output to stdout.</p>
<p>
To suppress response bodies, you can redirect output to /dev/null:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl example.com -o /dev/null
</pre>
<p>
Or for Windows:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl example.com -o nul
</pre>
<p>
Specify the filename as single minus to force the output to stdout, to
override curl&#39;s internal binary output in terminal prevention:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl https://example.com/jpeg -o -
</pre>
<p>
–output is associated with a single URL. Use it once per URL when you
use several URLs in a command line.</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl -o file https://example.com
 curl &#34;http://{one,two}.example.com&#34; -o &#34;file_#1.txt&#34;
 curl &#34;http://{site,host}.host[1-5].example&#34; -o &#34;#1_#2&#34;

<dt>
–output-dir &lt;dir&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Specify the directory in which files should be
stored, when <em>-O, –remote-name</em> or <em>-o, –output</em> are used.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The given output directory is used for all URLs and output options on
the command line, up until the first <em>-:, –next</em>.</p>
<p>
If the specified target directory does not exist, the operation fails
unless <em>–create-dirs</em> is also used.</p>
<p>
If –output-dir is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --output-dir &#34;tmp&#34; -O https://example.com

<dl>
<dt>
-Z, –parallel
</dt>
<dd>Makes curl perform all transfers in parallel as
compared to the regular serial manner. Parallel transfer means that
curl runs up to N concurrent transfers simultaneously and if there are
more than N transfers to handle, it starts new ones when earlier
transfers finish.</dd>
</dl>
<p>With parallel transfers, the progress meter output is different than
when doing serial transfers, as it then displays the transfer status for
multiple transfers in a single line.</p>
<p>
The maximum amount of concurrent transfers is set with <em>–parallel-max</em>
and it defaults to 50.</p>
<p>
This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of
–next.</p>
<p>
Providing –parallel multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it
again with –no-parallel.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --parallel https://example.com -o file1 https://example.com -o file2

<em>–parallel-max</em> and <em>–parallel-immediate</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–parallel-immediate
</dt>
<dd>When doing parallel transfers, this option
instructs curl to prefer opening up more connections in parallel at
once rather than waiting to see if new transfers can be added as
multiplexed streams on another connection.</dd>
</dl>
<p>By default, without this option set, curl prefers to wait a little and
multiplex new transfers over existing connections. It keeps the number
of connections low at the expense of risking a slightly slower transfer
startup.</p>
<p>
This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of
–next.</p>
<p>
Providing –parallel-immediate multiple times has no extra effect.
Disable it again with –no-parallel-immediate.</p>
<p>

<dl>
<dt>
–parallel-max &lt;num&gt;
</dt>
<dd>When asked to do parallel transfers, using
<em>-Z, –parallel</em>, this option controls the maximum amount of transfers
to do simultaneously.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The default is 50. 300 is the largest supported value.</p>
<p>
This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of
–next.</p>
<p>
If –parallel-max is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --parallel-max 100 -Z https://example.com ftp://example.com/

<dt>
–pass &lt;phrase&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(SSH TLS) Passphrase for the private key.</dd>

<p>If –pass is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">

<dl>
<dt>
–path-as-is
</dt>
<dd>Do not handle sequences of <em>..</em> or <em>.</em> in the given
URL path. Normally curl squashes or merges them according to standards
but with this option set you tell it not to do that.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Providing –path-as-is multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it
again with –no-path-as-is.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --path-as-is https://example.com/../../etc/passwd
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–request-target</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–pinnedpubkey &lt;hashes&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(TLS) Use the specified public key file (or
hashes) to verify the peer. This can be a path to a file which
contains a single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number of
base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by &#39;sha256//&#39; and separated by
&#39;;&#39;.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a certificate
indicating its identity. A public key is extracted from this certificate
and if it does not exactly match the public key provided to this option,
curl aborts the connection before sending or receiving any data.</p>
<p>
This option is independent of option <em>-k, –insecure</em>. If you use both
options together then the peer is still verified by public key.</p>
<p>
PEM/DER support:</p>
<p>
OpenSSL and GnuTLS, wolfSSL, mbedTLS , Secure Transport macOS 10.7+/iOS
10+, Schannel</p>
<p>
sha256 support:</p>
<p>

–post301
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Respect RFC 7231/6.4.2 and do not convert POST
requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirect. The non-RFC

<dl>
<dt>
–preproxy [protocol://]host[:port]
</dt>
<dd>Use the specified SOCKS proxy
before connecting to an HTTP or HTTPS <em>-x, –proxy</em>. In such a case
curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then connects (through
SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy. Hence pre proxy.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The pre proxy string should be specified with a protocol:// prefix to
specify alternative proxy protocols. Use socks4://, socks4a://,
socks5:// or socks5h:// to request the specific SOCKS version to be
used. No protocol specified makes curl default to SOCKS4.</p>
<p>
If the port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is assumed
to be 1080.</p>
<p>
User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are URL
decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special characters such as @
by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.</p>
<p>
If –preproxy is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --preproxy socks5://proxy.example -x http://http.example https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-x, –proxy</em> and <em>–socks5</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-#, –progress-bar
</dt>
<dd>Make curl display transfer progress as a simple
progress bar instead of the standard, more informational, meter.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This progress bar draws a single line of &#39;#&#39; characters across the
screen and shows a percentage if the transfer size is known. For
transfers without a known size, there is a space ship (-<code class="verbatim">o</code>-) that moves
back and forth but only while data is being transferred, with a set of
flying hash sign symbols on top.</p>
<p>
This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of
–next.</p>
<p>
Providing –progress-bar multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it
again with –no-progress-bar.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl -# -O https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–styled-output</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–proto &lt;protocols&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Limit what protocols to allow for transfers.
Protocols are evaluated left to right, are comma separated, and are
each a protocol name or &#39;all&#39;, optionally prefixed by zero or more
modifiers. Available modifiers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permit this protocol in addition to protocols already permitted
(this is the default if no modifier is used).</li>
<li>Deny this protocol, removing it from the list of protocols already
permitted.</li>
<li>= :: Permit only this protocol (ignoring the list already
permitted), though subject to later modification by subsequent
entries in the comma separated list.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: <em>–proto</em> -ftps uses the default protocols, but disables
ftps</p>
<p>
<em>–proto</em> -all,https,+http only enables http and https</p>
<p>
<em>–proto</em> =http,https also only enables http and https</p>
<p>
Unknown and disabled protocols produce a warning. This allows scripts
to safely rely on being able to disable potentially dangerous
protocols, without relying upon support for that protocol being built
into curl to avoid an error.</p>
<p>
This option can be used multiple times, in which case the effect is
the same as concatenating the protocols into one instance of the
option.</p>
<p>
If –proto is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<pre class="example">
 curl --proto =http,https,sftp https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–proto-redir</em> and <em>–proto-default</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–proto-default &lt;protocol&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Use <em>protocol</em> for any provided URL
missing a scheme.</dd>
</dl>
<p>An unknown or unsupported protocol causes error
<em>CURLE_UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL</em>.</p>
<p>
This option does not change the default proxy protocol (http).</p>
<p>
Without this option set, curl guesses protocol based on the hostname,
see <em>–url</em> for details.</p>
<p>
If –proto-default is provided several times, the last set value is
used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --proto-default https ftp.example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–proto</em> and <em>–proto-redir</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–proto-redir &lt;protocols&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Limit what protocols to allow on
redirects. Protocols denied by <em>–proto</em> are not overridden by this
option. See <em>–proto</em> for how protocols are represented.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Example, allow only HTTP and HTTPS on redirect:</p>
<pre class="example">
curl --proto-redir -all,http,https http://example.com
</pre>
<p>
By default curl only allows HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS on redirects
(added in 7.65.2). Specifying <em>all</em> or <em>+all</em> enables all protocols on
redirects, which is not good for security.</p>
<p>
If –proto-redir is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --proto-redir =http,https https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–proto</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-x, –proxy [protocol://]host[:port]
</dt>
<dd>Use the specified proxy.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The proxy string can be specified with a protocol:// prefix. No protocol
specified or http:// it is treated as an HTTP proxy. Use socks4://,
socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to request a specific SOCKS version
to be used.</p>
<p>
Unix domain sockets are supported for socks proxy. Set localhost for the
host part. e.g. socks5h://localhost/path/to/socket.sock</p>
<p>
HTTPS proxy support works set with the https:// protocol prefix for
OpenSSL and GnuTLS. It also works for BearSSL, mbedTLS, rustls,
Schannel, Secure Transport and wolfSSL (added in 7.87.0).</p>
<p>
Unrecognized and unsupported proxy protocols cause an error. Ancient
curl versions ignored unknown schemes and used http:// instead.</p>
<p>
If the port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is assumed
to be 1080.</p>
<p>
This option overrides existing environment variables that set the proxy
to use. If there is an environment variable setting a proxy, you can set
proxy to &#34;&#34; to override it.</p>
<p>
All operations that are performed over an HTTP proxy are transparently
converted to HTTP. It means that certain protocol specific operations
might not be available. This is not the case if you can tunnel through
the proxy, as one with the <em>-p, –proxytunnel</em> option.</p>
<p>
User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are URL
decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special characters such as @
by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.</p>
<p>
The proxy host can be specified the same way as the proxy environment
variables, including the protocol prefix (<a href="http://)">http://)</a> and the embedded user</p>
<ul>
<li>password.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a proxy is used, the active FTP mode as set with <em>-P, –ftp-port</em>,
cannot be used.</p>
<p>
If –proxy is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>

<dl>
<dt>
–proxy-anyauth
</dt>
<dd>Automatically pick a suitable authentication method
when communicating with the given HTTP proxy. This might cause an
extra request/response round-trip.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Providing –proxy-anyauth multiple times has no extra effect.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --proxy-anyauth --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-x, –proxy</em>, <em>–proxy-basic</em> and <em>–proxy-digest</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–proxy-basic
</dt>
<dd>Use HTTP Basic authentication when communicating with
the given proxy. Use <em>–basic</em> for enabling HTTP Basic with a remote
host. Basic is the default authentication method curl uses with
proxies.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Providing –proxy-basic multiple times has no extra effect.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --proxy-basic --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-x, –proxy</em>, <em>–proxy-anyauth</em> and <em>–proxy-digest</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–proxy-ca-native
</dt>
<dd>(TLS) Use the CA store from the native operating
system to verify the HTTPS proxy. By default, curl uses a CA store
provided in a single file or directory, but when using this option it
interfaces the operating system&#39;s own vault.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This option works for curl on Windows when built to use OpenSSL, wolfSSL
(added in 8.3.0) or GnuTLS (added in 8.5.0). When curl on Windows is
built to use Schannel, this feature is implied and curl then only uses
the native CA store.</p>
<p>
Providing –proxy-ca-native multiple times has no extra effect. Disable
it again with –no-proxy-ca-native.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --proxy-ca-native https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
Added in 8.2.0. See also <em>–cacert</em>, <em>–capath</em> and <em>-k, –insecure</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–proxy-cacert &lt;file&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Use the specified certificate file to verify
the HTTPS proxy. The file may contain multiple CA certificates. The
certificate(s) must be in PEM format.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This allows you to use a different trust for the proxy compared to the
remote server connected to via the proxy.</p>
<p>
Equivalent to <em>–cacert</em> but used in HTTPS proxy context.</p>
<p>
If –proxy-cacert is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --proxy-cacert CA-file.txt -x https://proxy https://example.com

<dl>
<dt>
–proxy-capath &lt;dir&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Same as <em>–capath</em> but used in HTTPS proxy
context.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Use the specified certificate directory to verify the proxy. Multiple
paths can be provided by separated with colon (&#34;:&#34;) (e.g.
&#34;path1:path2:path3&#34;). The certificates must be in PEM format, and if
curl is built against OpenSSL, the directory must have been processed
using the c_rehash utility supplied with OpenSSL. Using <em>–proxy-capath</em>
can allow OpenSSL-powered curl to make SSL-connections much more
efficiently than using <em>–proxy-cacert</em> if the <em>–proxy-cacert</em> file
contains many CA certificates.</p>
<p>
If this option is set, the default capath value is ignored.</p>
<p>
If –proxy-capath is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --proxy-capath /local/directory -x https://proxy https://example.com

<dl>
<dt>
–proxy-cert &lt;cert[:passwd]&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Use the specified client certificate
file when communicating with an HTTPS proxy. The certificate must be
in PKCS#12 format if using Secure Transport, or PEM format if using
any other engine. If the optional password is not specified, it is
queried for on the terminal. Use <em>–proxy-key</em> to provide the private
key.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This option is the equivalent to <em>-E, –cert</em> but used in HTTPS proxy

–proxy-cert-type &lt;type&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Set type of the provided client
certificate when using HTTPS proxy. PEM, DER, ENG and P12 are
recognized types.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The default type depends on the TLS backend and is usually PEM, however
for Secure Transport and Schannel it is P12. If <em>–proxy-cert</em> is a
pkcs11: URI then ENG is the default type.</p>
<p>
Equivalent to <em>–cert-type</em> but used in HTTPS proxy context.</p>
<p>
If –proxy-cert-type is provided several times, the last set value is
used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">

<dl>
<dt>
–proxy-digest
</dt>
<dd>Use HTTP Digest authentication when communicating

remote host.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Providing –proxy-digest multiple times has no extra effect.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --proxy-digest --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

See also <em>-x, –proxy</em>, <em>–proxy-anyauth</em> and <em>–proxy-basic</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–proxy-header &lt;header/@file&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Extra header to include in the
request when sending HTTP to a proxy. You may specify any number of
extra headers. This is the equivalent option to <em>-H, –header</em> but is
for proxy communication only like in CONNECT requests when you want a
separate header sent to the proxy to what is sent to the actual remote
host.</dd>
</dl>
<p>curl makes sure that each header you add/replace is sent with the proper
end-of-line marker, you should thus <strong>not</strong> add that as a part of the
header content: do not add newlines or carriage returns, they only mess
things up for you.</p>
<p>
Headers specified with this option are not included in requests that
curl knows are not be sent to a proxy.</p>
<p>
This option can take an argument in @filename style, which then adds a
header for each line in the input file. Using @- makes curl read the
headers from stdin.</p>
<p>
This option can be used multiple times to add/replace/remove multiple
headers.</p>
<p>
–proxy-header can be used several times in a command line</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --proxy-header &#34;X-First-Name: Joe&#34; -x http://proxy https://example.com
 curl --proxy-header &#34;User-Agent: surprise&#34; -x http://proxy https://example.com

<dl>
<dt>
–proxy-http2
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Negotiate HTTP/2 with an HTTPS proxy. The
proxy might still only offer HTTP/1 and then curl sticks to using that
version.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This has no effect for any other kinds of proxies.</p>
<p>
Providing –proxy-http2 multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it
again with –no-proxy-http2.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --proxy-http2 -x proxy https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
<em>–proxy-http2</em> requires that libcurl is built to support HTTP/2. Added
in 8.1.0. See also <em>-x, –proxy</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–proxy-insecure
</dt>
<dd>Same as <em>-k, –insecure</em> but used in HTTPS proxy
context.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Every secure connection curl makes is verified to be secure before the
transfer takes place. This option makes curl skip the verification step
with a proxy and proceed without checking.</p>
<p>
When this option is not used for a proxy using HTTPS, curl verifies the
proxy&#39;s TLS certificate before it continues: that the certificate
contains the right name which matches the hostname and that the
certificate has been signed by a CA certificate present in the cert
store. See this online resource for further details:
<strong><a href="https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html">https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html</a></strong></p>
<p>
<strong>WARNING</strong>: using this option makes the transfer to the proxy insecure.</p>
<p>
Providing –proxy-insecure multiple times has no extra effect. Disable
it again with –no-proxy-insecure.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">

–proxy-ssl-allow-beast
</dt>
<dd>Do not work around a security flaw in the
TLS1.0 protocol known as BEAST when communicating to an HTTPS proxy.
If this option is not used, the TLS layer may use workarounds known to
cause interoperability problems with some older server

</dl>
<p>This option only changes how curl does TLS 1.0 with an HTTPS proxy and
has no effect on later TLS versions.</p>
<p>
<strong>WARNING</strong>: this option loosens the TLS security, and by using this flag
you ask for exactly that.</p>
<p>
Equivalent to <em>–ssl-allow-beast</em> but used in HTTPS proxy context.</p>

<dd>Use at least TLS version 1.x when negotiating with an
HTTPS proxy. That means TLS version 1.0 or higher</dd>
</dl>
<p>Equivalent to <em>-1, –tlsv1</em> but for an HTTPS proxy context.</p>
<p>
Providing –proxy-tlsv1 multiple times has no extra effect.</p>

Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --proxy-tlsv1 -x https://proxy https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-x, –proxy</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-U, –proxy-user &lt;user:password&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Specify the username and password
to use for proxy authentication.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and do either Negotiate or
NTLM authentication then you can tell curl to select the username and
password from your environment by specifying a single colon with this
option: &#34;-U :&#34;.</p>
<p>
On systems where it works, curl hides the given option argument from
process listings. This is not enough to protect credentials from
possibly getting seen by other users on the same system as they still
are visible for a moment before cleared. Such sensitive data should be
retrieved from a file instead or similar and never used in clear text in
a command line.</p>
<p>
If –proxy-user is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --proxy-user smith:secret -x proxy https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–proxy-pass</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–proxy1.0 &lt;host[:port]&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Use the specified HTTP 1.0 proxy. If the
port number is not specified, it is assumed at port 1080.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The only difference between this and the HTTP proxy option <em>-x,
–proxy</em>, is that attempts to use CONNECT through the proxy specifies an
HTTP 1.0 protocol instead of the default HTTP 1.1.</p>
<p>
Providing –proxy1.0 multiple times has no extra effect.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --proxy1.0 http://proxy https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-x, –proxy</em>, <em>–socks5</em> and <em>–preproxy</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-p, –proxytunnel
</dt>
<dd>When an HTTP proxy is used <em>-x, –proxy</em>, this
option makes curl tunnel the traffic through the proxy. The tunnel
approach is made with the HTTP proxy CONNECT request and requires that
the proxy allows direct connect to the remote port number curl wants
to tunnel through to.</dd>
</dl>
<p>To suppress proxy CONNECT response headers when curl is set to output
headers use <em>–suppress-connect-headers</em>.</p>
<p>
Providing –proxytunnel multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it

<dl>
<dt>
–pubkey &lt;key&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(SFTP SCP) Public key filename. Allows you to
provide your public key in this separate file.</dd>
</dl>
<p>curl attempts to automatically extract the public key from the private
key file, so passing this option is generally not required. Note that
this public key extraction requires libcurl to be linked against a copy
of libssh2 1.2.8 or higher that is itself linked against OpenSSL.</p>
<p>
If –pubkey is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --pubkey file.pub sftp://example.com/
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–pass</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-Q, –quote &lt;command&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(FTP SFTP) Send an arbitrary command to the
remote FTP or SFTP server. Quote commands are sent BEFORE the transfer
takes place (just after the initial <strong>PWD</strong> command in an FTP transfer,
to be exact). To make commands take place after a successful transfer,
prefix them with a dash &#39;-&#39;.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(FTP only) To make commands be sent after curl has changed the working
directory, just before the file transfer command(s), prefix the command
with a &#39;+&#39;. This is not performed when a directory listing is performed.</p>
<p>
You may specify any number of commands.</p>
<p>
By default curl stops at first failure. To make curl continue even if
the command fails, prefix the command with an asterisk (*). Otherwise,
if the server returns failure for one of the commands, the entire
operation is aborted.</p>
<p>
You must send syntactically correct FTP commands as RFC 959 defines to
FTP servers, or one of the commands listed below to SFTP servers.</p>
<p>
SFTP is a binary protocol. Unlike for FTP, curl interprets SFTP quote
commands itself before sending them to the server. Filenames may be
quoted shell-style to embed spaces or special characters. Following is
the list of all supported SFTP quote commands:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
atime date file
</dt>
<dd>The atime command sets the last access time of the
file named by the file operand. The date expression can be all sorts
of date strings, see the <em>curl_getdate(3)</em> man page for date
expression details. (Added in 7.73.0)</dd>
<dt>
chgrp group file
</dt>
<dd>The chgrp command sets the group ID of the file
named by the file operand to the group ID specified by the group
operand. The group operand is a decimal integer group ID.</dd>
<dt>
chmod mode file
</dt>
<dd>The chmod command modifies the file mode bits of
the specified file. The mode operand is an octal integer mode number.</dd>
<dt>
chown user file
</dt>
<dd>The chown command sets the owner of the file named
by the file operand to the user ID specified by the user operand. The
user operand is a decimal integer user ID.</dd>
<dt>
ln source_file target_file
</dt>
<dd>The ln and symlink commands create a
symbolic link at the target_file location pointing to the source_file
location.</dd>
<dt>
mkdir directory_name
</dt>
<dd>The mkdir command creates the directory named
by the directory_name operand.</dd>
<dt>
mtime date file
</dt>
<dd>The mtime command sets the last modification time
of the file named by the file operand. The date expression can be all
sorts of date strings, see the <em>curl_getdate(3)</em> man page for date
expression details. (Added in 7.73.0)</dd>
<dt>
pwd
</dt>
<dd>The pwd command returns the absolute path name of the current
working directory.</dd>
<dt>
rename source target
</dt>
<dd>The rename command renames the file or
directory named by the source operand to the destination path named by
the target operand.</dd>
<dt>
rm file
</dt>
<dd>The rm command removes the file specified by the file
operand.</dd>
<dt>
rmdir directory
</dt>
<dd>The rmdir command removes the directory entry
specified by the directory operand, provided it is empty.</dd>
<dt>
symlink source_file target_file
</dt>
<dd>See ln.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
–quote can be used several times in a command line</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --quote &#34;DELE file&#34; ftp://example.com/foo
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-X, –request</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–random-file &lt;file&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Deprecated option. This option is ignored
(added in 7.84.0). Prior to that it only had an effect on curl if
built to use old versions of OpenSSL.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specify the path name to file containing random data. The data may be
used to seed the random engine for SSL connections.</p>
<p>
If –random-file is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --random-file rubbish https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–egd-file</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-r, –range &lt;range&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>(HTTP FTP SFTP FILE) Retrieve a byte range
(i.e. a partial document) from an HTTP/1.1, FTP or SFTP server or a
local FILE. Ranges can be specified in a number of ways.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
0-499
</dt>
<dd>specifies the first 500 bytes</dd>
<dt>
500-999
</dt>
<dd>specifies the second 500 bytes</dd>
<dt>
-500
</dt>
<dd>specifies the last 500 bytes</dd>
<dt>
9500-
</dt>
<dd>specifies the bytes from offset 9500 and forward</dd>
<dt>
0-0,-1
</dt>
<dd>specifies the first and last byte only(*)(HTTP)</dd>
<dt>
100-199,500-599
</dt>
<dd>specifies two separate 100-byte ranges(*) (HTTP)</dd>
</dl>
<p>(*) = NOTE that these make the server reply with a multipart response,
which is returned as-is by curl! Parsing or otherwise transforming
this response is the responsibility of the caller.</p>
<p>
Only digit characters (0-9) are valid in the &#39;start&#39; and &#39;stop&#39; fields
of the &#39;start-stop&#39; range syntax. If a non-digit character is given in
the range, the server&#39;s response is unspecified, depending on the
server&#39;s configuration.</p>
<p>
Many HTTP/1.1 servers do not have this feature enabled, so that when
you attempt to get a range, curl instead gets the whole document.</p>
<p>
FTP and SFTP range downloads only support the simple &#39;start-stop&#39;
syntax (optionally with one of the numbers omitted). FTP use depends
on the extended FTP command SIZE.</p>
<p>
If –range is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<pre class="example">
 curl --range 22-44 https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-C, –continue-at</em> and <em>-a, –append</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–rate &lt;max request rate&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Specify the maximum transfer frequency
you allow curl to use - in number of transfer starts per time unit
(sometimes called request rate). Without this option, curl starts the
next transfer as fast as possible.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If given several URLs and a transfer completes faster than the allowed
rate, curl waits until the next transfer is started to maintain the
requested rate. This option has no effect when <em>-Z, –parallel</em> is used.</p>
<p>
The request rate is provided as &#34;N/U&#34; where N is an integer number and U
is a time unit. Supported units are &#39;s&#39; (second), &#39;m&#39; (minute), &#39;h&#39;
(hour) and &#39;d&#39; /(day, as in a 24 hour unit). The default time unit, if
no &#34;/U&#34; is provided, is number of transfers per hour.</p>
<p>
If curl is told to allow 10 requests per minute, it does not start the
next request until 6 seconds have elapsed since the previous transfer
was started.</p>
<p>
This function uses millisecond resolution. If the allowed frequency is
set more than 1000 per second, it instead runs unrestricted.</p>
<p>
When retrying transfers, enabled with <em>–retry</em>, the separate retry
delay logic is used and not this setting.</p>
<p>
This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of
–next.</p>
<p>
If –rate is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --rate 2/s https://example.com ...
 curl --rate 3/h https://example.com ...
 curl --rate 14/m https://example.com ...
</pre>
<p>
Added in 7.84.0. See also <em>–limit-rate</em> and <em>–retry-delay</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–raw
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) When used, it disables all internal HTTP decoding of
content or transfer encodings and instead makes them passed on
unaltered, raw.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Providing –raw multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it again
with –no-raw.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --raw https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–tr-encoding</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-e, –referer &lt;URL&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Set the referrer URL in the HTTP
request. This can also be set with the <em>-H, –header</em> flag of course.
When used with <em>-L, –location</em> you can append &#34;;auto&#34;&#34; to the <em>-e,
–referer</em> URL to make curl automatically set the previous URL when it
follows a Location: header. The &#34;;auto&#34; string can be used alone, even
if you do not set an initial <em>-e, –referer</em>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If –referer is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --referer &#34;https://fake.example&#34; https://example.com
 curl --referer &#34;https://fake.example;auto&#34; -L https://example.com
 curl --referer &#34;;auto&#34; -L https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-A, –user-agent</em> and <em>-H, –header</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-J, –remote-header-name
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Tell the <em>-O, –remote-name</em> option
to use the server-specified Content-Disposition filename instead of
extracting a filename from the URL. If the server-provided filename
contains a path, that is stripped off before the filename is used.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The file is saved in the current directory, or in the directory
specified with <em>–output-dir</em>.</p>
<p>
If the server specifies a filename and a file with that name already
exists in the destination directory, it is not overwritten and an error
occurs - unless you allow it by using the <em>–clobber</em> option. If the
server does not specify a filename then this option has no effect.</p>
<p>
There is no attempt to decode %-sequences (yet) in the provided
filename, so this option may provide you with rather unexpected
filenames.</p>
<p>
This feature uses the name from the &#34;filename&#34; field, it does not yet
support the &#34;filename*&#34; field (filenames with explicit character sets).</p>
<p>
<strong>WARNING</strong>: Exercise judicious use of this option, especially on Windows.
A rogue server could send you the name of a DLL or other file that could
be loaded automatically by Windows or some third party software.</p>
<p>
Providing –remote-header-name multiple times has no extra effect.
Disable it again with –no-remote-header-name.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl -OJ https://example.com/file
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-O, –remote-name</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-O, –remote-name
</dt>
<dd>Write output to a local file named like the
remote file we get. (Only the file part of the remote file is used,
the path is cut off.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The file is saved in the current working directory. If you want the file
saved in a different directory, make sure you change the current working
directory before invoking curl with this option or use <em>–output-dir</em>.</p>
<p>
The remote filename to use for saving is extracted from the given URL,
nothing else, and if it already exists it is overwritten. If you want
the server to be able to choose the filename refer to <em>-J,
–remote-header-name</em> which can be used in addition to this option. If
the server chooses a filename and that name already exists it is not
overwritten.</p>
<p>
There is no URL decoding done on the filename. If it has %20 or other
URL encoded parts of the name, they end up as-is as filename.</p>
<p>
You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you have.</p>
<p>
–remote-name is associated with a single URL. Use it once per URL when
you use several URLs in a command line.</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl -O https://example.com/filename
 curl -O https://example.com/filename -O https://example.com/file2

<dl>
<dt>
–remote-name-all
</dt>
<dd>Change the default action for all given URLs to
be dealt with as if <em>-O, –remote-name</em> were used for each one. If you
want to disable that for a specific URL after <em>–remote-name-all</em> has
been used, you must use &#34;-o -&#34; or <em>–no-remote-name</em>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Providing –remote-name-all multiple times has no extra effect. Disable
it again with –no-remote-name-all.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --remote-name-all ftp://example.com/file1 ftp://example.com/file2
</pre>

-R, –remote-time
</dt>
<dd>Makes curl attempt to figure out the timestamp of

make the local file get that same timestamp.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Providing –remote-time multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it
again with –no-remote-time.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --remote-time -o foo https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-O, –remote-name</em> and <em>-z, –time-cond</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–remove-on-error
</dt>
<dd>Remove output file if an error occurs. If curl
returns an error when told to save output in a local file. This
prevents curl from leaving a partial file in the case of an error
during transfer.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the output is not a regular file, this option has no effect.</p>

<p>Normally you do not need this option. All sorts of <em>GET</em>, <em>HEAD</em>, <em>POST</em>

options.</p>
<p>
This option only changes the actual word used in the HTTP request, it
does not alter the way curl behaves. For example if you want to make a
proper HEAD request, using -X HEAD does not suffice. You need to use the
<em>-I, –head</em> option.</p>
<p>
The method string you set with <em>-X, –request</em> is used for all requests,
which if you for example use <em>-L, –location</em> may cause unintended
side-effects when curl does not change request method according to the
HTTP 30x response codes - and similar.</p>

If –request is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>

–request-target &lt;path&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Use an alternative target (path)
instead of using the path as provided in the URL. Particularly useful
when wanting to issue HTTP requests without leading slash or other
data that does not follow the regular URL pattern, like &#34;OPTIONS *&#34;.</dd>
</dl>
<p>curl passes on the verbatim string you give it its the request without
any filter or other safe guards. That includes white space and control
characters.</p>
<p>
If –request-target is provided several times, the last set value is
used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --request-target &#34;*&#34; -X OPTIONS https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-X, –request</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–resolve &lt;[+]host:port:addr[,addr]…&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Provide a custom address
for a specific host and port pair. Using this, you can make the curl
requests(s) use a specified address and prevent the otherwise normally
resolved address to be used. Consider it a sort of /etc/hosts
alternative provided on the command line. The port number should be
the number used for the specific protocol the host is used for. It
means you need several entries if you want to provide address for the
same host but different ports.</dd>
</dl>
<p>By specifying &#34;*&#34; as host you can tell curl to resolve any host and
specific port pair to the specified address. Wildcard is resolved last
so any <em>–resolve</em> with a specific host and port is used first.</p>
<p>
The provided address set by this option is used even if <em>-4, –ipv4</em> or
<em>-6, –ipv6</em> is set to make curl use another IP version.</p>
<p>
By prefixing the host with a &#39;+&#39; you can make the entry time out after
curl&#39;s default timeout (1 minute). Note that this only makes sense for
long running parallel transfers with a lot of files. In such cases, if
this option is used curl tries to resolve the host as it normally would
once the timeout has expired.</p>
<p>
To redirect connects from a specific hostname or any hostname,
independently of port number, consider the <em>–connect-to</em> option.</p>
<p>
Support for resolving with wildcard was added in 7.64.0.</p>
<p>
Support for the &#39;+&#39; prefix was added in 7.75.0.</p>
<p>
–resolve can be used several times in a command line</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">

<dl>
<dt>
–retry &lt;num&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If a transient error is returned when curl tries to
perform a transfer, it retries this number of times before giving up.
Setting the number to 0 makes curl do no retries (which is the
default). Transient error means either: a timeout, an FTP 4xx response
code or an HTTP 408, 429, 500, 502, 503 or 504 response code.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When curl is about to retry a transfer, it first waits one second and
then for all forthcoming retries it doubles the waiting time until it
reaches 10 minutes which then remains delay between the rest of the
retries. By using <em>–retry-delay</em> you disable this exponential backoff
algorithm. See also <em>–retry-max-time</em> to limit the total time allowed
for retries.</p>
<p>
curl complies with the Retry-After: response header if one was present
to know when to issue the next retry (added in 7.66.0).</p>
<p>
If –retry is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --retry 7 https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>–retry-max-time</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–retry-all-errors
</dt>
<dd>Retry on any error. This option is used together
with <em>–retry</em>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This option is the &#34;sledgehammer&#34; of retrying. Do not use this option by
default (for example in your <strong>curlrc</strong>), there may be unintended
consequences such as sending or receiving duplicate data. Do not use
with redirected input or output. You might be better off handling your
unique problems in a shell script. Please read the example below.</p>
<p>
<strong>WARNING</strong>: For server compatibility curl attempts to retry failed flaky
transfers as close as possible to how they were started, but this is not
possible with redirected input or output. For example, before retrying
it removes output data from a failed partial transfer that was written
to an output file. However this is not true of data redirected to a |
pipe or &gt; file, which are not reset. We strongly suggest you do not
parse or record output via redirect in combination with this option,
since you may receive duplicate data.</p>
<p>
By default curl does not return error for transfers with an HTTP
response code that indicates an HTTP error, if the transfer was
successful. For example, if a server replies 404 Not Found and the reply
is fully received then that is not an error. When <em>–retry</em> is used then
curl retries on some HTTP response codes that indicate transient HTTP
errors, but that does not include most 4xx response codes such as 404.
If you want to retry on all response codes that indicate HTTP errors
(4xx and 5xx) then combine with <em>-f, –fail</em>.</p>
<p>
Providing –retry-all-errors multiple times has no extra effect. Disable
it again with –no-retry-all-errors.</p>

-z, –time-cond &lt;time&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP FTP) Request a file that has been
modified later than the given time and date, or one that has been
modified before that time. The date expression can be all sorts of
date strings or if it does not match any internal ones, it is treated
as a filename and curl tries to get the modification date (mtime) from
that file instead. See the <em>curl_getdate(3)</em> man pages for date
expression details.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Start the date expression with a dash (-) to make it request for a

<dl>
<dt>
-T, –upload-file &lt;file&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Upload the specified local file to the
remote URL.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If there is no file part in the specified URL, curl appends the local
file name to the end of the URL before the operation starts. You must
use a trailing slash (/) on the last directory to prove to curl that
there is no filename or curl thinks that your last directory name is the
remote filename to use.</p>
<p>
When putting the local filename at the end of the URL, curl ignores what
is on the left side of any slash (/) or backslash (\) used in the
filename and only appends what is on the right side of the rightmost
such character.</p>
<p>
Use the filename &#34;-&#34; (a single dash) to use stdin instead of a given
file. Alternately, the filename &#34;.&#34; (a single period) may be specified
instead of &#34;-&#34; to use stdin in non-blocking mode to allow reading server
output while stdin is being uploaded.</p>
<p>
If this option is used with an HTTP(S) URL, the PUT method is used.</p>
<p>
You can specify one <em>-T, –upload-file</em> for each URL on the command
line. Each <em>-T, –upload-file</em> + URL pair specifies what to upload and
to where. curl also supports globbing of the <em>-T, –upload-file</em>
argument, meaning that you can upload multiple files to a single URL by
using the same URL globbing style supported in the URL.</p>
<p>
When uploading to an SMTP server: the uploaded data is assumed to be RFC
5322 formatted. It has to feature the necessary set of headers and mail
body formatted correctly by the user as curl does not transcode nor
encode it further in any way.</p>
<p>
–upload-file is associated with a single URL. Use it once per URL when
you use several URLs in a command line.</p>
<p>
Examples:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl -T file https://example.com
 curl -T &#34;img[1-1000].png&#34; ftp://ftp.example.com/
 curl --upload-file &#34;{file1,file2}&#34; https://example.com

</dt>
<dd>Specify a URL to fetch.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the given URL is missing a scheme name (such as &#34;http://&#34; or &#34;ftp://&#34;
etc) then curl makes a guess based on the host. If the outermost
subdomain name matches DICT, FTP, IMAP, LDAP, POP3 or SMTP then that
protocol is used, otherwise HTTP is used. Guessing can be avoided by
providing a full URL including the scheme, or disabled by setting a
default protocol, see <em>–proto-default</em> for details.</p>
<p>
To control where this URL is written, use the <em>-o, –output</em> or the <em>-O,

it impossible to use a colon in the username with this option. The
password can, still.</p>
<p>
On systems where it works, curl hides the given option argument from
process listings. This is not enough to protect credentials from
possibly getting seen by other users on the same system as they still
are visible for a moment before cleared. Such sensitive data should be
retrieved from a file instead or similar and never used in clear text in
a command line.</p>
<p>
When using Kerberos V5 with a Windows based server you should include
the Windows domain name in the username, in order for the server to
successfully obtain a Kerberos Ticket. If you do not, then the initial
authentication handshake may fail.</p>
<p>
When using NTLM, the username can be specified simply as the username,
without the domain, if there is a single domain and forest in your setup
for example.</p>
<p>
To specify the domain name use either Down-Level Logon Name or UPN (User
Principal Name) formats. For example, EXAMPLE\user and user@example.com
respectively.</p>
<p>
If you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and perform Kerberos V5,
Negotiate, NTLM or Digest authentication then you can tell curl to
select the username and password from your environment by specifying a
single colon with this option: &#34;-u :&#34;.</p>
<p>
If –user is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl -u user:secret https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-n, –netrc</em> and <em>-K, –config</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-A, –user-agent &lt;name&gt;
</dt>
<dd>(HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to
send to the HTTP server. To encode blanks in the string, surround the
string with single quote marks. This header can also be set with the
<em>-H, –header</em> or the <em>–proxy-header</em> options.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you give an empty argument to <em>-A, –user-agent</em> (&#34;&#34;), it removes the
header completely from the request. If you prefer a blank header, you
can set it to a single space (&#34; &#34;).</p>
<p>
If –user-agent is provided several times, the last set value is used.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl -A &#34;Agent 007&#34; https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
See also <em>-H, –header</em> and <em>–proxy-header</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–variable &lt;[%]name=text/@file&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Set a variable with &#34;name=content&#34;
or &#34;name@file&#34; (where &#34;file&#34; can be stdin if set to a single dash
(&#34;-&#34;)). The name is a case sensitive identifier that must consist of
no other letters than a-z, A-Z, 0-9 or underscore. The specified
content is then associated with this identifier.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Setting the same variable name again overwrites the old contents with
the new.</p>
<p>
The contents of a variable can be referenced in a later command line
option when that option name is prefixed with &#34;<em>–expand-</em>&#34;, and the
name is used as &#34;{{name}}&#34;.</p>
<p>
<em>–variable</em> can import environment variables into the name space. Opt
to either require the environment variable to be set or provide a
default value for the variable in case it is not already set.</p>
<p>
<em>–variable</em> %name imports the variable called &#34;name&#34; but exits with an
error if that environment variable is not already set. To provide a
default value if the environment variable is not set, use <em>–variable</em>
%name=content or <em>–variable</em> %name@content. Note that on some systems -
but not all - environment variables are case insensitive.</p>
<p>
When expanding variables, curl supports a set of functions that can make
the variable contents more convenient to use. You apply a function to a
variable expansion by adding a colon and then list the desired functions
in a comma-separated list that is evaluated in a left-to-right order.
Variable content holding null bytes that are not encoded when expanded,
causes an error.</p>
<p>
Available functions:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
trim
</dt>
<dd>removes all leading and trailing white space.</dd>
<dt>
json
</dt>
<dd>outputs the content using JSON string quoting rules.</dd>
<dt>
url
</dt>
<dd>shows the content URL (percent) encoded.</dd>
<dt>
b64
</dt>
<dd>expands the variable base64 encoded</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
–variable can be used several times in a command line</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --variable name=smith --expand-url &#34;https://example.com/{{name}}&#34;
</pre>
<p>
Added in 8.3.0. See also <em>-K, –config</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-v, –verbose
</dt>
<dd>Makes curl verbose during the operation. Useful for
debugging and seeing what&#39;s going on under the hood. A line starting
with &gt; means header data sent by curl, &lt; means header data received by
curl that is hidden in normal cases, and a line starting with * means
additional info provided by curl.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you only want HTTP headers in the output, <em>-i, –include</em> or <em>-D,
–dump-header</em> might be more suitable options.</p>
<p>
If you think this option still does not give you enough details,
consider using <em>–trace</em> or <em>–trace-ascii</em> instead.</p>
<p>
Note that verbose output of curl activities and network traffic might
contain sensitive data, including usernames, credentials or secret data
content. Be aware and be careful when sharing trace logs with others.</p>
<p>
This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of
–next.</p>
<p>
Providing –verbose multiple times has no extra effect. Disable it again
with –no-verbose.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 curl --verbose https://example.com
</pre>
<p>
This option is mutually exclusive with <em>–trace</em> and <em>–trace-ascii</em>.
See also <em>-i, –include</em>, <em>-s, –silent</em>, <em>–trace</em> and <em>–trace-ascii</em>.</p>

<p>
Added in 8.9.0. See also <em>–ip-tos</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-w, –write-out &lt;format&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Make curl display information on stdout
after a completed transfer. The format is a string that may contain
plain text mixed with any number of variables. The format can be
specified as a literal &#34;string&#34;, or you can have curl read the format
from a file with &#34;@filename&#34; and to tell curl to read the format from
stdin you write &#34;@-&#34;.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The variables present in the output format are substituted by the value
or text that curl thinks fit, as described below. All variables are
specified as %{variable_name} and to output a normal % you just write
them as %%. You can output a newline by using \n, a carriage return with
\r and a tab space with \t.</p>
<p>
The output is by default written to standard output, but can be changed
with %{stderr} and %output{}.</p>
<p>
Output HTTP headers from the most recent request by using
<em>%header{name}</em> where <em>name</em> is the case insensitive name of the header
(without the trailing colon). The header contents are exactly as sent
over the network, with leading and trailing whitespace trimmed (added in
7.84.0).</p>
<p>
Select a specific target destination file to write the output to, by
using <em>%output{name}</em> (added in curl 8.3.0) where <em>name</em> is the full
filename. The output following that instruction is then written to that
file. More than one <em>%output{}</em> instruction can be specified in the same
write-out argument. If the filename cannot be created, curl leaves the
output destination to the one used prior to the <em>%output{}</em> instruction.
Use <em>%output{&gt;&gt;name}</em> to append data to an existing file.</p>
<p>
This output is done independently of if the file transfer was successful
or not.</p>
<p>
If the specified action or output specified with this option fails in
any way, it does not make curl return a (different) error.</p>
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> On Windows, the %-symbol is a special symbol used to expand
environment variables. In batch files, all occurrences of % must be
doubled when using this option to properly escape. If this option is
used at the command prompt then the % cannot be escaped and unintended
expansion is possible.</p>

<dd>Sets the proxy server to use
for HTTP.</dd>
<dt>
HTTPS_PROXY [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]
</dt>
<dd>Sets the proxy server to use
for HTTPS.</dd>
<dt>
[url-protocol]_PROXY [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]
</dt>
<dd>Sets the proxy
server to use for [url-protocol], where the protocol is a protocol
that curl supports and as specified in a URL. FTP, FTPS, POP3, IMAP,
SMTP, LDAP, etc.</dd>
<dt>
ALL_PROXY [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]
</dt>
<dd>Sets the proxy server to use
if no protocol-specific proxy is set.</dd>
<dt>
NO_PROXY &lt;comma-separated list of hosts/domains&gt;
</dt>
<dd>list of hostnames
that should not go through any proxy. If set to an asterisk &#39;*&#39; only,
it matches all hosts. Each name in this list is matched as either a
domain name which contains the hostname, or the hostname itself.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This environment variable disables use of the proxy even when specified
with the <em>-x, –proxy</em> option. That is</p>
<pre class="example">
NO_PROXY=direct.example.com curl -x http://proxy.example.com
http://direct.example.com
</pre>
<p>
accesses the target URL directly, and</p>
<pre class="example">
NO_PROXY=direct.example.com curl -x http://proxy.example.com
http://somewhere.example.com
</pre>
<p>
accesses the target URL through the proxy.</p>
<p>
The list of hostnames can also be include numerical IP addresses, and
IPv6 versions should then be given without enclosing brackets.</p>
<p>
IP addresses can be specified using CIDR notation: an appended slash and
number specifies the number of &#34;network bits&#34; out of the address to use
in the comparison (added in 7.86.0). For example &#34;192.168.0.0/16&#34; would
match all addresses starting with &#34;192.168&#34;.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
APPDATA &lt;dir&gt;
</dt>
<dd>On Windows, this variable is used when trying to find
the home directory. If the primary home variable are all unset.</dd>
<dt>
COLUMNS &lt;terminal width&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If set, the specified number of characters
is used as the terminal width when the alternative progress-bar is
shown. If not set, curl tries to figure it out using other ways.</dd>
<dt>
CURL_CA_BUNDLE &lt;file&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If set, it is used as the <em>–cacert</em> value.
This environment variable is ignored if Schannel is used as the TLS
backend.</dd>
<dt>
CURL_HOME &lt;dir&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If set, is the first variable curl checks when
trying to find its home directory. If not set, it continues to check
<em>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</em></dd>
<dt>
CURL_SSL_BACKEND &lt;TLS backend&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If curl was built with support for
&#34;MultiSSL&#34;, meaning that it has built-in support for more than one TLS
backend, this environment variable can be set to the case insensitive
name of the particular backend to use when curl is invoked. Setting a
name that is not a built-in alternative makes curl stay with the
default.</dd>
</dl>
<p>SSL backend names (case-insensitive): <strong>bearssl</strong>, <strong>gnutls</strong>, <strong>mbedtls</strong>,
<strong>openssl</strong>, <strong>rustls</strong>, <strong>schannel</strong>, <strong>secure-transport</strong>, <strong>wolfssl</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>
HOME &lt;dir&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If set, this is used to find the home directory when
that is needed. Like when looking for the default .curlrc. <em>CURL_HOME</em>
and <em>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</em> have preference.</dd>
<dt>
QLOGDIR &lt;directory name&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If curl was built with HTTP/3 support,
setting this environment variable to a local directory makes curl
produce <strong>qlogs</strong> in that directory, using file names named after the
destination connection id (in hex). Do note that these files can
become rather large. Works with the ngtcp2 and quiche QUIC backends.</dd>
<dt>
SHELL
</dt>
<dd>Used on VMS when trying to detect if using a <strong>DCL</strong> or a
<strong>unix</strong> shell.</dd>
<dt>
SSL_CERT_DIR &lt;dir&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If set, it is used as the <em>–capath</em> value. This
environment variable is ignored if Schannel is used as the TLS
backend.</dd>
<dt>
SSL_CERT_FILE &lt;path&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If set, it is used as the <em>–cacert</em> value.
This environment variable is ignored if Schannel is used as the TLS
backend.</dd>
<dt>
SSLKEYLOGFILE &lt;filename&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If you set this environment variable to a
filename, curl stores TLS secrets from its connections in that file
when invoked to enable you to analyze the TLS traffic in real time
using network analyzing tools such as Wireshark. This works with the
following TLS backends: OpenSSL, LibreSSL (TLS 1.2 max), BoringSSL,
GnuTLS and wolfSSL.</dd>
<dt>
USERPROFILE &lt;dir&gt;
</dt>
<dd>On Windows, this variable is used when trying to
find the home directory. If the other, primary, variable are all
unset. If set, curl uses the path <strong>&#34;$USERPROFILE\Application Data&#34;</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
XDG_CONFIG_HOME &lt;dir&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If <em>CURL_HOME</em> is not set, this variable is
checked when looking for a default .curlrc file.</dd>

PROXY PROTOCOL PREFIXES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The proxy string may be specified with a protocol:// prefix to specify
alternative proxy protocols.</p>
<p>
If no protocol is specified in the proxy string or if the string does
not match a supported one, the proxy is treated as an HTTP proxy.</p>
<p>
The supported proxy protocol prefixes are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
http://
</dt>
<dd>Makes it use it as an HTTP proxy. The default if no scheme
prefix is used.</dd>
<dt>
https://
</dt>
<dd>Makes it treated as an <strong>HTTPS</strong> proxy.</dd>
<dt>
socks4://
</dt>
<dd>Makes it the equivalent of <em>–socks4</em></dd>
<dt>
socks4a://
</dt>
<dd>Makes it the equivalent of <em>–socks4a</em></dd>
<dt>
socks5://

EXIT CODES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-2">
<p>There are a bunch of different error codes and their corresponding error
messages that may appear under error conditions. At the time of this
writing, the exit codes are:</p>
<ol>
<li value="0">Success. The operation completed successfully according to the
instructions.</li>
<li>Unsupported protocol. This build of curl has no support for this
protocol.</li>
<li>Failed to initialize.</li>
<li>URL malformed. The syntax was not correct.</li>
<li>A feature or option that was needed to perform the desired request
was not enabled or was explicitly disabled at build-time. To make
curl able to do this, you probably need another build of libcurl.</li>
<li>Could not resolve proxy. The given proxy host could not be resolved.</li>
<li>Could not resolve host. The given remote host could not be resolved.</li>
<li>Failed to connect to host.</li>
<li>Weird server reply. The server sent data curl could not parse.</li>
<li>FTP access denied. The server denied login or denied access to the
particular resource or directory you wanted to reach. Most often you
tried to change to a directory that does not exist on the server.</li>
<li>FTP accept failed. While waiting for the server to connect back when
an active FTP session is used, an error code was sent over the
control connection or similar.</li>
<li>FTP weird PASS reply. Curl could not parse the reply sent to the
PASS request.</li>
<li>During an active FTP session while waiting for the server to connect
back to curl, the timeout expired.</li>
<li>FTP weird PASV reply, Curl could not parse the reply sent to the
PASV request.</li>
<li>FTP weird 227 format. Curl could not parse the 227-line the server
sent.</li>
<li>FTP cannot use host. Could not resolve the host IP we got in the
227-line.</li>
<li>HTTP/2 error. A problem was detected in the HTTP2 framing layer.
This is somewhat generic and can be one out of several problems, see
the error message for details.</li>
<li>FTP could not set binary. Could not change transfer method to
binary.</li>
<li>Partial file. Only a part of the file was transferred.</li>
<li>FTP could not download/access the given file, the RETR (or similar)
command failed.</li>
<li>FTP quote error. A quote command returned error from the server.</li>
<li>HTTP page not retrieved. The requested URL was not found or returned
another error with the HTTP error code being 400 or above. This
return code only appears if <em>-f, –fail</em> is used.</li>
<li>Write error. Curl could not write data to a local filesystem or
similar.</li>
<li>Failed starting the upload. For FTP, the server typically denied the
STOR command.</li>
<li>Read error. Various reading problems.</li>
<li>Out of memory. A memory allocation request failed.</li>
<li>Operation timeout. The specified time-out period was reached
according to the conditions.</li>
<li>FTP PORT failed. The PORT command failed. Not all FTP servers
support the PORT command, try doing a transfer using PASV instead.</li>
<li>FTP could not use REST. The REST command failed. This command is
used for resumed FTP transfers.</li>
<li>HTTP range error. The range &#34;command&#34; did not work.</li>
