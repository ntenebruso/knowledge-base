DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Run tasks to optimize Git repository data, speeding up other Git
commands and reducing storage requirements for the repository.</p>
<p>
Git commands that add repository data, such as <strong>git add</strong> or <strong>git fetch</strong>,
are optimized for a responsive user experience. These commands do not
take time to optimize the Git data, since such optimizations scale with
the full size of the repository while these user commands each perform a
relatively small action.</p>
<p>
The <strong>git maintenance</strong> command provides flexibility for how to optimize
the Git repository.</p>

<h2 id="headline-4">
SUBCOMMANDS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>run</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run one or more maintenance tasks. If one or more <strong>–task</strong> options are
specified, then those tasks are run in that order. Otherwise, the tasks
are determined by which <strong>maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.enabled</strong> config options are
true. By default, only <strong>maintenance.gc.enabled</strong> is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
start</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Start running maintenance on the current repository. This performs the
same config updates as the <strong>register</strong> subcommand, then updates the
background scheduler to run <strong>git maintenance run –scheduled</strong> on an
hourly basis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
stop</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Halt the background maintenance schedule. The current repository is not
removed from the list of maintained repositories, in case the background
maintenance is restarted later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
register</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Initialize Git config values so any scheduled maintenance will start
running on this repository. This adds the repository to the
<strong>maintenance.repo</strong> config variable in the current user&#39;s global config,
or the config specified by –config-file option, and enables some
recommended configuration values for <strong>maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.schedule</strong>. The
tasks that are enabled are safe for running in the background without
disrupting foreground processes.</p>
<p>
The <strong>register</strong> subcommand will also set the <strong>maintenance.strategy</strong>
config value to <strong>incremental</strong>, if this value is not previously set. The
<strong>incremental</strong> strategy uses the following schedule for each maintenance
task:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>gc</strong>: disabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>commit-graph</strong>: hourly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>prefetch</strong>: hourly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>loose-objects</strong>: daily.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>incremental-repack</strong>: daily.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>git maintenance register</strong> will also disable foreground maintenance by
setting <strong>maintenance.auto = false</strong> in the current repository. This
config setting will remain after a <strong>git maintenance unregister</strong> command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
unregister</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remove the current repository from background maintenance. This only
removes the repository from the configured list. It does not stop the
background maintenance processes from running.</p>
<p>
The <strong>unregister</strong> subcommand will report an error if the current
repository is not already registered. Use the <strong>–force</strong> option to return
success even when the current repository is not registered.</p>

TASKS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>commit-graph</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>commit-graph</strong> job updates the <strong>commit-graph</strong> files incrementally,
then verifies that the written data is correct. The incremental write is
safe to run alongside concurrent Git processes since it will not expire
<strong>.graph</strong> files that were in the previous <strong>commit-graph-chain</strong> file. They
will be deleted by a later run based on the expiration delay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
prefetch</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>prefetch</strong> task updates the object directory with the latest objects
from all registered remotes. For each remote, a <strong>git fetch</strong> command is
run. The configured refspec is modified to place all requested refs
within <strong>refs/prefetch/</strong>. Also, tags are not updated.</p>
<p>
This is done to avoid disrupting the remote-tracking branches. The end
users expect these refs to stay unmoved unless they initiate a fetch.
However, with the prefetch task, the objects necessary to complete a
later real fetch would already be obtained, making the real fetch
faster. In the ideal case, it will just become an update to a bunch of
remote-tracking branches without any object transfer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clean up unnecessary files and optimize the local repository. &#34;GC&#34;
stands for &#34;garbage collection,&#34; but this task performs many smaller
tasks. This task can be expensive for large repositories, as it repacks
all Git objects into a single pack-file. It can also be disruptive in
some situations, as it deletes stale data. See *git-gc*(1) for more
details on garbage collection in Git.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
loose-objects</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>loose-objects</strong> job cleans up loose objects and places them into
pack-files. In order to prevent race conditions with concurrent Git
commands, it follows a two-step process. First, it deletes any loose
objects that already exist in a pack-file; concurrent Git processes will
examine the pack-file for the object data instead of the loose object.
Second, it creates a new pack-file (starting with &#34;loose-&#34;) containing a
batch of loose objects. The batch size is limited to 50 thousand objects
to prevent the job from taking too long on a repository with many loose
objects. The <strong>gc</strong> task writes unreachable objects as loose objects to be
cleaned up by a later step only if they are not re-added to a pack-file;
for this reason it is not advisable to enable both the <strong>loose-objects</strong>
and <strong>gc</strong> tasks at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
incremental-repack</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>incremental-repack</strong> job repacks the object directory using the
<strong>multi-pack-index</strong> feature. In order to prevent race conditions with
concurrent Git commands, it follows a two-step process. First, it calls
<strong>git multi-pack-index expire</strong> to delete pack-files unreferenced by the
<strong>multi-pack-index</strong> file. Second, it calls <strong>git multi-pack-index repack</strong>
to select several small pack-files and repack them into a bigger one,
and then update the <strong>multi-pack-index</strong> entries that refer to the small
pack-files to refer to the new pack-file. This prepares those small
pack-files for deletion upon the next run of <strong>git multi-pack-index
expire</strong>. The selection of the small pack-files is such that the expected
size of the big pack-file is at least the batch size; see the
<strong>–batch-size</strong> option for the <strong>repack</strong> subcommand in
*git-multi-pack-index*(1). The default batch-size is zero, which is a
special case that attempts to repack all pack-files into a single
pack-file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pack-refs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>pack-refs</strong> task collects the loose reference files and collects
them into a single file. This speeds up operations that need to iterate
across many references. See *git-pack-refs*(1) for more information.</p>
</blockquote>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>–auto</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When combined with the <strong>run</strong> subcommand, run maintenance tasks only if
certain thresholds are met. For example, the <strong>gc</strong> task runs when the
number of loose objects exceeds the number stored in the <strong>gc.auto</strong>
config setting, or when the number of pack-files exceeds the
<strong>gc.autoPackLimit</strong> config setting. Not compatible with the <strong>–schedule</strong>
option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–schedule</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When combined with the <strong>run</strong> subcommand, run maintenance tasks only if
certain time conditions are met, as specified by the
<strong>maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.schedule</strong> config value for each <strong>&lt;task&gt;</strong>. This
config value specifies a number of seconds since the last time that task
ran, according to the <strong>maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.lastRun</strong> config value. The
tasks that are tested are those provided by the <strong>–task=&lt;task&gt;</strong>
option(s) or those with <strong>maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.enabled</strong> set to true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–quiet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not report progress or other information over <strong>stderr</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–task=&lt;task&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this option is specified one or more times, then only run the
specified tasks in the specified order. If no <strong>–task=&lt;task&gt;</strong> arguments
are specified, then only the tasks with <strong>maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.enabled</strong>
configured as <strong>true</strong> are considered. See the <em>TASKS</em> section for the
list of accepted <strong>&lt;task&gt;</strong> values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–scheduler=auto|crontab|systemd-timer|launchctl|schtasks</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When combined with the <strong>start</strong> subcommand, specify the scheduler for
running the hourly, daily and weekly executions of <strong>git maintenance
run</strong>. Possible values for <strong>&lt;scheduler&gt;</strong> are <strong>auto</strong>, <strong>crontab</strong> (POSIX),
<strong>systemd-timer</strong> (Linux), <strong>launchctl</strong> (macOS), and <strong>schtasks</strong> (Windows).
When <strong>auto</strong> is specified, the appropriate platform-specific scheduler is
used; on Linux, <strong>systemd-timer</strong> is used if available, otherwise
<strong>crontab</strong>. Default is <strong>auto</strong>.</p>

TROUBLESHOOTING
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The <strong>git maintenance</strong> command is designed to simplify the repository
maintenance patterns while minimizing user wait time during Git
commands. A variety of configuration options are available to allow
customizing this process. The default maintenance options focus on
operations that complete quickly, even on large repositories.</p>
<p>
Users may find some cases where scheduled maintenance tasks do not run
as frequently as intended. Each <strong>git maintenance run</strong> command takes a
lock on the repository&#39;s object database, and this prevents other
concurrent <strong>git maintenance run</strong> commands from running on the same
repository. Without this safeguard, competing processes could leave the
repository in an unpredictable state.</p>
<p>
The background maintenance schedule runs <strong>git maintenance run</strong> processes
on an hourly basis. Each run executes the &#34;hourly&#34; tasks. At midnight,
that process also executes the &#34;daily&#34; tasks. At midnight on the first
day of the week, that process also executes the &#34;weekly&#34; tasks. A single
process iterates over each registered repository, performing the
scheduled tasks for that frequency. Depending on the number of
registered repositories and their sizes, this process may take longer
than an hour. In this case, multiple <strong>git maintenance run</strong> commands may
run on the same repository at the same time, colliding on the object
database lock. This results in one of the two tasks not running.</p>
<p>
If you find that some maintenance windows are taking longer than one
hour to complete, then consider reducing the complexity of your
maintenance tasks. For example, the <strong>gc</strong> task is much slower than the
<strong>incremental-repack</strong> task. However, this comes at a cost of a slightly
larger object database. Consider moving more expensive tasks to be run
less frequently.</p>
<p>
Expert users may consider scheduling their own maintenance tasks using a
different schedule than is available through <strong>git maintenance start</strong> and
Git configuration options. These users should be aware of the object
database lock and how concurrent <strong>git maintenance run</strong> commands behave.
Further, the <strong>git gc</strong> command should not be combined with <strong>git
maintenance run</strong> commands. <strong>git gc</strong> modifies the object database but
does not take the lock in the same way as <strong>git maintenance run</strong>. If
possible, use <strong>git maintenance run –task=gc</strong> instead of <strong>git gc</strong>.</p>
<p>
The following sections describe the mechanisms put in place to run
background maintenance by <strong>git maintenance start</strong> and how to customize
them.</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-8">
BACKGROUND MAINTENANCE ON POSIX SYSTEMS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The standard mechanism for scheduling background tasks on POSIX systems
is cron(8). This tool executes commands based on a given schedule. The
current list of user-scheduled tasks can be found by running <strong>crontab
-l</strong>. The schedule written by <strong>git maintenance start</strong> is similar to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# BEGIN GIT MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE
# The following schedule was created by Git
# Any edits made in this region might be
# replaced in the future by a Git command.

0 1-23 * * * &#34;/&lt;path&gt;/git&#34; --exec-path=&#34;/&lt;path&gt;&#34; for-each-repo --config=maintenance.repo maintenance run --schedule=hourly
0 0 * * 1-6 &#34;/&lt;path&gt;/git&#34; --exec-path=&#34;/&lt;path&gt;&#34; for-each-repo --config=maintenance.repo maintenance run --schedule=daily
0 0 * * 0 &#34;/&lt;path&gt;/git&#34; --exec-path=&#34;/&lt;path&gt;&#34; for-each-repo --config=maintenance.repo maintenance run --schedule=weekly

# END GIT MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The comments are used as a region to mark the schedule as written by
Git. Any modifications within this region will be completely deleted by
<strong>git maintenance stop</strong> or overwritten by <strong>git maintenance start</strong>.</p>
<p>
The <strong>crontab</strong> entry specifies the full path of the <strong>git</strong> executable to
ensure that the executed <strong>git</strong> command is the same one with which <strong>git
maintenance start</strong> was issued independent of <strong>PATH</strong>. If the same user
runs <strong>git maintenance start</strong> with multiple Git executables, then only
the latest executable is used.</p>
<p>
These commands use <strong>git for-each-repo –config=maintenance.repo</strong> to run
<strong>git maintenance run –schedule=&lt;frequency&gt;</strong> on each repository listed
in the multi-valued <strong>maintenance.repo</strong> config option. These are
typically loaded from the user-specific global config. The <strong>git
maintenance</strong> process then determines which maintenance tasks are
configured to run on each repository with each <strong>&lt;frequency&gt;</strong> using the
<strong>maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.schedule</strong> config options. These values are loaded
from the global or repository config values.</p>
<p>
If the config values are insufficient to achieve your desired background
maintenance schedule, then you can create your own schedule. If you run
<strong>crontab -e</strong>, then an editor will load with your user-specific <strong>cron</strong>
schedule. In that editor, you can add your own schedule lines. You could
start by adapting the default schedule listed earlier, or you could read
the crontab(5) documentation for advanced scheduling techniques. Please
do use the full path and <strong>–exec-path</strong> techniques from the default
schedule to ensure you are executing the correct binaries in your
schedule.</p>

BACKGROUND MAINTENANCE ON LINUX SYSTEMD SYSTEMS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p>While Linux supports <strong>cron</strong>, depending on the distribution, <strong>cron</strong> may
be an optional package not necessarily installed. On modern Linux
distributions, systemd timers are superseding it.</p>
<p>
If user systemd timers are available, they will be used as a replacement
of <strong>cron</strong>.</p>
<p>
In this case, <strong>git maintenance start</strong> will create user systemd timer
units and start the timers. The current list of user-scheduled tasks can
be found by running <strong>systemctl –user list-timers</strong>. The timers written
by <strong>git maintenance start</strong> are similar to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ systemctl --user list-timers
NEXT                         LEFT          LAST                         PASSED     UNIT                         ACTIVATES
Thu 2021-04-29 19:00:00 CEST 42min left    Thu 2021-04-29 18:00:11 CEST 17min ago  git-maintenance@hourly.timer git-maintenance@hourly.service
Fri 2021-04-30 00:00:00 CEST 5h 42min left Thu 2021-04-29 00:00:11 CEST 18h ago    git-maintenance@daily.timer  git-maintenance@daily.service
Mon 2021-05-03 00:00:00 CEST 3 days left   Mon 2021-04-26 00:00:11 CEST 3 days ago git-maintenance@weekly.timer git-maintenance@weekly.service
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
One timer is registered for each <strong>–schedule=&lt;frequency&gt;</strong> option.</p>
<p>
The definition of the systemd units can be inspected in the following
files:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
~/.config/systemd/user/git-maintenance@.timer
~/.config/systemd/user/git-maintenance@.service
~/.config/systemd/user/timers.target.wants/git-maintenance@hourly.timer
~/.config/systemd/user/timers.target.wants/git-maintenance@daily.timer
~/.config/systemd/user/timers.target.wants/git-maintenance@weekly.timer
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>git maintenance start</strong> will overwrite these files and start the timer
again with <strong>systemctl –user</strong>, so any customization should be done by
creating a drop-in file, i.e. a <strong>.conf</strong> suffixed file in the
<strong>~/.config/systemd/user/git-maintenance@.service.d</strong> directory.</p>
<p>
<strong>git maintenance stop</strong> will stop the user systemd timers and delete the
above mentioned files.</p>
<p>
For more details, see <strong>systemd.timer(5)</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-10" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-10">
BACKGROUND MAINTENANCE ON MACOS SYSTEMS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-2">
<p>While macOS technically supports <strong>cron</strong>, using <strong>crontab -e</strong> requires
elevated privileges and the executed process does not have a full user
context. Without a full user context, Git and its credential helpers
cannot access stored credentials, so some maintenance tasks are not
functional.</p>
<p>
Instead, <strong>git maintenance start</strong> interacts with the <strong>launchctl</strong> tool,
which is the recommended way to schedule timed jobs in macOS. Scheduling
maintenance through <strong>git maintenance (start|stop)</strong> requires some
<strong>launchctl</strong> features available only in macOS 10.11 or later.</p>
<p>
Your user-specific scheduled tasks are stored as XML-formatted <strong>.plist</strong>
files in <strong>~/Library/LaunchAgents/</strong>. You can see the currently-registered
tasks using the following command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ ls ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.git-scm.git*
org.git-scm.git.daily.plist
org.git-scm.git.hourly.plist
org.git-scm.git.weekly.plist
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
One task is registered for each <strong>–schedule=&lt;frequency&gt;</strong> option. To
inspect how the XML format describes each schedule, open one of these
<strong>.plist</strong> files in an editor and inspect the <strong>&lt;array&gt;</strong> element following
the <strong>&lt;key&gt;StartCalendarInterval&lt;/key&gt;</strong> element.</p>
<p>
<strong>git maintenance start</strong> will overwrite these files and register the
tasks again with <strong>launchctl</strong>, so any customizations should be done by
creating your own <strong>.plist</strong> files with distinct names. Similarly, the
<strong>git maintenance stop</strong> command will unregister the tasks with
<strong>launchctl</strong> and delete the <strong>.plist</strong> files.</p>
<p>
To create more advanced customizations to your background tasks, see
launchctl.plist(5) for more information.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-11" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-11">
BACKGROUND MAINTENANCE ON WINDOWS SYSTEMS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Windows does not support <strong>cron</strong> and instead has its own system for
scheduling background tasks. The <strong>git maintenance start</strong> command uses
the <strong>schtasks</strong> command to submit tasks to this system. You can inspect
all background tasks using the Task Scheduler application. The tasks
added by Git have names of the form <strong>Git Maintenance (&lt;frequency&gt;)</strong>. The
Task Scheduler GUI has ways to inspect these tasks, but you can also
export the tasks to XML files and view the details there.</p>
<p>
Note that since Git is a console application, these background tasks
create a console window visible to the current user. This can be changed
manually by selecting the &#34;Run whether user is logged in or not&#34; option
in Task Scheduler. This change requires a password input, which is why
<strong>git maintenance start</strong> does not select it by default.</p>
<p>
If you want to customize the background tasks, please rename the tasks
so future calls to <strong>git maintenance (start|stop)</strong> do not overwrite your
custom tasks.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
maintenance.strategy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This string config option provides a way to specify one of a few
recommended schedules for background maintenance. This only affects
which tasks are run during <strong>git maintenance run –schedule=X</strong> commands,
provided no <strong>–task=&lt;task&gt;</strong> arguments are provided. Further, if a
<strong>maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.schedule</strong> config value is set, then that value is
used instead of the one provided by <strong>maintenance.strategy</strong>. The possible
strategy strings are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>none</strong>: This default setting implies no tasks are run at any schedule.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>incremental</strong>: This setting optimizes for performing small maintenance
activities that do not delete any data. This does not schedule the <strong>gc</strong>
task, but runs the <strong>prefetch</strong> and <strong>commit-graph</strong> tasks hourly, the
<strong>loose-objects</strong> and <strong>incremental-repack</strong> tasks daily, and the
<strong>pack-refs</strong> task weekly.</p>
