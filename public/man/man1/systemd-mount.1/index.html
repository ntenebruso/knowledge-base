DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>systemd-mount</strong> may be used to create and start a transient .mount or
.automount unit of the file system <em>WHAT</em> on the mount point <em>WHERE</em>.</p>
<p>
In many ways, <strong>systemd-mount</strong> is similar to the lower-level *mount*(8)
command, however instead of executing the mount operation directly and
immediately, <strong>systemd-mount</strong> schedules it through the service manager
job queue, so that it may pull in further dependencies (such as parent
mounts, or a file system checker to execute a priori), and may make use
of the auto-mounting logic.</p>
<p>
The command takes either one or two arguments. If only one argument is
specified it should refer to a block device or regular file containing a
file system (e.g. &#34;/dev/sdb1&#34; or &#34;/path/to/disk.img&#34;). The block device
or image file is then probed for a file system label and other metadata,
and is mounted to a directory below <em>run/media/system</em> whose name is
generated from the file system label. In this mode the block device or
image file must exist at the time of invocation of the command, so that
it may be probed. If the device is found to be a removable block device
(e.g. a USB stick), an automount point is created instead of a regular
mount point (i.e. the <strong>–automount=</strong> option is implied, see below). If
the option <strong>–tmpfs</strong> is specified, then the argument is interpreted as
the path where the new temporary file system shall be mounted.</p>
<p>
If two arguments are specified, the first indicates the mount source
(the <em>WHAT</em>) and the second indicates the path to mount it on (the
<em>WHERE</em>). In this mode no probing of the source is attempted, and a
backing device node doesnt have to exist. However, if this mode is
combined with <strong>–discover</strong>, device node probing for additional metadata
is enabled, and – much like in the single-argument case discussed above
– the specified device has to exist at the time of invocation of the
command.</p>
<p>
Use the <strong>–list</strong> command to show a terse table of all local, known block
devices with file systems that may be mounted with this command.</p>
<p>
<strong>systemd-umount</strong> can be used to unmount a mount or automount point. It
is the same as <strong>systemd-mount</strong> <strong>–umount</strong>.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The following options are understood:</p>
<p>
<strong>–no-block</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not synchronously wait for the requested operation to finish. If this
is not specified, the job will be verified, enqueued and <strong>systemd-mount</strong>
will wait until the mount or automount units start-up is completed. By
passing this argument, it is only verified and enqueued.</p>
<p>
Added in version 232.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-l</strong>, <strong>–full</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not ellipsize the output when <strong>–list</strong> is specified.</p>
<p>
Added in version 245.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–no-pager</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not pipe output into a pager.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–no-legend</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer with hints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–no-ask-password</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not query the user for authentication for privileged operations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–quiet</strong>, <strong>-q</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppresses additional informational output while running.</p>
<p>
Added in version 232.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–discover</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable probing of the mount source. This switch is implied if a single
argument is specified on the command line. If passed, additional
metadata is read from the device to enhance the unit to create. For
example, a descriptive string for the transient units is generated from
the file system label and device model. Moreover if a removable block
device (e.g. USB stick) is detected an automount unit instead of a
regular mount unit is created, with a short idle timeout, in order to
ensure the file-system is placed in a clean state quickly after each
access.</p>
<p>
Added in version 232.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–type=</strong>, <strong>-t</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the file system type to mount (e.g. &#34;vfat&#34; or &#34;ext4&#34;). If
omitted or set to &#34;auto&#34;, the file system type is determined
automatically.</p>
<p>
Added in version 232.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–options=</strong>, <strong>-o</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additional mount options for the mount point.</p>
<p>
Added in version 232.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–owner=*/USER/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let the specified user <em>USER</em> own the mounted file system. This is done
by appending <strong>uid=</strong> and <strong>gid=</strong> options to the list of mount options.
Only certain file systems support this option.</p>
<p>
Added in version 237.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–fsck=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument, defaults to on. Controls whether to run a file
system check immediately before the mount operation. In the automount
case (see <strong>–automount=</strong> below) the check will be run the moment the
first access to the device is made, which might slightly delay the
access.</p>
<p>
Added in version 232.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–description=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provide a description for the mount or automount unit. See
<em>Description=</em> in *systemd.unit*(5).</p>
<p>
Added in version 232.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–property=</strong>, <strong>-p</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets a unit property for the mount unit that is created. This takes an
assignment in the same format as <strong>systemctl*(1)s *set-property</strong> command.</p>
<p>
Added in version 232.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–automount=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument. Controls whether to create an automount point
or a regular mount point. If true an automount point is created that is
backed by the actual file system at the time of first access. If false a
plain mount point is created that is backed by the actual file system
immediately. Automount points have the benefit that the file system
stays unmounted and hence in clean state until it is first accessed. In
automount mode the <strong>–timeout-idle-sec=</strong> switch (see below) may be used
to ensure the mount point is unmounted automatically after the last
access and an idle period passed.</p>
<p>
If this switch is not specified it defaults to false. If not specified
and <strong>–discover</strong> is used (or only a single argument passed, which
implies <strong>–discover</strong>, see above), and the file system block device is
detected to be removable, it is set to true, in order to increase the
chance that the file system is in a fully clean state if the device is
unplugged abruptly.</p>
<p>
Added in version 232.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-A</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Equivalent to <strong>–automount=yes</strong>.</p>
<p>
Added in version 232.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–timeout-idle-sec=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a time value that controls the idle timeout in automount mode. If
set to &#34;infinity&#34; (the default) no automatic unmounts are done.
Otherwise the file system backing the automount point is detached after
the last access and the idle timeout passed. See *systemd.time*(7) for
details on the time syntax supported. This option has no effect if only
a regular mount is established, and automounting is not used.</p>
<p>
Note that if <strong>–discover</strong> is used (or only a single argument passed,
which implies <strong>–discover</strong>, see above), and the file system block device
is detected to be removable, <strong>–timeout-idle-sec=1s</strong> is implied.</p>
<p>
Added in version 232.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–automount-property=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similar to <strong>–property=</strong>, but applies additional properties to the
automount unit created, instead of the mount unit.</p>
<p>
Added in version 232.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–bind-device</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option only has an effect in automount mode, and controls whether
the automount unit shall be bound to the backing devices lifetime. If
set, the automount unit will be stopped automatically when the backing
device vanishes. By default the automount unit stays around, and
subsequent accesses will block until backing device is replugged. This
option has no effect in case of non-device mounts, such as network or
virtual file system mounts.</p>
<p>
Note that if <strong>–discover</strong> is used (or only a single argument passed,
which implies <strong>–discover</strong>, see above), and the file system block device
is detected to be removable, this option is implied.</p>
<p>
Added in version 232.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–list</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of establishing a mount or automount point, print a terse list
of block devices containing file systems that may be mounted with
&#34;systemd-mount&#34;, along with useful metadata such as labels, etc.</p>
<p>
Added in version 232.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-u</strong>, <strong>–umount</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop the mount and automount units corresponding to the specified mount
points <em>WHERE</em> or the devices <em>WHAT</em>. <strong>systemd-mount</strong> with this option
or <strong>systemd-umount</strong> can take multiple arguments which can be mount
points, devices, /etc/fstab style node names, or backing files
corresponding to loop devices, like *systemd-mount –umount
/path/to/umount /dev/sda1 UUID=xxxxxx-xxxx LABEL=xxxxx
/path/to/disk.img*. Note that when <strong>-H</strong> or <strong>-M</strong> is specified, only
absolute paths to mount points are supported.</p>
<p>
Added in version 233.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-G</strong>, <strong>–collect</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unload the transient unit after it completed, even if it failed.
Normally, without this option, all mount units that mount and failed are
kept in memory until the user explicitly resets their failure state with
<strong>systemctl reset-failed</strong> or an equivalent command. On the other hand,
units that stopped successfully are unloaded immediately. If this option
is turned on the &#34;garbage collection&#34; of units is more aggressive, and
unloads units regardless if they exited successfully or failed. This
option is a shortcut for <strong>–property=CollectMode=inactive-or-failed</strong>,
see the explanation for <em>CollectMode=</em> in *systemd.unit*(5) for further
information.</p>
<p>
Added in version 236.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-T</strong>, <strong>–tmpfs</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create and mount a new <strong>tmpfs</strong> file system on <em>WHERE</em>, with an optional
<em>NAME</em> that defaults to &#34;tmpfs&#34;.</p>
<p>
The file system is mounted with the top-level directory mode determined
by the <strong>umask*(2) setting of the caller, i.e. *rwxrwxrwx</strong> masked by the
umask of the caller. This matches what *mkdir*(1) does, but is different
from the kernel default of &#34;rwxrwxrwxt&#34;, i.e. a world-writable directory
with the sticky bit set.</p>
<p>
Added in version 255.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–user</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Talk to the service manager of the calling user, rather than the service
manager of the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–system</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Talk to the service manager of the system. This is the implied default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-H</strong>, <strong>–host=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a username and
hostname separated by &#34;@&#34;, to connect to. The hostname may optionally be
suffixed by a port ssh is listening on, separated by &#34;:&#34;, and then a
container name, separated by &#34;/&#34;, which connects directly to a specific
container on the specified host. This will use SSH to talk to the remote
machine manager instance. Container names may be enumerated with
*machinectl -H */HOST/. Put IPv6 addresses in brackets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-M</strong>, <strong>–machine=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container name to
connect to, optionally prefixed by a user name to connect as and a
separating &#34;@&#34; character. If the special string &#34;.host&#34; is used in place
of the container name, a connection to the local system is made (which
is useful to connect to a specific users user bus: &#34;–user
–machine=lennart@.host&#34;). If the &#34;@&#34; syntax is not used, the connection
is made as root user. If the &#34;@&#34; syntax is used either the left hand
side or the right hand side may be omitted (but not both) in which case
the local user name and &#34;.host&#34; are implied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-h</strong>, <strong>–help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short version string and exit.</p>
