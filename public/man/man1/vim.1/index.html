DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>Vim</strong> is a text editor that is upwards compatible to Vi. It can be used
to edit all kinds of plain text. It is especially useful for editing
programs.</p>
<p>
There are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi
windows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line editing, filename
completion, on-line help, visual selection, etc.. See &#34;:help
vi_diff.txt&#34; for a summary of the differences between <strong>Vim</strong> and Vi.</p>
<p>
While running <strong>Vim</strong> a lot of help can be obtained from the on-line help
system, with the &#34;:help&#34; command. See the ON-LINE HELP section below.</p>
<p>
Most often <strong>Vim</strong> is started to edit a single file with the command</p>
<p>
vim file</p>
<p>
More generally <strong>Vim</strong> is started with:</p>
<p>
vim [options] [filelist]</p>
<p>
If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an empty buffer.
Otherwise exactly one out of the following four may be used to choose
one or more files to be edited.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
file ..
</dt>
<dd>A list of filenames. The first one will be the current file
and read into the buffer. The cursor will be positioned on the first
line of the buffer. You can get to the other files with the &#34;:next&#34;
command. To edit a file that starts with a dash, precede the filelist
with &#34;–&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
-
</dt>
<dd>The file to edit is read from stdin. Commands are read from
stderr, which should be a tty.</dd>
<dt>
-t {tag}
</dt>
<dd>The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends
on a &#34;tag&#34;, a sort of goto label. {tag} is looked up in the tags file,
the associated file becomes the current file and the associated
command is executed. Mostly this is used for C programs, in which case
{tag} could be a function name. The effect is that the file containing
that function becomes the current file and the cursor is positioned on
the start of the function. See &#34;:help tag-commands&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
-q [errorfile]
</dt>
<dd>Start in quickFix mode. The file [errorfile] is read
and the first error is displayed. If [errorfile] is omitted, the
filename is obtained from the &#39;errorfile&#39; option (defaults to
&#34;AztecC.Err&#34; for the Amiga, &#34;errors.err&#34; on other systems). Further
errors can be jumped to with the &#34;:cn&#34; command. See &#34;:help quickfix&#34;.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Vim</strong> behaves differently, depending on the name of the command (the
executable may still be the same file).</p>
<dl>
<dt>
vim
</dt>
<dd>The &#34;normal&#34; way, everything is default.</dd>
<dt>
ex
</dt>
<dd>Start in Ex mode. Go to Normal mode with the &#34;:vi&#34; command. Can
also be done with the &#34;-e&#34; argument.</dd>
<dt>
view
</dt>
<dd>Start in read-only mode. You will be protected from writing
the files. Can also be done with the &#34;-R&#34; argument.</dd>
<dt>
gvim gview
</dt>
<dd>The GUI version. Starts a new window. Can also be done
with the &#34;-g&#34; argument.</dd>
<dt>
evim eview
</dt>
<dd>The GUI version in easy mode. Starts a new window. Can
also be done with the &#34;-y&#34; argument.</dd>
<dt>
rvim rview rgvim rgview
</dt>
<dd>Like the above, but with restrictions. It
will not be possible to start shell commands, or suspend <strong>Vim.</strong> Can
also be done with the &#34;-Z&#34; argument.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-4">
OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The options may be given in any order, before or after filenames.
Options without an argument can be combined after a single dash.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
+[num]
</dt>
<dd>For the first file the cursor will be positioned on line
&#34;num&#34;. If &#34;num&#34; is missing, the cursor will be positioned on the last
line.</dd>
<dt>
+/{pat}
</dt>
<dd>For the first file the cursor will be positioned in the
line with the first occurrence of {pat}. See &#34;:help search-pattern&#34;
for the available search patterns.</dd>
<dt>
+{command}
</dt>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>
-c {command}
</dt>
<dd>
<p>{command} will be executed after the
first file has been read. {command} is interpreted as an Ex command.
If the {command} contains spaces it must be enclosed in double
quotes (this depends on the shell that is used). Example: vim &#34;+set
si&#34; main.c<br>
Note: You can use up to 10 &#34;+&#34; or &#34;-c&#34; commands.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-A
</dt>
<dd>If <strong>Vim</strong> has been compiled with ARABIC support for editing
right-to-left oriented files and Arabic keyboard mapping, this
option starts <strong>Vim</strong> in Arabic mode, i.e. &#39;arabic&#39; is set. Otherwise
an error message is given and <strong>Vim</strong> aborts.</dd>
<dt>
-b
</dt>
<dd>Binary mode. A few options will be set that makes it possible
to edit a binary or executable file.</dd>
<dt>
-C
</dt>
<dd>Compatible. Set the &#39;compatible&#39; option. This will make <strong>Vim</strong>
behave mostly like Vi, even though a .vimrc file exists.</dd>
<dt>
-d
</dt>
<dd>Start in diff mode. There should between two to eight file
name arguments. <strong>Vim</strong> will open all the files and show differences
between them. Works like vimdiff(1).</dd>
<dt>
-d {device}, -dev {device}
</dt>
<dd>Open {device} for use as a terminal.
Only on the Amiga. Example: &#34;-d con:20/30/600/150&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
-D
</dt>
<dd>Debugging. Go to debugging mode when executing the first
command from a script.</dd>
<dt>
-e
</dt>
<dd>Start <strong>Vim</strong> in Ex mode, just like the executable was called
&#34;ex&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
-E
</dt>
<dd>Start <strong>Vim</strong> in improved Ex mode, just like the executable was
called &#34;exim&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
-f
</dt>
<dd>Foreground. For the GUI version, <strong>Vim</strong> will not fork and
detach from the shell it was started in. On the Amiga, <strong>Vim</strong> is not
restarted to open a new window. This option should be used when
<strong>Vim</strong> is executed by a program that will wait for the edit session
to finish (e.g. mail). On the Amiga the &#34;:sh&#34; and &#34;:!&#34; commands will
not work.</dd>
<dt>
-F
</dt>
<dd>If <strong>Vim</strong> has been compiled with FKMAP support for editing
right-to-left oriented files and Farsi keyboard mapping, this option
starts <strong>Vim</strong> in Farsi mode, i.e. &#39;fkmap&#39; and &#39;rightleft&#39; are set.
Otherwise an error message is given and <strong>Vim</strong> aborts.<br>
Note: Farsi support has been removed in patch 8.1.0932.</dd>
<dt>
-g
</dt>
<dd>If <strong>Vim</strong> has been compiled with GUI support, this option
enables the GUI. If no GUI support was compiled in, an error message
is given and <strong>Vim</strong> aborts.</dd>
<dt>
-H
</dt>
<dd>If <strong>Vim</strong> has been compiled with RIGHTLEFT support for editing
right-to-left oriented files and Hebrew keyboard mapping, this
option starts <strong>Vim</strong> in Hebrew mode, i.e. &#39;hkmap&#39; and &#39;rightleft&#39; are
set. Otherwise an error message is given and <strong>Vim</strong> aborts.</dd>
<dt>
-i {viminfo}
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the filename to use when reading or
writing the viminfo file, instead of the default &#34;~/.viminfo&#34;. This
can also be used to skip the use of the .viminfo file, by giving the
name &#34;NONE&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
-l
</dt>
<dd>Lisp mode. Sets the &#39;lisp&#39; and &#39;showmatch&#39; options on.</dd>
<dt>
-L
</dt>
<dd>Same as -r.</dd>
<dt>
-m
</dt>
<dd>Modifying files is disabled. Resets the &#39;write&#39; option. You
can still modify the buffer, but writing a file is not possible.</dd>
<dt>
-M
</dt>
<dd>Modifications not allowed. The &#39;modifiable&#39; and &#39;write&#39;
options will be unset, so that changes are not allowed and files can
not be written. Note that these options can be set to enable making
modifications.</dd>
<dt>
-n
</dt>
<dd>No swap file will be used. Recovery after a crash will be
impossible. Handy if you want to edit a file on a very slow medium
(e.g. floppy). Can also be done with &#34;:set uc=0&#34;. Can be undone with
&#34;:set uc=200&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
-N
</dt>
<dd>No-compatible mode. Resets the &#39;compatible&#39; option. This will
make <strong>Vim</strong> behave a bit better, but less Vi compatible, even though
a .vimrc file does not exist.</dd>
<dt>
-nb
</dt>
<dd>Become an editor server for NetBeans. See the docs for
details.</dd>
<dt>
-o[N]
</dt>
<dd>Open N windows stacked. When N is omitted, open one window
for each file.</dd>
<dt>
-O[N]
</dt>
<dd>Open N windows side by side. When N is omitted, open one
window for each file.</dd>
<dt>
-p[N]
</dt>
<dd>Open N tab pages. When N is omitted, open one tab page for
each file.</dd>
<dt>
-P {parent-title}
</dt>
<dd>Win32 GUI only: Specify the title of the parent
application. When possible, Vim will run in an MDI window inside the
application. {parent-title} must appear in the window title of the
parent application. Make sure that it is specific enough. Note that
the implementation is still primitive. It won&#39;t work with all
applications and the menu doesn&#39;t work.</dd>
<dt>
-r
</dt>
<dd>List swap files, with information about using them for
recovery.</dd>
<dt>
-r {file}
</dt>
<dd>Recovery mode. The swap file is used to recover a
crashed editing session. The swap file is a file with the same
filename as the text file with &#34;.swp&#34; appended. See &#34;:help
recovery&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
-R
</dt>
<dd>Read-only mode. The &#39;readonly&#39; option will be set. You can
still edit the buffer, but will be prevented from accidentally
overwriting a file. If you do want to overwrite a file, add an
exclamation mark to the Ex command, as in &#34;:w!&#34;. The -R option also
implies the -n option (see above). The &#39;readonly&#39; option can be
reset with &#34;:set noro&#34;. See &#34;:help &#39;readonly&#39;&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
-s
</dt>
<dd>Silent mode. Only when started as &#34;Ex&#34; or when the &#34;-e&#34; option
was given before the &#34;-s&#34; option.</dd>
<dt>
-s {scriptin}
</dt>
<dd>The script file {scriptin} is read. The characters
in the file are interpreted as if you had typed them. The same can
be done with the command &#34;:source! {scriptin}&#34;. If the end of the
file is reached before the editor exits, further characters are read
from the keyboard.</dd>
<dt>
-S {file}
</dt>
<dd>{file} will be sourced after the first file has been
read. This is equivalent to -c &#34;source {file}&#34;. {file} cannot start
with &#39;-&#39;. If {file} is omitted &#34;Session.vim&#34; is used (only works
when -S is the last argument).</dd>
<dt>
-T {terminal}
</dt>
<dd>Tells <strong>Vim</strong> the name of the terminal you are using.
Only required when the automatic way doesn&#39;t work. Should be a
terminal known to <strong>Vim</strong> (builtin) or defined in the termcap or
terminfo file.</dd>
<dt>
-u {vimrc}
</dt>
<dd>Use the commands in the file {vimrc} for
initializations. All the other initializations are skipped. Use this
to edit a special kind of files. It can also be used to skip all
initializations by giving the name &#34;NONE&#34;. See &#34;:help
initialization&#34; within vim for more details.</dd>
<dt>
-U {gvimrc}
</dt>
<dd>Use the commands in the file {gvimrc} for GUI
initializations. All the other GUI initializations are skipped. It
can also be used to skip all GUI initializations by giving the name
&#34;NONE&#34;. See &#34;:help gui-init&#34; within vim for more details.</dd>
<dt>
-v
</dt>
<dd>Start <strong>Vim</strong> in Vi mode, just like the executable was called
&#34;vi&#34;. This only has effect when the executable is called &#34;ex&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
-V[N]
</dt>
<dd>Verbose. Give messages about which files are sourced and
for reading and writing a viminfo file. The optional number N is the
value for &#39;verbose&#39;. Default is 10.</dd>
<dt>
-V[N]{filename}
</dt>
<dd>Like -V and set &#39;verbosefile&#39; to {filename}. The
result is that messages are not displayed but written to the file
{filename}. {filename} must not start with a digit.</dd>
<dt>
-w{number}
</dt>
<dd>Set the &#39;window&#39; option to {number}.</dd>
<dt>
-w {scriptout}
</dt>
<dd>All the characters that you type are recorded in
the file {scriptout}, until you exit <strong>Vim.</strong> This is useful if you
want to create a script file to be used with &#34;vim -s&#34; or &#34;:source!&#34;.
If the {scriptout} file exists, characters are appended.</dd>
<dt>
-W {scriptout}
</dt>
<dd>Like -w, but an existing file is overwritten.</dd>
<dt>
-x
</dt>
<dd>If <strong>Vim</strong> has been compiled with encryption support, use
encryption when writing files. Will prompt for a crypt key.</dd>
<dt>
-X
</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t connect to the X server. Shortens startup time in a
terminal, but the window title and clipboard will not be used.</dd>
<dt>
-y
</dt>
<dd>Start <strong>Vim</strong> in easy mode, just like the executable was called
&#34;evim&#34; or &#34;eview&#34;. Makes <strong>Vim</strong> behave like a click-and-type editor.</dd>
<dt>
-Z
</dt>
<dd>Restricted mode. Works like the executable starts with &#34;r&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
–
</dt>
<dd>Denotes the end of the options. Arguments after this will be
handled as a file name. This can be used to edit a filename that
starts with a &#39;-&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
–clean
</dt>
<dd>Do not use any personal configuration (vimrc, plugins,
etc.). Useful to see if a problem reproduces with a clean Vim setup.</dd>
<dt>
–cmd {command}
</dt>
<dd>Like using &#34;-c&#34;, but the command is executed just
before processing any vimrc file. You can use up to 10 of these
commands, independently from &#34;-c&#34; commands.</dd>
<dt>
–echo-wid
</dt>
<dd>GTK GUI only: Echo the Window ID on stdout.</dd>
<dt>
–gui-dialog-file {name}
</dt>
<dd>When using the GUI, instead of showing a
dialog, write the title and message of the dialog to file {name}.
The file is created or appended to. Only useful for testing, to
avoid that the test gets stuck on a dialog that can&#39;t be seen.
Without the GUI the argument is ignored.</dd>
<dt>
–help, -h, -?
</dt>
<dd>Give a bit of help about the command line
arguments and options. After this <strong>Vim</strong> exits.</dd>
<dt>
–literal
</dt>
<dd>Take file name arguments literally, do not expand
wildcards. This has no effect on Unix where the shell expands
wildcards.</dd>
<dt>
–log {filename}
</dt>
<dd>If <strong>Vim</strong> has been compiled with eval and channel
feature, start logging and write entries to {filename}. This works
like calling <em>ch_logfile({filename}, &#39;ao&#39;)</em> very early during
startup.</dd>
<dt>
–nofork
</dt>
<dd>Foreground. For the GUI version, <strong>Vim</strong> will not fork and
detach from the shell it was started in.</dd>
<dt>
–noplugin
</dt>
<dd>Skip loading plugins. Implied by -u NONE.</dd>
<dt>
–not-a-term
</dt>
<dd>Tells <strong>Vim</strong> that the user knows that the input
and/or output is not connected to a terminal. This will avoid the
warning and the two second delay that would happen.</dd>
<dt>
–remote
</dt>
<dd>Connect to a Vim server and make it edit the files given
in the rest of the arguments. If no server is found a warning is
given and the files are edited in the current Vim.</dd>
<dt>
–remote-expr {expr}
</dt>
<dd>Connect to a Vim server, evaluate {expr} in
it and print the result on stdout.</dd>
<dt>
–remote-send {keys}
</dt>
<dd>Connect to a Vim server and send {keys} to
it.</dd>
<dt>
–remote-silent
</dt>
<dd>As –remote, but without the warning when no
server is found.</dd>
<dt>
–remote-wait
</dt>
<dd>As –remote, but Vim does not exit until the files
have been edited.</dd>
<dt>
–remote-wait-silent
</dt>
<dd>As –remote-wait, but without the warning
when no server is found.</dd>
<dt>
–serverlist
</dt>
<dd>List the names of all Vim servers that can be found.</dd>
<dt>
–servername {name}
</dt>
<dd>Use {name} as the server name. Used for the
current Vim, unless used with a –remote argument, then it&#39;s the
name of the server to connect to.</dd>
<dt>
–socketid {id}
</dt>
<dd>GTK GUI only: Use the GtkPlug mechanism to run
gVim in another window.</dd>
<dt>
–startuptime {file}
</dt>
<dd>During startup write timing messages to the
file {fname}.</dd>
<dt>
–ttyfail
</dt>
<dd>When stdin or stdout is not a a terminal (tty) then
exit right away.</dd>
<dt>
–version
</dt>
<dd>Print version information and exit.</dd>
<dt>
–windowid {id}
</dt>
<dd>Win32 GUI only: Make gVim try to use the window
{id} as a parent, so that it runs inside that window.</dd>

<p>Most of <strong>Vim</strong> was made by Bram Moolenaar, with a lot of help from

Note that a number of things that may be regarded as bugs by some, are

you think other things are bugs &#34;because Vi does it differently&#34;, you

vi_diff.txt when in Vim). Also have a look at the &#39;compatible&#39; and
&#39;cpoptions&#39; options.</p>
