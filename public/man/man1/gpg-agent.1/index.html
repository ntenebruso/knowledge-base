DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>gpg-agent</strong> is a daemon to manage secret (private) keys independently
from any protocol. It is used as a backend for <strong>gpg</strong> and <strong>gpgsm</strong> as well
as for a couple of other utilities.</p>
<p>
The agent is automatically started on demand by <strong>gpg</strong>, <strong>gpgsm</strong>,
<strong>gpgconf</strong>, or <strong>gpg-connect-agent</strong>. Thus there is no reason to start it
manually. In case you want to use the included Secure Shell Agent you
may start the agent using:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
gpg-connect-agent /bye
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you want to manually terminate the currently-running agent, you can
safely do so with:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
You should always add the following lines to your <strong>.bashrc</strong> or whatever
initialization file is used for all shell invocations:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
GPG_TTY=$(tty)
export GPG_TTY
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is important that this environment variable always reflects the
output of the <strong>tty</strong> command. For W32 systems this option is not
required.</p>
<p>
Please make sure that a proper pinentry program has been installed under
the default filename (which is system dependent) or use the option
<strong>pinentry-program</strong> to specify the full name of that program. It is often
useful to install a symbolic link from the actual used pinentry (e.g.
‘//nix/store/3740w49c73r712d94hl2wx7q3a39b3b0-gnupg-2.4.5/bin/pinentry-gtk/&#39;)
to the expected one (e.g.
‘//nix/store/3740w49c73r712d94hl2wx7q3a39b3b0-gnupg-2.4.5/bin/pinentry/&#39;).</p>

COMMANDS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Commands are not distinguished from options except for the fact that
only one command is allowed.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>–version</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print the program version and licensing information.
Note that you cannot abbreviate this command.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–help</strong><br>
<strong>-h</strong> :: Print a usage message summarizing the most useful command-line
options. Note that you cannot abbreviate this command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–dump-options</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print a list of all available options and
commands. Note that you cannot abbreviate this command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–server</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Run in server mode and wait for commands on the <strong>stdin</strong>.
The default mode is to create a socket and listen for commands there.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–daemon [/command/ line]</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Start the gpg-agent as a daemon; that
is, detach it from the console and run it in the background.

As an alternative you may create a new process as a child of
gpg-agent: <strong>gpg-agent –daemon /bin/sh</strong>. This way you get a new shell
with the environment setup properly; after you exit from this shell,
gpg-agent terminates within a few seconds.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–supervised</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Run in the foreground, sending logs by default to
stderr, and listening on provided file descriptors, which must already
be bound to listening sockets. This option is deprecated and not
supported on Windows.

If in ‘/common.conf/&#39; the option <strong>no-autostart</strong> is set, any start
attempts will be ignored.

In –supervised mode, different file descriptors can be provided for
use as different socket types (e.g. ssh, extra) as long as they are
identified in the environment variable <strong>LISTEN_FDNAMES</strong> (see
sd_listen_fds(3) on some Linux distributions for more information on
this convention).</dd>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Options may either be used on the command line or, after stripping off
the two leading dashes, in the configuration file.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>–options <em>file</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Reads configuration from <em>file</em> instead of from
the default per-user configuration file. The default configuration
file is named ‘/gpg-agent.conf/&#39; and expected in the ‘/.gnupg/&#39;
directory directly below the home directory of the user. This option
is ignored if used in an options file.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–homedir <em>dir</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set the name of the home directory to <em>dir</em>. If
this option is not used, the home directory defaults to ‘/~/.gnupg/&#39;.
It is only recognized when given on the command line. It also
overrides any home directory stated through the environment variable
‘/GNUPGHOME/&#39; or (on Windows systems) by means of the Registry entry
<em>HKCU§oftware\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir</em>.

On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable
application. In this case only this command line option is considered,
all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>-v</strong><br>
<strong>–verbose</strong> :: Outputs additional information while running. You can
increase the verbosity by giving several verbose commands to
<strong>gpg-agent</strong>, such as ‘-vv&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>-q</strong><br>
<strong>–quiet</strong> :: Try to be as quiet as possible.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–batch</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t invoke a pinentry or do any other thing requiring
human interaction.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–faked-system-time <em>epoch</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option is only useful for
testing; it sets the system time back or forth to <em>epoch</em> which is the
number of seconds elapsed since the year 1970.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–debug-level <em>level</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Select the debug level for investigating
problems. <em>level</em> may be a numeric value or a keyword:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>none</strong>
</dt>
<dd>No debugging at all. A value of less than 1 may be used
instead of the keyword.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>basic</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Some basic debug messages. A value between 1 and 2 may be
used instead of the keyword.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>advanced</strong>
</dt>
<dd>More verbose debug messages. A value between 3 and 5 may
be used instead of the keyword.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>expert</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Even more detailed messages. A value between 6 and 8 may
be used instead of the keyword.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>guru</strong>
</dt>
<dd>All of the debug messages you can get. A value greater than
8 may be used instead of the keyword. The creation of hash tracing
files is only enabled if the keyword is used.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
How these messages are mapped to the actual debugging flags is not
specified and may change with newer releases of this program. They are
however carefully selected to best aid in debugging.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>–debug <em>flags</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set debug flags. All flags are or-ed and <em>flags</em>
may be given in C syntax (e.g. 0x0042) or as a comma separated list of
flag names. To get a list of all supported flags the single word
&#34;help&#34; can be used. This option is only useful for debugging and the
behavior may change at any time without notice.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–debug-all</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Same as <strong>–debug=0xffffffff</strong></dd>
<dt>
<strong>–debug-wait <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>When running in server mode, wait <em>n</em> seconds
before entering the actual processing loop and print the pid. This
gives time to attach a debugger.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–debug-quick-random</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option inhibits the use of the very
secure random quality level (Libgcrypt&#39;s <strong>GCRY_VERY_STRONG_RANDOM</strong>)
and degrades all request down to standard random quality. It is only
used for testing and should not be used for any production quality
keys. This option is only effective when given on the command line.

On GNU/Linux, another way to quickly generate insecure keys is to use
<strong>rngd</strong> to fill the kernel&#39;s entropy pool with lower quality random
data. <strong>rngd</strong> is typically provided by the <strong>rng-tools</strong> package. It can
be run as follows: ‘sudo rngd -f -r /dev/urandom&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–debug-pinentry</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option enables extra debug information
pertaining to the Pinentry. As of now it is only useful when used
along with <strong>–debug 1024</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-detach</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t detach the process from the console. This is
mainly useful for debugging.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–steal-socket</strong>
</dt>
<dd>In <strong>–daemon</strong> mode, gpg-agent detects an already
running gpg-agent and does not allow one to start a new instance. This
option can be used to override this check: the new gpg-agent process
will try to take over the communication sockets from the already
running process and start anyway. This option should in general not be
used.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>-s</strong><br>
<strong>–sh</strong><br>
<strong>-c</strong><br>
<strong>–csh</strong> :: Format the info output in daemon mode for use with the
standard Bourne shell or the C-shell respectively. The default is to
guess it based on the environment variable <strong>SHELL</strong> which is correct in
almost all cases.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–grab</strong><br>
<strong>–no-grab</strong> :: Tell the pinentry to grab the keyboard and mouse. This
option should be used on X-Servers to avoid X-sniffing attacks. Any
use of the option <strong>–grab</strong> overrides an used option <strong>–no-grab</strong>. The
default is <strong>–no-grab</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–log-file <em>file</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Append all logging output to <em>file</em>. This is
very helpful in seeing what the agent actually does. Use ‘/socket:///&#39;
to log to socket. If neither a log file nor a log file descriptor has
been set on a Windows platform, the Registry entry
<strong>HKCU§oftware\GNU\GnuPG:DefaultLogFile</strong>, if set, is used to specify
the logging output.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-allow-mark-trusted</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Do not allow clients to mark keys as
trusted, i.e. put them into the ‘/trustlist.txt/&#39; file. This makes it
harder for users to inadvertently accept Root-CA keys.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-user-trustlist</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Entirely ignore the user trust list and
consider only the global trustlist (‘//etc/gnupg/trustlist.txt/&#39;).
This implies the [option –no-allow-mark-trusted].</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–sys-trustlist-name <em>file</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Changes the default name for the
global trustlist from &#34;trustlist.txt&#34; to <em>file</em>. If <em>file</em> does not
contain any slashes and does not start with &#34;~/&#34; it is searched in the
system configuration directory (‘//etc/gnupg/&#39;).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–allow-preset-passphrase</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option allows the use of
<strong>gpg-preset-passphrase</strong> to seed the internal cache of <strong>gpg-agent</strong> with
passphrases.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-allow-loopback-pinentry</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>–allow-loopback-pinentry</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Disallow
or allow clients to use the loopback pinentry features; see the
option <strong>pinentry-mode</strong> for details. Allow is the default.

The <strong>–force</strong> option of the Assuan command <strong>DELETE_KEY</strong> is also
controlled by this option: The option is ignored if a loopback
pinentry is disallowed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-allow-external-cache</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Tell Pinentry not to enable features
which use an external cache for passphrases.

Some desktop environments prefer to unlock all credentials with one
master password and may have installed a Pinentry which employs an
additional external cache to implement such a policy. By using this
option the Pinentry is advised not to make use of such a cache and
instead always ask the user for the requested passphrase.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–allow-emacs-pinentry</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Tell Pinentry to allow features to divert
the passphrase entry to a running Emacs instance. How this is exactly
handled depends on the version of the used Pinentry.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–ignore-cache-for-signing</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option will let <strong>gpg-agent</strong>
bypass the passphrase cache for all signing operation. Note that there
is also a per-session option to control this behavior but this command
line option takes precedence.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–default-cache-ttl <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set the time a cache entry is valid to
<em>n</em> seconds. The default is 600 seconds. Each time a cache entry is
accessed, the entry&#39;s timer is reset. To set an entry&#39;s maximum
lifetime, use <strong>max-cache-ttl</strong>. Note that a cached passphrase may not
be evicted immediately from memory if no client requests a cache
operation. This is due to an internal housekeeping function which is
only run every few seconds.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–default-cache-ttl-ssh <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set the time a cache entry used for
SSH keys is valid to <em>n</em> seconds. The default is 1800 seconds. Each
time a cache entry is accessed, the entry&#39;s timer is reset. To set an
entry&#39;s maximum lifetime, use <strong>max-cache-ttl-ssh</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–max-cache-ttl <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set the maximum time a cache entry is valid
to <em>n</em> seconds. After this time a cache entry will be expired even if
it has been accessed recently or has been set using
<strong>gpg-preset-passphrase</strong>. The default is 2 hours (7200 seconds).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–max-cache-ttl-ssh <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set the maximum time a cache entry used
for SSH keys is valid to <em>n</em> seconds. After this time a cache entry
will be expired even if it has been accessed recently or has been set
using <strong>gpg-preset-passphrase</strong>. The default is 2 hours (7200 seconds).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–enforce-passphrase-constraints</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Enforce the passphrase
constraints by not allowing the user to bypass them using the ``Take
it anyway&#39;&#39; button.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–min-passphrase-len <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set the minimal length of a passphrase.
When entering a new passphrase shorter than this value a warning will
be displayed. Defaults to 8.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–min-passphrase-nonalpha <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set the minimal number of digits or
special characters required in a passphrase. When entering a new
passphrase with less than this number of digits or special characters
a warning will be displayed. Defaults to 1.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–check-passphrase-pattern <em>file</em></strong><br>
<strong>–check-sym-passphrase-pattern <em>file</em></strong> :: Check the passphrase
against the pattern given in <em>file</em>. When entering a new passphrase
matching one of these pattern a warning will be displayed. If <em>file</em>
does not contain any slashes and does not start with &#34;~/&#34; it is
searched in the system configuration directory (‘//etc/gnupg/&#39;). The
default is not to use any pattern file. The second version of this
option is only used when creating a new symmetric key to allow the use
of different patterns for such passphrases.

Security note: It is known that checking a passphrase against a list
of pattern or even against a complete dictionary is not very effective
to enforce good passphrases. Users will soon figure up ways to bypass
such a policy. A better policy is to educate users on good security
behavior and optionally to run a passphrase cracker regularly on all
users passphrases to catch the very simple ones.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–max-passphrase-days <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Ask the user to change the passphrase
if <em>n</em> days have passed since the last change. With
<strong>–enforce-passphrase-constraints</strong> set the user may not bypass this
check.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–enable-passphrase-history</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option does nothing yet.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–pinentry-invisible-char <em>char</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option asks the Pinentry to
use <em>char</em> for displaying hidden characters. <em>char</em> must be one
character UTF-8 string. A Pinentry may or may not honor this request.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–pinentry-timeout <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option asks the Pinentry to timeout
after <em>n</em> seconds with no user input. The default value of 0 does not
ask the pinentry to timeout, however a Pinentry may use its own
default timeout value in this case. A Pinentry may or may not honor
this request.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–pinentry-formatted-passphrase</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option asks the Pinentry to
enable passphrase formatting when asking the user for a new passphrase
and masking of the passphrase is turned off.

If passphrase formatting is enabled, then all non-breaking space
characters are stripped from the entered passphrase. Passphrase
formatting is mostly useful in combination with passphrases generated
with the GENPIN feature of some Pinentries. Note that such a generated
passphrase, if not modified by the user, skips all passphrase
constraints checking because such constraints would actually weaken
the generated passphrase.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–pinentry-program <em>filename</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use program <em>filename</em> as the PIN
entry. The default is installation dependent. With the default
configuration the name of the default pinentry is ‘/pinentry/&#39;; if
that file does not exist but a ‘/pinentry-basic/&#39; exist the latter is
used.

On a Windows platform the default is to use the first existing program
from this list: ‘/binπnentry.exe/&#39;, ‘/..\Gpg4win\binπnentry.exe/&#39;,
‘/..\Gpg4winπnentry.exe/&#39;, ‘/..\GNU\GnuPGπnentry.exe/&#39;,
‘/..\GNU\binπnentry.exe/&#39;, ‘/binπnentry-basic.exe/&#39; where the file
names are relative to the GnuPG installation directory.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–pinentry-touch-file <em>filename</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>By default the filename of the
socket gpg-agent is listening for requests is passed to Pinentry, so
that it can touch that file before exiting (it does this only in
curses mode). This option changes the file passed to Pinentry to
<em>filename</em>. The special name <strong>/dev/null</strong> may be used to completely
disable this feature. Note that Pinentry will not create that file, it
will only change the modification and access time.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–scdaemon-program <em>filename</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use program <em>filename</em> as the
Smartcard daemon. The default is installation dependent and can be
shown with the <strong>gpgconf</strong> command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–disable-scdaemon</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Do not make use of the scdaemon tool. This
option has the effect of disabling the ability to do smartcard
operations. Note, that enabling this option at runtime does not kill
an already forked scdaemon.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–disable-check-own-socket</strong>
</dt>
<dd><strong>gpg-agent</strong> employs a periodic
self-test to detect a stolen socket. This usually means a second
instance of <strong>gpg-agent</strong> has taken over the socket and <strong>gpg-agent</strong> will
then terminate itself. This option may be used to disable this
self-test for debugging purposes.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–use-standard-socket</strong><br>
<strong>–no-use-standard-socket</strong><br>
<strong>–use-standard-socket-p</strong> :: Since GnuPG 2.1 the standard socket is
always used. These options have no more effect. The command
<strong>gpg-agent</strong> –use-standard-socket-p will thus always return success.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–display <em>string</em></strong><br>
<strong>–ttyname <em>string</em></strong><br>
<strong>–ttytype <em>string</em></strong><br>
<strong>–lc-ctype <em>string</em></strong><br>
<strong>–lc-messages <em>string</em></strong><br>
<strong>–xauthority <em>string</em></strong> :: These options are used with the server mode
to pass localization information.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–keep-tty</strong><br>
<strong>–keep-display</strong> :: Ignore requests to change the current <strong>tty</strong> or X
window system&#39;s <strong>DISPLAY</strong> variable respectively. This is useful to
lock the pinentry to pop up at the <strong>tty</strong> or display you started the
agent.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–listen-backlog <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set the size of the queue for pending
connections. The default is 64.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–extra-socket <em>name</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>The extra socket is created by default, you
may use this option to change the name of the socket. To disable the
creation of the socket use ``none&#39;&#39; or ``/dev/null&#39;&#39; for <em>name</em>.

Also listen on native gpg-agent connections on the given socket. The
intended use for this extra socket is to setup a Unix domain socket
forwarding from a remote machine to this socket on the local machine.
A <strong>gpg</strong> running on the remote machine may then connect to the local
gpg-agent and use its private keys. This enables decrypting or signing
data on a remote machine without exposing the private keys to the
remote machine.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–enable-extended-key-format</strong><br>
<strong>–disable-extended-key-format</strong> :: These options are obsolete and have
no effect. The extended key format is used for years now and has been
supported since 2.1.12. Existing keys in the old format are migrated
to the new format as soon as they are touched.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>–enable-ssh-support</strong><br>
<strong>–enable-win32-openssh-support</strong><br>
<strong>–enable-putty-support</strong> :: On Unix platforms the OpenSSH Agent
protocol is always enabled, but <strong>gpg-agent</strong> will only set the
<strong>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</strong> variable if the option <strong>enable-ssh-support</strong> is given.
Some Linux distributions use the presence of this option to decide
whether the old ssh-agent shall be started.

On Windows support for the native ssh implementation must be enabled
using the the option <strong>enable-win32-openssh-support</strong>. For using
gpg-agent as a replacement for PuTTY&#39;s Pageant, the option
<strong>enable-putty-support</strong> must be enabled.

In this mode of operation, the agent does not only implement the
gpg-agent protocol, but also the agent protocol used by OpenSSH
(through a separate socket or via Named Pipes) or the protocol used by
PuTTY. Consequently, this allows one to use the gpg-agent as a drop-in
replacement for the ssh-agent.

SSH keys, which are to be used through the agent, need to be added to
the gpg-agent initially through the ssh-add utility. When a key is
added, ssh-add will ask for the password of the provided key file and
send the unprotected key material to the agent; this causes the
gpg-agent to ask for a passphrase, which is to be used for encrypting
the newly received key and storing it in a gpg-agent specific
directory.

Once a key has been added to the gpg-agent this way, the gpg-agent
will be ready to use the key.

Note: in case the gpg-agent receives a signature request, the user
might need to be prompted for a passphrase, which is necessary for
decrypting the stored key. Since the ssh-agent protocol does not
contain a mechanism for telling the agent on which display/terminal it
is running, gpg-agent&#39;s ssh-support will use the TTY or X display
where gpg-agent has been started. To switch this display to the
current one, the following command may be used:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Although all GnuPG components try to start the gpg-agent as needed, this
is not possible for the ssh support because ssh does not know about it.
Thus if no GnuPG tool which accesses the agent has been run, there is no
guarantee that ssh is able to use gpg-agent for authentication. To fix
this you may start gpg-agent if needed using this simple command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
gpg-connect-agent /bye
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Adding the <strong>–verbose</strong> shows the progress of starting the agent.</p>
<p>
The <strong>–enable-putty-support</strong> is only available under Windows and allows
the use of gpg-agent with the ssh implementation <strong>putty</strong>. This is
similar to the regular ssh-agent support but makes use of Windows
message queue as required by <strong>putty</strong>.</p>
<p>
The order in which keys are presented to ssh are:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Negative Use-for-ssh values</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If a key file has the attribute
&#34;Use-for-ssh&#34; and its value is negative, these keys are presented
first to ssh. The negative values are capped at -999 with -999 being
lower ranked than -1. These values can be used to prefer on-disk keys
over keys taken from active cards.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Active cards</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Active cards (inserted into a card reader or plugged
in tokens) are always tried; they are ordered by their serial numbers.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Keys listed in the sshcontrol file</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Non-disabled keys from the
sshcontrol file are presented in the order they appear in this file.
Note that the sshcontrol file is deprecated.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Positive Use-for-ssh values</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If a key file has the attribute
&#34;Use-for-ssh&#34; and its value is &#34;yes&#34;, &#34;true&#34;, or any positive number
the key is presented in the order of their values. &#34;yes&#34; and &#34;true&#34;
have a value of 1; other values are capped at 99999.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
Editing the &#34;Use-for-ssh&#34; values can be done with an editor or using
<strong>gpg-connect-agent</strong> and &#34;KEYATTR&#34; (Remember to append a colon to the
key; i.e. use &#34;Use-for-ssh:&#34;).</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>–ssh-fingerprint-digest</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Select the digest algorithm used to
compute ssh fingerprints that are communicated to the user, e.g. in
pinentry dialogs. OpenSSH has transitioned from using MD5 to the more
secure SHA256.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–auto-expand-secmem <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Allow Libgcrypt to expand its secure
memory area as required. The optional value <em>n</em> is a non-negative
integer with a suggested size in bytes of each additionally allocated
secure memory area. The value is rounded up to the next 32 KiB; usual
C style prefixes are allowed. For an heavy loaded gpg-agent with many
concurrent connection this option avoids sign or decrypt errors due to
out of secure memory error returns.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–s2k-calibration <em>milliseconds</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Change the default calibration
time to <em>milliseconds</em>. The given value is capped at 60 seconds; a
value of 0 resets to the compiled-in default. This option is re-read
on a SIGHUP (or <strong>gpgconf</strong> –reload gpg-agent) and the S2K count is
then re-calibrated.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–s2k-count <em>n</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specify the iteration count used to protect the
passphrase. This option can be used to override the auto-calibration
done by default. The auto-calibration computes a count which requires
by default 100ms to mangle a given passphrase. See also
<strong>–s2k-calibration</strong>.

To view the actually used iteration count and the milliseconds
required for an S2K operation use:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
gpg-connect-agent &#39;GETINFO s2k_count&#39; /bye
gpg-connect-agent &#39;GETINFO s2k_time&#39; /bye
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="example">

EXAMPLES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>It is important to set the environment variable <strong>GPG_TTY</strong> in your login

<p>
If you enabled the Ssh Agent Support, you also need to tell ssh about it
by adding this to your init script:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
unset SSH_AGENT_PID

<p>There are a few configuration files needed for the operation of the
agent. By default they may all be found in the current home directory
(see: [option –homedir]).</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>gpg-agent.conf</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is the standard configuration file read by
<strong>gpg-agent</strong> on startup. It may contain any valid long option; the
leading two dashes may not be entered and the option may not be
abbreviated. This file is also read after a <strong>SIGHUP</strong> however only a
few options will actually have an effect. This default name may be
changed on the command line (see: [option –options]). You should
backup this file.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>trustlist.txt</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is the list of trusted keys. You should backup
this file.

Comment lines, indicated by a leading hash mark, as well as empty
lines are ignored. To mark a key as trusted you need to enter its
fingerprint followed by a space and a capital letter <strong>S</strong>. Colons may
optionally be used to separate the bytes of a fingerprint; this
enables cutting and pasting the fingerprint from a key listing output.
If the line is prefixed with a <strong>!</strong> the key is explicitly marked as not
trusted.

Here is an example where two keys are marked as ultimately trusted and
one as not trusted:

.RS 2</dd>
</dl>
<pre class="example">
  # CN=Wurzel ZS 3,O=Intevation GmbH,C=DE
  A6935DD34EF3087973C706FC311AA2CCF733765B S

  # CN=PCA-1-Verwaltung-02/O=PKI-1-Verwaltung/C=DE
  DC:BD:69:25:48:BD:BB:7E:31:6E:BB:80:D3:00:80:35:D4:F8:A6:CD S

  # CN=Root-CA/O=Schlapphuete/L=Pullach/C=DE
  !14:56:98:D3:FE:9C:CA:5A:31:6E:BC:81:D3:11:4E:00:90:A3:44:C2 S
  .fi
  
Before entering a key into this file, you need to ensure its
authenticity.  How to do this depends on your organisation; your
administrator might have already entered those keys which are deemed
trustworthy enough into this file.  Places where to look for the
fingerprint of a root certificate are letters received from the CA or
the website of the CA (after making 100% sure that this is indeed the
website of that CA).  You may want to consider disallowing interactive
updates of this file by using the [option --no-allow-mark-trusted].
It might even be advisable to change the permissions to read-only so
that this file can&#39;t be changed inadvertently.

As a special feature a line include-default will include a global
list of trusted certificates (e.g. ‘/etc/gnupg/trustlist.txt’).
This global list is also used if the local list is not available;
the [option --no-user-trustlist] enforces the use of only
this global list.

It is possible to add further flags after the S for use by the
caller:


relax
Relax checking of some root certificate requirements.  As of now this
flag allows the use of root certificates with a missing basicConstraints
attribute (despite that it is a MUST for CA certificates) and disables
CRL checking for the root certificate.

cm
If validation of a certificate finally issued by a CA with this flag set
fails, try again using the chain validation model.

qual
The CA is allowed to issue certificates for qualified signatures.
This flag has an effect only if used in the global list.  This is now
the preferred way to mark such CA; the old way of having a separate
file ‘qualified.txt’ is still supported.

de-vs
The CA is part of an approved PKI for the German classification level
VS-NfD.  It is only valid in the global trustlist.  As of now this is
used only for documentation purpose.



sshcontrol
This file is used when support for the secure shell agent protocol has
been enabled (see: [option --enable-ssh-support]). Only keys present in
this file are used in the SSH protocol.  You should backup this file.

This file is deprecated in favor of the &#34;Use-for-ssh&#34; attribute in the
key files.

The ssh-add tool may be used to add new entries to this file;
you may also add them manually.  Comment lines, indicated by a leading
hash mark, as well as empty lines are ignored.  An entry starts with
optional whitespace, followed by the keygrip of the key given as 40 hex
digits, optionally followed by the caching TTL in seconds and another
optional field for arbitrary flags.  A non-zero TTL overrides the global
default as set by --default-cache-ttl-ssh.

The only flag support is confirm.  If this flag is found for a
key, each use of the key will pop up a pinentry to confirm the use of
that key.  The flag is automatically set if a new key was loaded into
gpg-agent using the option -c of the ssh-add
command.

The keygrip may be prefixed with a ! to disable an entry.

The following example lists exactly one key.  Note that keys available
through a OpenPGP smartcard in the active smartcard reader are
implicitly added to this list; i.e. there is no need to list them.

       # Key added on: 2011-07-20 20:38:46
       # Fingerprint:  5e:8d:c4:ad:e7:af:6e:27:8a:d6:13:e4:79:ad:0b:81
       34B62F25E277CF13D3C6BCEBFD3F85D08F0A864B 0 confirm
</pre>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>private-keys-v1.d/</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is the directory where gpg-agent stores
the private keys. Each key is stored in a file with the name made up
of the keygrip and the suffix ‘/key/&#39;. You should backup all files in
this directory and take great care to keep this backup closed away.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that on larger installations, it is useful to put predefined files
into the directory ‘//etc/skel/.gnupg/&#39; so that newly created users
start up with a working configuration. For existing users the a small
helper script is provided to create these files (see: [addgnupghome]).</p>

SIGNALS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>A running <strong>gpg-agent</strong> may be controlled by signals, i.e. using the
<strong>kill</strong> command to send a signal to the process.</p>
<p>
Here is a list of supported signals:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>SIGHUP</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This signal flushes all cached passphrases and if the
program has been started with a configuration file, the configuration
file is read again. Only certain options are honored: <strong>quiet</strong>,
<strong>verbose</strong>, <strong>debug</strong>, <strong>debug-all</strong>, <strong>debug-level</strong>, <strong>debug-pinentry</strong>,
<strong>no-grab</strong>, <strong>pinentry-program</strong>, <strong>pinentry-invisible-char</strong>,
<strong>default-cache-ttl</strong>, <strong>max-cache-ttl</strong>, <strong>ignore-cache-for-signing</strong>,
<strong>s2k-count</strong>, <strong>no-allow-external-cache</strong>, <strong>allow-emacs-pinentry</strong>,
<strong>no-allow-mark-trusted</strong>, <strong>disable-scdaemon</strong>, and
<strong>disable-check-own-socket</strong>. <strong>scdaemon-program</strong> is also supported but
due to the current implementation, which calls the scdaemon only once,
it is not of much use unless you manually kill the scdaemon.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SIGTERM</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Shuts down the process but waits until all current
requests are fulfilled. If the process has received 3 of these signals
and requests are still pending, a shutdown is forced.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SIGINT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Shuts down the process immediately.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SIGUSR1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Dump internal information to the log file.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SIGUSR2</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This signal is used for internal purposes.</dd>
