DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Runs a number of housekeeping tasks within the current repository, such
as compressing file revisions (to reduce disk space and increase
performance), removing unreachable objects which may have been created
from prior invocations of <em>git add</em>, packing refs, pruning reflog,
rerere metadata or stale working trees. May also update ancillary
indexes such as the commit-graph.</p>
<p>
When common porcelain operations that create objects are run, they will
check whether the repository has grown substantially since the last
maintenance, and if so run <strong>git gc</strong> automatically. See <strong>gc.auto</strong> below
for how to disable this behavior.</p>
<p>
Running <strong>git gc</strong> manually should only be needed when adding objects to a
repository without regularly running such porcelain commands, to do a
one-off repository optimization, or e.g. to clean up a suboptimal
mass-import. See the &#34;PACKFILE OPTIMIZATION&#34; section in
*git-fast-import*(1) for more details on the import case.</p>

<h2 id="headline-4">
OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>–aggressive</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Usually <em>git gc</em> runs very quickly while providing good disk space
utilization and performance. This option will cause <em>git gc</em> to more
aggressively optimize the repository at the expense of taking much more
time. The effects of this optimization are mostly persistent. See the
&#34;AGGRESSIVE&#34; section below for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–auto</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With this option, <em>git gc</em> checks whether any housekeeping is required;
if not, it exits without performing any work.</p>
<p>
See the <strong>gc.auto</strong> option in the &#34;CONFIGURATION&#34; section below for how
this heuristic works.</p>
<p>
Once housekeeping is triggered by exceeding the limits of configuration
options such as <strong>gc.auto</strong> and <strong>gc.autoPackLimit</strong>, all other housekeeping
tasks (e.g. rerere, working trees, reflog…) will be performed as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]cruft</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When expiring unreachable objects, pack them separately into a cruft
pack instead of storing them as loose objects. <strong>–cruft</strong> is on by
default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–max-cruft-size=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When packing unreachable objects into a cruft pack, limit the size of
new cruft packs to be at most <strong>&lt;n&gt;</strong> bytes. Overrides any value specified
via the <strong>gc.maxCruftSize</strong> configuration. See the <strong>–max-cruft-size</strong>
option of *git-repack*(1) for more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–prune=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prune loose objects older than date (default is 2 weeks ago, overridable
by the config variable <strong>gc.pruneExpire</strong>). –prune=now prunes loose
objects regardless of their age and increases the risk of corruption if
another process is writing to the repository concurrently; see &#34;NOTES&#34;
below. –prune is on by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-prune</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not prune any loose objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–quiet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppress all progress reports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–force</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Force <strong>git gc</strong> to run even if there may be another <strong>git gc</strong> instance
running on this repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–keep-largest-pack</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All packs except the largest non-cruft pack, any packs marked with a
<strong>.keep</strong> file, and any cruft pack(s) are consolidated into a single pack.
When this option is used, <strong>gc.bigPackThreshold</strong> is ignored.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="headline-5">
AGGRESSIVE
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When the <strong>–aggressive</strong> option is supplied, <strong>git-repack*(1) will be
invoked with the *-f</strong> flag, which in turn will pass <strong>–no-reuse-delta</strong>
to *git-pack-objects*(1). This will throw away any existing deltas and
re-compute them, at the expense of spending much more time on the
repacking.</p>
<p>
The effects of this are mostly persistent, e.g. when packs and loose
objects are coalesced into one another pack the existing deltas in that
pack might get re-used, but there are also various cases where we might
pick a sub-optimal delta from a newer pack instead.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, supplying <strong>–aggressive</strong> will tweak the <strong>–depth</strong> and
<strong>–window</strong> options passed to <strong>git-repack*(1). See the
*gc.aggressiveDepth</strong> and <strong>gc.aggressiveWindow</strong> settings below. By using
a larger window size we&#39;re more likely to find more optimal deltas.</p>
<p>
It&#39;s probably not worth it to use this option on a given repository
without running tailored performance benchmarks on it. It takes a lot
more time, and the resulting space/delta optimization may or may not be
worth it. Not using this at all is the right trade-off for most users
and their repositories.</p>

CONFIGURATION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Everything below this line in this section is selectively included from
the *git-config*(1) documentation. The content is the same as what&#39;s
found there:</p>
<p>
gc.aggressiveDepth</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The depth parameter used in the delta compression algorithm used by <em>git
gc –aggressive</em>. This defaults to 50, which is the default for the
<strong>–depth</strong> option when <strong>–aggressive</strong> isn&#39;t in use.</p>
<p>
See the documentation for the <strong>–depth</strong> option in *git-repack*(1) for
more details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.aggressiveWindow</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The window size parameter used in the delta compression algorithm used
by <em>git gc –aggressive</em>. This defaults to 250, which is a much more
aggressive window size than the default <strong>–window</strong> of 10.</p>
<p>
See the documentation for the <strong>–window</strong> option in *git-repack*(1) for
more details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.auto</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When there are approximately more than this many loose objects in the
repository, <strong>git gc –auto</strong> will pack them. Some Porcelain commands use
this command to perform a light-weight garbage collection from time to
time. The default value is 6700.</p>
<p>
Setting this to 0 disables not only automatic packing based on the
number of loose objects, but also any other heuristic <strong>git gc –auto</strong>
will otherwise use to determine if there&#39;s work to do, such as
<strong>gc.autoPackLimit</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.autoPackLimit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When there are more than this many packs that are not marked with
<strong>*.keep</strong> file in the repository, <strong>git gc –auto</strong> consolidates them into
one larger pack. The default value is 50. Setting this to 0 disables it.
Setting <strong>gc.auto</strong> to 0 will also disable this.</p>
<p>
See the <strong>gc.bigPackThreshold</strong> configuration variable below. When in use,
it&#39;ll affect how the auto pack limit works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.autoDetach</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make <strong>git gc –auto</strong> return immediately and run in the background if the
system supports it. Default is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.bigPackThreshold</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If non-zero, all non-cruft packs larger than this limit are kept when
<strong>git gc</strong> is run. This is very similar to <strong>–keep-largest-pack</strong> except
that all non-cruft packs that meet the threshold are kept, not just the
largest pack. Defaults to zero. Common unit suffixes of <em>k</em>, <em>m</em>, or <em>g</em>
are supported.</p>
<p>
Note that if the number of kept packs is more than gc.autoPackLimit,
this configuration variable is ignored, all packs except the base pack
will be repacked. After this the number of packs should go below
gc.autoPackLimit and gc.bigPackThreshold should be respected again.</p>
<p>
If the amount of memory estimated for <strong>git repack</strong> to run smoothly is
not available and <strong>gc.bigPackThreshold</strong> is not set, the largest pack
will also be excluded (this is the equivalent of running <strong>git gc</strong> with
<strong>–keep-largest-pack</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.writeCommitGraph</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, then gc will rewrite the commit-graph file when <strong>git-gc*(1) is
run. When using *git gc –auto</strong> the commit-graph will be updated if
housekeeping is required. Default is true. See *git-commit-graph*(1) for
details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.logExpiry</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the file gc.log exists, then <strong>git gc –auto</strong> will print its content
and exit with status zero instead of running unless that file is more
than <em>gc.logExpiry</em> old. Default is &#34;1.day&#34;. See <strong>gc.pruneExpire</strong> for
more ways to specify its value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.packRefs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Running <strong>git pack-refs</strong> in a repository renders it unclonable by Git
versions prior to 1.5.1.2 over dumb transports such as HTTP. This
variable determines whether <em>git gc</em> runs <strong>git pack-refs</strong>. This can be
set to <strong>notbare</strong> to enable it within all non-bare repos or it can be set
to a boolean value. The default is <strong>true</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.cruftPacks</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Store unreachable objects in a cruft pack (see <strong>git-repack*(1)) instead
of as loose objects. The default is *true</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.maxCruftSize</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the size of new cruft packs when repacking. When specified in
addition to <strong>–max-cruft-size</strong>, the command line option takes priority.
See the <strong>–max-cruft-size</strong> option of *git-repack*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.pruneExpire</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <em>git gc</em> is run, it will call <em>prune –expire 2.weeks.ago</em> (and
<em>repack –cruft –cruft-expiration 2.weeks.ago</em> if using cruft packs via
<strong>gc.cruftPacks</strong> or <strong>–cruft</strong>). Override the grace period with this
config variable. The value &#34;now&#34; may be used to disable this grace
period and always prune unreachable objects immediately, or &#34;never&#34; may
be used to suppress pruning. This feature helps prevent corruption when
<em>git gc</em> runs concurrently with another process writing to the
repository; see the &#34;NOTES&#34; section of *git-gc*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.worktreePruneExpire</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <em>git gc</em> is run, it calls <em>git worktree prune –expire
3.months.ago</em>. This config variable can be used to set a different grace
period. The value &#34;now&#34; may be used to disable the grace period and
prune <strong>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</strong> immediately, or &#34;never&#34; may be used to
suppress pruning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.reflogExpire, gc.&lt;pattern&gt;.reflogExpire</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>git reflog expire</em> removes reflog entries older than this time;
defaults to 90 days. The value &#34;now&#34; expires all entries immediately,
and &#34;never&#34; suppresses expiration altogether. With &#34;&lt;pattern&gt;&#34; (e.g.
&#34;refs/stash&#34;) in the middle the setting applies only to the refs that
match the &lt;pattern&gt;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.reflogExpireUnreachable, gc.&lt;pattern&gt;.reflogExpireUnreachable</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>git reflog expire</em> removes reflog entries older than this time and are
not reachable from the current tip; defaults to 30 days. The value &#34;now&#34;
expires all entries immediately, and &#34;never&#34; suppresses expiration
altogether. With &#34;&lt;pattern&gt;&#34; (e.g. &#34;refs/stash&#34;) in the middle, the
setting applies only to the refs that match the &lt;pattern&gt;.</p>
<p>
These types of entries are generally created as a result of using <strong>git
commit –amend</strong> or <strong>git rebase</strong> and are the commits prior to the amend
or rebase occurring. Since these changes are not part of the current
project most users will want to expire them sooner, which is why the
default is more aggressive than <strong>gc.reflogExpire</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.recentObjectsHook</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When considering whether or not to remove an object (either when
generating a cruft pack or storing unreachable objects as loose), use
the shell to execute the specified command(s). Interpret their output as
object IDs which Git will consider as &#34;recent&#34;, regardless of their age.
By treating their mtimes as &#34;now&#34;, any objects (and their descendants)
mentioned in the output will be kept regardless of their true age.</p>
<p>
Output must contain exactly one hex object ID per line, and nothing
else. Objects which cannot be found in the repository are ignored.
Multiple hooks are supported, but all must exit successfully, else the
operation (either generating a cruft pack or unpacking unreachable
objects) will be halted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.repackFilter</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When repacking, use the specified filter to move certain objects into a
separate packfile. See the <strong>–filter=&lt;filter-spec&gt;</strong> option of
*git-repack*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.repackFilterTo</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When repacking and using a filter, see <strong>gc.repackFilter</strong>, the specified
location will be used to create the packfile containing the filtered out
objects. <strong>WARNING:</strong> The specified location should be accessible, using
for example the Git alternates mechanism, otherwise the repo could be
considered corrupt by Git as it migh not be able to access the objects
in that packfile. See the <strong>–filter-to=&lt;dir&gt;</strong> option of <strong>git-repack*(1)
and the *objects/info/alternates</strong> section of *gitrepository-layout*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.rerereResolved</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Records of conflicted merge you resolved earlier are kept for this many
days when <em>git rerere gc</em> is run. You can also use more human-readable
&#34;1.month.ago&#34;, etc. The default is 60 days. See *git-rerere*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.rerereUnresolved</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Records of conflicted merge you have not resolved are kept for this many
days when <em>git rerere gc</em> is run. You can also use more human-readable
&#34;1.month.ago&#34;, etc. The default is 15 days. See *git-rerere*(1).</p>

NOTES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p><em>git gc</em> tries very hard not to delete objects that are referenced
anywhere in your repository. In particular, it will keep not only
objects referenced by your current set of branches and tags, but also
objects referenced by the index, remote-tracking branches, reflogs
(which may reference commits in branches that were later amended or
rewound), and anything else in the refs/* namespace. Note that a note
(of the kind created by <em>git notes</em>) attached to an object does not
contribute in keeping the object alive. If you are expecting some
objects to be deleted and they aren&#39;t, check all of those locations and
decide whether it makes sense in your case to remove those references.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, when <em>git gc</em> runs concurrently with another process,
there is a risk of it deleting an object that the other process is using
but hasn&#39;t created a reference to. This may just cause the other process
to fail or may corrupt the repository if the other process later adds a
reference to the deleted object. Git has two features that significantly
mitigate this problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Any object with modification time newer than the <strong>–prune</strong> date is kept,
along with everything reachable from it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Most operations that add an object to the database update the
modification time of the object if it is already present so that #1
applies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, these features fall short of a complete solution, so users who
run commands concurrently have to live with some risk of corruption
(which seems to be low in practice).</p>
