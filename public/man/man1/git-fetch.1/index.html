DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Fetch branches and/or tags (collectively, &#34;refs&#34;) from one or more other
repositories, along with the objects necessary to complete their
histories. Remote-tracking branches are updated (see the description of
&lt;refspec&gt; below for ways to control this behavior).</p>
<p>
By default, any tag that points into the histories being fetched is also
fetched; the effect is to fetch tags that point at branches that you are
interested in. This default behavior can be changed by using the –tags
or –no-tags options or by configuring remote.&lt;name&gt;.tagOpt. By using a
refspec that fetches tags explicitly, you can fetch tags that do not
point into branches you are interested in as well.</p>
<p>
<em>git fetch</em> can fetch from either a single named repository or URL, or
from several repositories at once if &lt;group&gt; is given and there is a
remotes.&lt;group&gt; entry in the configuration file. (See *git-config*(1)).</p>
<p>
When no remote is specified, by default the <strong>origin</strong> remote will be
used, unless there&#39;s an upstream branch configured for the current
branch.</p>
<p>
The names of refs that are fetched, together with the object names they
point at, are written to <strong>.git/FETCH_HEAD</strong>. This information may be used
by scripts or other git commands, such as *git-pull*(1).</p>

<h2 id="headline-4">
OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>–[no-]all</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fetch all remotes. This overrides the configuration variable
<strong>fetch.all</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-a, –append</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Append ref names and object names of fetched refs to the existing
contents of <strong>.git/FETCH_HEAD</strong>. Without this option old data in
<strong>.git/FETCH_HEAD</strong> will be overwritten.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–atomic</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use an atomic transaction to update local refs. Either all refs are
updated, or on error, no refs are updated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–depth=&lt;depth&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit fetching to the specified number of commits from the tip of each
remote branch history. If fetching to a <em>shallow</em> repository created by
<strong>git clone</strong> with <strong>–depth=&lt;depth&gt;</strong> option (see *git-clone*(1)), deepen
or shorten the history to the specified number of commits. Tags for the
deepened commits are not fetched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–deepen=&lt;depth&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similar to –depth, except it specifies the number of commits from the
current shallow boundary instead of from the tip of each remote branch
history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–shallow-since=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to include all
reachable commits after &lt;date&gt;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–shallow-exclude=&lt;revision&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to exclude commits
reachable from a specified remote branch or tag. This option can be
specified multiple times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–unshallow</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the source repository is complete, convert a shallow repository to a
complete one, removing all the limitations imposed by shallow
repositories.</p>
<p>
If the source repository is shallow, fetch as much as possible so that
the current repository has the same history as the source repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–update-shallow</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default when fetching from a shallow repository, <strong>git fetch</strong> refuses
refs that require updating .git/shallow. This option updates
.git/shallow and accepts such refs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–negotiation-tip=&lt;commit|glob&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, Git will report, to the server, commits reachable from all
local refs to find common commits in an attempt to reduce the size of
the to-be-received packfile. If specified, Git will only report commits
reachable from the given tips. This is useful to speed up fetches when
the user knows which local ref is likely to have commits in common with
the upstream ref being fetched.</p>
<p>
This option may be specified more than once; if so, Git will report
commits reachable from any of the given commits.</p>
<p>
The argument to this option may be a glob on ref names, a ref, or the
(possibly abbreviated) SHA-1 of a commit. Specifying a glob is
equivalent to specifying this option multiple times, one for each
matching ref name.</p>
<p>
See also the <strong>fetch.negotiationAlgorithm</strong> and <strong>push.negotiate</strong>
configuration variables documented in <strong>git-config*(1), and the
*–negotiate-only</strong> option below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–negotiate-only</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not fetch anything from the server, and instead print the ancestors
of the provided <strong>–negotiation-tip=*</strong> arguments, which we have in common
with the server.</p>
<p>
This is incompatible with <strong>–recurse-submodules=[yes|on-demand]</strong>.
Internally this is used to implement the <strong>push.negotiate</strong> option, see
*git-config*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–dry-run</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show what would be done, without making any changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–porcelain</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print the output to standard output in an easy-to-parse format for
scripts. See section OUTPUT in *git-fetch*(1) for details.</p>
<p>
This is incompatible with <strong>–recurse-submodules=[yes|on-demand]</strong> and
takes precedence over the <strong>fetch.output</strong> config option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]write-fetch-head</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write the list of remote refs fetched in the <strong>FETCH_HEAD</strong> file directly
under <strong>$GIT_DIR</strong>. This is the default. Passing <strong>–no-write-fetch-head</strong>
from the command line tells Git not to write the file. Under <strong>–dry-run</strong>
option, the file is never written.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-f, –force</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <em>git fetch</em> is used with <strong>&lt;src&gt;:&lt;dst&gt;</strong> refspec, it may refuse to
update the local branch as discussed in the <strong>&lt;refspec&gt;</strong> part below. This
option overrides that check.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-k, –keep</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep downloaded pack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–multiple</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow several &lt;repository&gt; and &lt;group&gt; arguments to be specified. No
&lt;refspec&gt;s may be specified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]auto-maintenance, –[no-]auto-gc</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run <strong>git maintenance run –auto</strong> at the end to perform automatic
repository maintenance if needed. (<strong>–[no-]auto-gc</strong> is a synonym.) This
is enabled by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]write-commit-graph</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a commit-graph after fetching. This overrides the config setting
<strong>fetch.writeCommitGraph</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–prefetch</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modify the configured refspec to place all refs into the
<strong>refs/prefetch/</strong> namespace. See the <strong>prefetch</strong> task in
*git-maintenance*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-p, –prune</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before fetching, remove any remote-tracking references that no longer
exist on the remote. Tags are not subject to pruning if they are fetched
only because of the default tag auto-following or due to a –tags
option. However, if tags are fetched due to an explicit refspec (either
on the command line or in the remote configuration, for example if the
remote was cloned with the –mirror option), then they are also subject
to pruning. Supplying <strong>–prune-tags</strong> is a shorthand for providing the
tag refspec.</p>
<p>
See the PRUNING section below for more details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-P, –prune-tags</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before fetching, remove any local tags that no longer exist on the
remote if <strong>–prune</strong> is enabled. This option should be used more
carefully, unlike <strong>–prune</strong> it will remove any local references (local
tags) that have been created. This option is a shorthand for providing
the explicit tag refspec along with <strong>–prune</strong>, see the discussion about
that in its documentation.</p>
<p>
See the PRUNING section below for more details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-n, –no-tags</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, tags that point at objects that are downloaded from the
remote repository are fetched and stored locally. This option disables
this automatic tag following. The default behavior for a remote may be
specified with the remote.&lt;name&gt;.tagOpt setting. See *git-config*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–refetch</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of negotiating with the server to avoid transferring commits and
associated objects that are already present locally, this option fetches
all objects as a fresh clone would. Use this to reapply a partial clone
filter from configuration or using <strong>–filter=</strong> when the filter
definition has changed. Automatic post-fetch maintenance will perform
object database pack consolidation to remove any duplicate objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–refmap=&lt;refspec&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When fetching refs listed on the command line, use the specified refspec
(can be given more than once) to map the refs to remote-tracking
branches, instead of the values of <strong>remote.</strong>.fetch* configuration
variables for the remote repository. Providing an empty <strong>&lt;refspec&gt;</strong> to
the <strong>–refmap</strong> option causes Git to ignore the configured refspecs and
rely entirely on the refspecs supplied as command-line arguments. See
section on &#34;Configured Remote-tracking Branches&#34; for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-t, –tags</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fetch all tags from the remote (i.e., fetch remote tags <strong>refs/tags/*</strong>
into local tags with the same name), in addition to whatever else would
otherwise be fetched. Using this option alone does not subject tags to
pruning, even if –prune is used (though tags may be pruned anyway if
they are also the destination of an explicit refspec; see <strong>–prune</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–recurse-submodules[=(yes|on-demand|no)]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option controls if and under what conditions new commits of
submodules should be fetched too. When recursing through submodules,
<strong>git fetch</strong> always attempts to fetch &#34;changed&#34; submodules, that is, a
submodule that has commits that are referenced by a newly fetched
superproject commit but are missing in the local submodule clone. A
changed submodule can be fetched as long as it is present locally e.g.
in <strong>$GIT_DIR/modules/</strong> (see *gitsubmodules*(7)); if the upstream adds a
new submodule, that submodule cannot be fetched until it is cloned e.g.
by <strong>git submodule update</strong>.</p>
<p>
When set to <em>on-demand</em>, only changed submodules are fetched. When set
to <em>yes</em>, all populated submodules are fetched and submodules that are
both unpopulated and changed are fetched. When set to <em>no</em>, submodules
are never fetched.</p>
<p>
When unspecified, this uses the value of <strong>fetch.recurseSubmodules</strong> if it
is set (see *git-config*(1)), defaulting to <em>on-demand</em> if unset. When
this option is used without any value, it defaults to <em>yes</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-j, –jobs=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Number of parallel children to be used for all forms of fetching.</p>
<p>
If the <strong>–multiple</strong> option was specified, the different remotes will be
fetched in parallel. If multiple submodules are fetched, they will be
fetched in parallel. To control them independently, use the config
settings <strong>fetch.parallel</strong> and <strong>submodule.fetchJobs</strong> (see
*git-config*(1)).</p>
<p>
Typically, parallel recursive and multi-remote fetches will be faster.
By default fetches are performed sequentially, not in parallel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-recurse-submodules</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disable recursive fetching of submodules (this has the same effect as
using the <strong>–recurse-submodules=no</strong> option).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–set-upstream</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the remote is fetched successfully, add upstream (tracking)
reference, used by argument-less <strong>git-pull*(1) and other commands. For
more information, see *branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</strong> and <strong>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</strong>
in *git-config*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–submodule-prefix=&lt;path&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prepend &lt;path&gt; to paths printed in informative messages such as
&#34;Fetching submodule foo&#34;. This option is used internally when recursing
over submodules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–recurse-submodules-default=[yes|on-demand]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is used internally to temporarily provide a non-negative
default value for the –recurse-submodules option. All other methods of
configuring fetch&#39;s submodule recursion (such as settings in
*gitmodules*(5) and *git-config*(1)) override this option, as does
specifying –[no-]recurse-submodules directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-u, –update-head-ok</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default <em>git fetch</em> refuses to update the head which corresponds to
the current branch. This flag disables the check. This is purely for the
internal use for <em>git pull</em> to communicate with <em>git fetch</em>, and unless
you are implementing your own Porcelain you are not supposed to use it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–upload-pack &lt;upload-pack&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When given, and the repository to fetch from is handled by <em>git
fetch-pack</em>, <strong>–exec=&lt;upload-pack&gt;</strong> is passed to the command to specify
non-default path for the command run on the other end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-q, –quiet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pass –quiet to git-fetch-pack and silence any other internally used git
commands. Progress is not reported to the standard error stream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-v, –verbose</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be verbose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–progress</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default when
it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is specified. This flag forces
progress status even if the standard error stream is not directed to a
terminal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-o &lt;option&gt;, –server-option=&lt;option&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Transmit the given string to the server when communicating using
protocol version 2. The given string must not contain a NUL or LF
character. The server&#39;s handling of server options, including unknown
ones, is server-specific. When multiple <strong>–server-option=&lt;option&gt;</strong> are
given, they are all sent to the other side in the order listed on the
command line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–show-forced-updates</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, git checks if a branch is force-updated during fetch. This
can be disabled through fetch.showForcedUpdates, but the
–show-forced-updates option guarantees this check occurs. See
*git-config*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-show-forced-updates</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, git checks if a branch is force-updated during fetch. Pass
–no-show-forced-updates or set fetch.showForcedUpdates to false to skip
this check for performance reasons. If used during <em>git-pull</em> the
–ff-only option will still check for forced updates before attempting a
fast-forward update. See *git-config*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-4, –ipv4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use IPv4 addresses only, ignoring IPv6 addresses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-6, –ipv6</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use IPv6 addresses only, ignoring IPv4 addresses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;repository&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The &#34;remote&#34; repository that is the source of a fetch or pull operation.
This parameter can be either a URL (see the section GIT URLS below) or
the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES below).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;group&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A name referring to a list of repositories as the value of
remotes.&lt;group&gt; in the configuration file. (See *git-config*(1)).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;refspec&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies which refs to fetch and which local refs to update. When no
&lt;refspec&gt;s appear on the command line, the refs to fetch are read from
<strong>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.fetch</strong> variables instead (see CONFIGURED
REMOTE-TRACKING BRANCHES below).</p>
<p>
The format of a &lt;refspec&gt; parameter is an optional plus <strong>+</strong>, followed by
the source &lt;src&gt;, followed by a colon <strong>:</strong>, followed by the destination
ref &lt;dst&gt;. The colon can be omitted when &lt;dst&gt; is empty. &lt;src&gt; is
typically a ref, but it can also be a fully spelled hex object name.</p>
<p>
A &lt;refspec&gt; may contain a <strong>*</strong> in its &lt;src&gt; to indicate a simple pattern
match. Such a refspec functions like a glob that matches any ref with
the same prefix. A pattern &lt;refspec&gt; must have a <strong>*</strong> in both the &lt;src&gt;
and &lt;dst&gt;. It will map refs to the destination by replacing the <strong>*</strong> with
the contents matched from the source.</p>
<p>
If a refspec is prefixed by <strong>^</strong>, it will be interpreted as a negative
refspec. Rather than specifying which refs to fetch or which local refs
to update, such a refspec will instead specify refs to exclude. A ref
will be considered to match if it matches at least one positive refspec,
and does not match any negative refspec. Negative refspecs can be useful
to restrict the scope of a pattern refspec so that it will not include
specific refs. Negative refspecs can themselves be pattern refspecs.
However, they may only contain a &lt;src&gt; and do not specify a &lt;dst&gt;. Fully
spelled out hex object names are also not supported.</p>
<p>
<strong>tag &lt;tag&gt;</strong> means the same as <strong>refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;:refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;</strong>; it
requests fetching everything up to the given tag.</p>
<p>
The remote ref that matches &lt;src&gt; is fetched, and if &lt;dst&gt; is not an
empty string, an attempt is made to update the local ref that matches
it.</p>
<p>
Whether that update is allowed without <strong>–force</strong> depends on the ref
namespace it&#39;s being fetched to, the type of object being fetched, and
whether the update is considered to be a fast-forward. Generally, the
same rules apply for fetching as when pushing, see the <strong>&lt;refspec&gt;…</strong>
section of *git-push*(1) for what those are. Exceptions to those rules
particular to <em>git fetch</em> are noted below.</p>
<p>
Until Git version 2.20, and unlike when pushing with <strong>git-push*(1), any
updates to <strong>refs/tags/</strong></strong> would be accepted without <strong>+</strong> in the refspec
(or <strong>–force</strong>). When fetching, we promiscuously considered all tag
updates from a remote to be forced fetches. Since Git version 2.20,
fetching to update <strong>refs/tags/*</strong> works the same way as when pushing.
I.e. any updates will be rejected without <strong>+</strong> in the refspec (or
<strong>–force</strong>).</p>
<p>
Unlike when pushing with <strong>git-push*(1), any updates outside of
<strong>refs/{tags,heads}/</strong></strong> will be accepted without <strong>+</strong> in the refspec (or
<strong>–force</strong>), whether that&#39;s swapping e.g. a tree object for a blob, or a
commit for another commit that doesn&#39;t have the previous commit as an
ancestor etc.</p>
<p>
Unlike when pushing with <strong>git-push*(1), there is no configuration
which&#39;ll amend these rules, and nothing like a *pre-fetch</strong> hook
analogous to the <strong>pre-receive</strong> hook.</p>
<p>
As with pushing with *git-push*(1), all of the rules described above
about what&#39;s not allowed as an update can be overridden by adding an
optional leading <strong>+</strong> to a refspec (or using the <strong>–force</strong> command line
option). The only exception to this is that no amount of forcing will
make the <strong>refs/heads/*</strong> namespace accept a non-commit object.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\\</p>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>
\\
When the remote branch you want to fetch is known to be rewound and
rebased regularly, it is expected that its new tip will not be a
descendant of its previous tip (as stored in your remote-tracking branch
the last time you fetched). You would want to use the <strong>+</strong> sign to
indicate non-fast-forward updates will be needed for such branches.
There is no way to determine or declare that a branch will be made
available in a repository with this behavior; the pulling user simply
must know this is the expected usage pattern for a branch.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
–stdin</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read refspecs, one per line, from stdin in addition to those provided as
arguments. The &#34;tag &lt;name&gt;&#34; format is not supported.</p>

GIT URLS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the
address of the remote server, and the path to the repository. Depending
on the transport protocol, some of this information may be absent.</p>
<p>
Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp and
ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and deprecated;
do not use them).</p>
<p>
The native transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and should
be used with caution on unsecured networks.</p>
<p>
The following syntaxes may be used with them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>ssh://</strong>[/&lt;user&gt;/*@*]/&lt;host&gt;/[*:*/&lt;port&gt;/]*/*/&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;/</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
*git://*/&lt;host&gt;/[:/&lt;port&gt;/]*/*/&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;/</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>http</strong>[*s*]*://*/&lt;host&gt;/[*:*/&lt;port&gt;/]*/*/&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;/</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>ftp</strong>[*s*]*://*/&lt;host&gt;/[*:*/&lt;port&gt;/]*/*/&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
[/&lt;user&gt;/*@*]/&lt;host&gt;/*:/*/&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the first
colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a colon. For
example the local path <strong>foo:bar</strong> could be specified as an absolute path
or <strong>./foo:bar</strong> to avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh url.</p>
<p>
The ssh and git protocols additionally support *~*/&lt;username&gt;/
expansion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>ssh://</strong>[/&lt;user&gt;/*@*]/&lt;host&gt;/[*:*/&lt;port&gt;/]*/~*/&lt;user&gt;/*/*/&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;/</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>git://*/&lt;host&gt;/[</strong>:*/&lt;port&gt;/]*/~*/&lt;user&gt;/*/*/&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;/</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
[/&lt;user&gt;/*@*]/&lt;host&gt;/*:~*/&lt;user&gt;/*/*/&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the following
syntaxes may be used:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong><em>path/to/repo.git</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="///path/to/repo.git/">///path/to/repo.git/</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning, when the
former implies <strong>–local</strong> option. See *git-clone*(1) for details.</p>
<p>
<strong>git clone</strong>, <strong>git fetch</strong> and <strong>git pull</strong>, but not <strong>git push</strong>, will also
accept a suitable bundle file. See *git-bundle*(1).</p>
<p>
When Git doesn&#39;t know how to handle a certain transport protocol, it
attempts to use the *remote-*/&lt;transport&gt;/ remote helper, if one exists.
To explicitly request a remote helper, the following syntax may be used:</p>
<blockquote>

URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being invoked.
See *gitremote-helpers*(7) for details.</p>
<p>
If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories and
you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you use
will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a configuration
section of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        [url &#34;&lt;actual-url-base&gt;&#34;]
                insteadOf = &lt;other-url-base&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
For example, with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        [url &#34;git://git.host.xz/&#34;]
                insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
                insteadOf = work:
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
a URL like &#34;work:repo.git&#34; or like &#34;host.xz:/path/to/repo.git&#34; will be
rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be
&#34;git://git.host.xz/repo.git&#34;.</p>
<p>
If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a
configuration section of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        [url &#34;&lt;actual-url-base&gt;&#34;]
                pushInsteadOf = &lt;other-url-base&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
For example, with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        [url &#34;ssh://example.org/&#34;]
                pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
a URL like &#34;git://example.org/path/to/repo.git&#34; will be rewritten to
&#34;ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git&#34; for pushes, but pulls will still
use the original URL.</p>

CONFIGURED REMOTE-TRACKING BRANCHES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-2">
<p>You often interact with the same remote repository by regularly and
repeatedly fetching from it. In order to keep track of the progress of
such a remote repository, <strong>git fetch</strong> allows you to configure
<strong>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.fetch</strong> configuration variables.</p>
<p>
Typically such a variable may look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
[remote &#34;origin&#34;]
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This configuration is used in two ways:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
When <strong>git fetch</strong> is run without specifying what branches and/or tags to
fetch on the command line, e.g. <strong>git fetch origin</strong> or <strong>git fetch</strong>,
<strong>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.fetch</strong> values are used as the refspecs—they
specify which refs to fetch and which local refs to update. The example
above will fetch all branches that exist in the <strong>origin</strong> (i.e. any ref
that matches the left-hand side of the value, <strong>refs/heads/*</strong>) and update
the corresponding remote-tracking branches in the
<strong>refs/remotes/origin/*</strong> hierarchy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
When <strong>git fetch</strong> is run with explicit branches and/or tags to fetch on
the command line, e.g. <strong>git fetch origin master</strong>, the &lt;refspec&gt;s given
on the command line determine what are to be fetched (e.g. <strong>master</strong> in
the example, which is a short-hand for <strong>master:</strong>, which in turn means
&#34;fetch the <em>master</em> branch but I do not explicitly say what
remote-tracking branch to update with it from the command line&#34;), and
the example command will fetch <em>only</em> the <em>master</em> branch. The
<strong>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.fetch</strong> values determine which remote-tracking
branch, if any, is updated. When used in this way, the
<strong>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.fetch</strong> values do not have any effect in deciding
<em>what</em> gets fetched (i.e. the values are not used as refspecs when the
command-line lists refspecs); they are only used to decide <em>where</em> the
refs that are fetched are stored by acting as a mapping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The latter use of the <strong>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.fetch</strong> values can be
overridden by giving the <strong>–refmap=&lt;refspec&gt;</strong> parameter(s) on the
command line.</p>

PRUNING
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Git has a default disposition of keeping data unless it&#39;s explicitly
thrown away; this extends to holding onto local references to branches
on remotes that have themselves deleted those branches.</p>
<p>
If left to accumulate, these stale references might make performance
worse on big and busy repos that have a lot of branch churn, and e.g.
make the output of commands like <strong>git branch -a –contains &lt;commit&gt;</strong>
needlessly verbose, as well as impacting anything else that&#39;ll work with
the complete set of known references.</p>
<p>
These remote-tracking references can be deleted as a one-off with either
of:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# While fetching
$ git fetch --prune &lt;name&gt;

# Only prune, dont fetch
$ git remote prune &lt;name&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
To prune references as part of your normal workflow without needing to
remember to run that, set <strong>fetch.prune</strong> globally, or
<strong>remote.&lt;name&gt;.prune</strong> per-remote in the config. See *git-config*(1).</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s where things get tricky and more specific. The pruning feature
doesn&#39;t actually care about branches, instead it&#39;ll prune local ←→
remote-references as a function of the refspec of the remote (see
<strong>&lt;refspec&gt;</strong> and CONFIGURED REMOTE-TRACKING BRANCHES above).</p>
<p>
Therefore if the refspec for the remote includes e.g.
<strong>refs/tags/</strong>:refs/tags/**, or you manually run e.g. <strong>git fetch –prune
&lt;name&gt; &#34;refs/tags/</strong>:refs/tags/*&#34;* it won&#39;t be stale remote tracking
branches that are deleted, but any local tag that doesn&#39;t exist on the
remote.</p>
<p>
This might not be what you expect, i.e. you want to prune remote
<strong>&lt;name&gt;</strong>, but also explicitly fetch tags from it, so when you fetch from
it you delete all your local tags, most of which may not have come from
the <strong>&lt;name&gt;</strong> remote in the first place.</p>
<p>
So be careful when using this with a refspec like
<strong>refs/tags/</strong>:refs/tags/**, or any other refspec which might map
references from multiple remotes to the same local namespace.</p>
<p>
Since keeping up-to-date with both branches and tags on the remote is a
common use-case the <strong>–prune-tags</strong> option can be supplied along with
<strong>–prune</strong> to prune local tags that don&#39;t exist on the remote, and
force-update those tags that differ. Tag pruning can also be enabled
with <strong>fetch.pruneTags</strong> or <strong>remote.&lt;name&gt;.pruneTags</strong> in the config. See
*git-config*(1).</p>
<p>
The <strong>–prune-tags</strong> option is equivalent to having
<strong>refs/tags/</strong>:refs/tags/** declared in the refspecs of the remote. This
can lead to some seemingly strange interactions:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# These both fetch tags
$ git fetch --no-tags origin refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*
$ git fetch --no-tags --prune-tags origin
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The reason it doesn&#39;t error out when provided without <strong>–prune</strong> or its
config versions is for flexibility of the configured versions, and to
maintain a 1=1 mapping between what the command line flags do, and what
the configuration versions do.</p>
<p>
It&#39;s reasonable to e.g. configure <strong>fetch.pruneTags=true</strong> in
<strong>~/.gitconfig</strong> to have tags pruned whenever <strong>git fetch –prune</strong> is run,
without making every invocation of <strong>git fetch</strong> without <strong>–prune</strong> an
error.</p>
<p>
Pruning tags with <strong>–prune-tags</strong> also works when fetching a URL instead
of a named remote. These will all prune tags not found on origin:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git fetch origin --prune --prune-tags
$ git fetch origin --prune refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*
$ git fetch &lt;url-of-origin&gt; --prune --prune-tags
$ git fetch &lt;url-of-origin&gt; --prune refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*

OUTPUT

<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The output of &#34;git fetch&#34; depends on the transport method used; this
section describes the output when fetching over the Git protocol (either
locally or via ssh) and Smart HTTP protocol.</p>
<p>
The status of the fetch is output in tabular form, with each line
representing the status of a single ref. Each line is of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
 &lt;flag&gt; &lt;summary&gt; &lt;from&gt; -&gt; &lt;to&gt; [&lt;reason&gt;]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
When using <strong>–porcelain</strong>, the output format is intended to be
machine-parseable. In contrast to the human-readable output formats it
thus prints to standard output instead of standard error. Each line is
of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
&lt;flag&gt; &lt;old-object-id&gt; &lt;new-object-id&gt; &lt;local-reference&gt;

In compact output mode, specified with configuration variable
fetch.output, if either entire <strong>&lt;from&gt;</strong> or <strong>&lt;to&gt;</strong> is found in the other

This updates (or creates, as necessary) branches <strong>seen</strong> and <strong>tmp</strong> in the
local repository by fetching from the branches (respectively) <strong>seen</strong> and
<strong>maint</strong> from the remote repository.</p>
<p>
The <strong>seen</strong> branch will be updated even if it does not fast-forward,

The first command fetches the <strong>maint</strong> branch from the repository at

SECURITY
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side from
stealing data from the other repository that was not intended to be
shared. If you have private data that you need to protect from a
malicious peer, your best option is to store it in another repository.
This applies to both clients and servers. In particular, namespaces on a
server are not effective for read access control; you should only grant
read access to a namespace to clients that you would trust with read
access to the entire repository.</p>
<p>
The known attack vectors are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The victim sends &#34;have&#34; lines advertising the IDs of objects it has that
are not explicitly intended to be shared but can be used to optimize the
transfer if the peer also has them. The attacker chooses an object ID X
to steal and sends a ref to X, but isn&#39;t required to send the content of
X because the victim already has it. Now the victim believes that the
attacker has X, and it sends the content of X back to the attacker
later. (This attack is most straightforward for a client to perform on a
server, by creating a ref to X in the namespace the client has access to
and then fetching it. The most likely way for a server to perform it on
a client is to &#34;merge&#34; X into a public branch and hope that the user
does additional work on this branch and pushes it back to the server
without noticing the merge.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>As in #1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to steal. The victim sends
an object Y that the attacker already has, and the attacker falsely
claims to have X and not Y, so the victim sends Y as a delta against X.
The delta reveals regions of X that are similar to Y to the attacker.</p>

fetch.bundleCreationToken</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When using <strong>fetch.bundleURI</strong> to fetch incrementally from a bundle list
that uses the &#34;creationToken&#34; heuristic, this config value stores the
maximum <strong>creationToken</strong> value of the downloaded bundles. This value is
used to prevent downloading bundles in the future if the advertised
<strong>creationToken</strong> is not strictly larger than this value.</p>
<p>
The creation token values are chosen by the provider serving the
specific bundle URI. If you modify the URI at <strong>fetch.bundleURI</strong>, then be
sure to remove the value for the <strong>fetch.bundleCreationToken</strong> value
before fetching.</p>

<p>Using –recurse-submodules can only fetch new commits in submodules that
are present locally e.g. in <strong>$GIT_DIR/modules/</strong>. If the upstream adds a
new submodule, that submodule cannot be fetched until it is cloned e.g.
by <strong>git submodule update</strong>. This is expected to be fixed in a future Git
version.</p>
