DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the
given log message describing the changes. The new commit is a direct
child of HEAD, usually the tip of the current branch, and the branch is
updated to point to it (unless no branch is associated with the working
tree, in which case HEAD is &#34;detached&#34; as described in
*git-checkout*(1)).</p>
<p>
The content to be committed can be specified in several ways:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>by using *git-add*(1) to incrementally &#34;add&#34; changes to the index before
using the <em>commit</em> command (Note: even modified files must be &#34;added&#34;);</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>by using *git-rm*(1) to remove files from the working tree and the
index, again before using the <em>commit</em> command;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>by listing files as arguments to the <em>commit</em> command (without
–interactive or –patch switch), in which case the commit will ignore
changes staged in the index, and instead record the current content of
the listed files (which must already be known to Git);</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>by using the -a switch with the <em>commit</em> command to automatically &#34;add&#34;
changes from all known files (i.e. all files that are already listed in
the index) and to automatically &#34;rm&#34; files in the index that have been
removed from the working tree, and then perform the actual commit;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>by using the –interactive or –patch switches with the <em>commit</em> command
to decide one by one which files or hunks should be part of the commit
in addition to contents in the index, before finalizing the operation.
See the “Interactive Mode” section of *git-add*(1) to learn how to
operate these modes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <strong>–dry-run</strong> option can be used to obtain a summary of what is
included by any of the above for the next commit by giving the same set
of parameters (options and paths).</p>
<p>
If you make a commit and then find a mistake immediately after that, you
can recover from it with <em>git reset</em>.</p>

<p>-a, –all</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell the command to automatically stage files that have been modified
and deleted, but new files you have not told Git about are not affected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-p, –patch</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the interactive patch selection interface to choose which changes to
commit. See *git-add*(1) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-C &lt;commit&gt;, –reuse-message=&lt;commit&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take an existing commit object, and reuse the log message and the
authorship information (including the timestamp) when creating the
commit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-c &lt;commit&gt;, –reedit-message=&lt;commit&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like <em>-C</em>, but with <strong>-c</strong> the editor is invoked, so that the user can
further edit the commit message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–fixup=[(amend|reword):]&lt;commit&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a new commit which &#34;fixes up&#34; <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong> when applied with <strong>git
rebase –autosquash</strong>. Plain <strong>–fixup=&lt;commit&gt;</strong> creates a &#34;fixup!&#34; commit
which changes the content of <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong> but leaves its log message
untouched. <strong>–fixup=amend:&lt;commit&gt;</strong> is similar but creates an &#34;amend!&#34;
commit which also replaces the log message of <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong> with the log
message of the &#34;amend!&#34; commit. <strong>–fixup=reword:&lt;commit&gt;</strong> creates an
&#34;amend!&#34; commit which replaces the log message of <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong> with its
own log message but makes no changes to the content of <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>
The commit created by plain <strong>–fixup=&lt;commit&gt;</strong> has a subject composed of
&#34;fixup!&#34; followed by the subject line from &lt;commit&gt;, and is recognized
specially by <strong>git rebase –autosquash</strong>. The <strong>-m</strong> option may be used to
supplement the log message of the created commit, but the additional
commentary will be thrown away once the &#34;fixup!&#34; commit is squashed into
<strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong> by <strong>git rebase –autosquash</strong>.</p>
<p>
The commit created by <strong>–fixup=amend:&lt;commit&gt;</strong> is similar but its
subject is instead prefixed with &#34;amend!&#34;. The log message of &lt;commit&gt;
is copied into the log message of the &#34;amend!&#34; commit and opened in an
editor so it can be refined. When <strong>git rebase –autosquash</strong> squashes the
&#34;amend!&#34; commit into <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong>, the log message of <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong> is
replaced by the refined log message from the &#34;amend!&#34; commit. It is an
error for the &#34;amend!&#34; commit&#39;s log message to be empty unless
<strong>–allow-empty-message</strong> is specified.</p>
<p>
<strong>–fixup=reword:&lt;commit&gt;</strong> is shorthand for <strong>–fixup=amend:&lt;commit&gt;
–only</strong>. It creates an &#34;amend!&#34; commit with only a log message (ignoring
any changes staged in the index). When squashed by <strong>git rebase
–autosquash</strong>, it replaces the log message of <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong> without making
any other changes.</p>
<p>
Neither &#34;fixup!&#34; nor &#34;amend!&#34; commits change authorship of <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong>
when applied by <strong>git rebase –autosquash</strong>. See *git-rebase*(1) for
details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–squash=&lt;commit&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct a commit message for use with <strong>rebase –autosquash</strong>. The
commit message subject line is taken from the specified commit with a
prefix of &#34;squash! &#34;. Can be used with additional commit message options
(<strong>-m*/</strong>-c*/*-C*/*-F*). See *git-rebase*(1) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–reset-author</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When used with -C/-c/–amend options, or when committing after a
conflicting cherry-pick, declare that the authorship of the resulting
commit now belongs to the committer. This also renews the author
timestamp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–short</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When doing a dry-run, give the output in the short-format. See
<strong>git-status*(1) for details. Implies *–dry-run</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–branch</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the branch and tracking info even in short-format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–porcelain</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When doing a dry-run, give the output in a porcelain-ready format. See
<strong>git-status*(1) for details. Implies *–dry-run</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–long</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When doing a dry-run, give the output in the long-format. Implies
<strong>–dry-run</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-z, –null</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When showing <strong>short</strong> or <strong>porcelain</strong> status output, print the filename
verbatim and terminate the entries with NUL, instead of LF. If no format
is given, implies the <strong>–porcelain</strong> output format. Without the <strong>-z</strong>
option, filenames with &#34;unusual&#34; characters are quoted as explained for
the configuration variable <strong>core.quotePath</strong> (see *git-config*(1)).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-F &lt;file&gt;, –file=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take the commit message from the given file. Use <em>-</em> to read the message
from the standard input.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–author=&lt;author&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Override the commit author. Specify an explicit author using the
standard <strong>A U Thor &lt;author@example.com&gt;</strong> format. Otherwise &lt;author&gt; is
assumed to be a pattern and is used to search for an existing commit by
that author (i.e. rev-list –all -i –author=&lt;author&gt;); the commit
author is then copied from the first such commit found.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–date=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Override the author date used in the commit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-m &lt;msg&gt;, –message=&lt;msg&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the given &lt;msg&gt; as the commit message. If multiple <strong>-m</strong> options are
given, their values are concatenated as separate paragraphs.</p>
<p>
The <strong>-m</strong> option is mutually exclusive with <strong>-c</strong>, <strong>-C</strong>, and <strong>-F</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-t &lt;file&gt;, –template=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When editing the commit message, start the editor with the contents in
the given file. The <strong>commit.template</strong> configuration variable is often
used to give this option implicitly to the command. This mechanism can
be used by projects that want to guide participants with some hints on
what to write in the message in what order. If the user exits the editor
without editing the message, the commit is aborted. This has no effect
when a message is given by other means, e.g. with the <strong>-m</strong> or <strong>-F</strong>
options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-s, –signoff, –no-signoff</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add a <strong>Signed-off-by</strong> trailer by the committer at the end of the commit
log message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the project to which
you&#39;re committing. For example, it may certify that the committer has
the rights to submit the work under the project&#39;s license or agrees to
some contributor representation, such as a Developer Certificate of
Origin. (See <strong><a href="https://developercertificate.org">https://developercertificate.org</a></strong> for the one used by the
Linux kernel and Git projects.) Consult the documentation or leadership
of the project to which you&#39;re contributing to understand how the
signoffs are used in that project.</p>
<p>
The –no-signoff option can be used to countermand an earlier –signoff
option on the command line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–trailer &lt;token&gt;[(=|:)&lt;value&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify a (&lt;token&gt;, &lt;value&gt;) pair that should be applied as a trailer.
(e.g. *git commit –trailer &#34;Signed-off-by:C O Mitter \
&lt;committer@example.com&gt;&#34; –trailer &#34;Helped-by:C O Mitter \
&lt;committer@example.com&gt;&#34;* will add the &#34;Signed-off-by&#34; trailer and the
&#34;Helped-by&#34; trailer to the commit message.) The <strong>trailer.*</strong>
configuration variables (*git-interpret-trailers*(1)) can be used to
define if a duplicated trailer is omitted, where in the run of trailers
each trailer would appear, and other details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-n, –[no-]verify</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, the pre-commit and commit-msg hooks are run. When any of
<strong>–no-verify</strong> or <strong>-n</strong> is given, these are bypassed. See also
*githooks*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–allow-empty</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Usually recording a commit that has the exact same tree as its sole
parent commit is a mistake, and the command prevents you from making
such a commit. This option bypasses the safety, and is primarily for use
by foreign SCM interface scripts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–allow-empty-message</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like –allow-empty this command is primarily for use by foreign SCM
interface scripts. It allows you to create a commit with an empty commit
message without using plumbing commands like *git-commit-tree*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–cleanup=&lt;mode&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option determines how the supplied commit message should be cleaned
up before committing. The <em>&lt;mode&gt;</em> can be <strong>strip</strong>, <strong>whitespace</strong>,
<strong>verbatim</strong>, <strong>scissors</strong> or <strong>default</strong>.</p>
<p>
strip</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strip leading and trailing empty lines, trailing whitespace, commentary
and collapse consecutive empty lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
whitespace</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Same as <strong>strip</strong> except #commentary is not removed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
verbatim</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not change the message at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
scissors</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Same as <strong>whitespace</strong> except that everything from (and including) the
line found below is truncated, if the message is to be edited. &#34;<strong>#</strong>&#34; can
be customized with core.commentChar.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# ------------------------ &gt;8 ------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
default</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Same as <strong>strip</strong> if the message is to be edited. Otherwise <strong>whitespace</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The default can be changed by the <strong>commit.cleanup</strong> configuration
variable (see *git-config*(1)).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-e, –edit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The message taken from file with <strong>-F</strong>, command line with <strong>-m</strong>, and from
commit object with <strong>-C</strong> are usually used as the commit log message
unmodified. This option lets you further edit the message taken from
these sources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-edit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the selected commit message without launching an editor. For
example, <strong>git commit –amend –no-edit</strong> amends a commit without changing
its commit message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–amend</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Replace the tip of the current branch by creating a new commit. The
recorded tree is prepared as usual (including the effect of the <strong>-i</strong> and
<strong>-o</strong> options and explicit pathspec), and the message from the original
commit is used as the starting point, instead of an empty message, when
no other message is specified from the command line via options such as
<strong>-m</strong>, <strong>-F</strong>, <strong>-c</strong>, etc. The new commit has the same parents and author as
the current one (the <strong>–reset-author</strong> option can countermand this).</p>
<p>
It is a rough equivalent for:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        $ git reset --soft HEAD^
        $ ... do something else to come up with the right tree ...
        $ git commit -c ORIG_HEAD
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
but can be used to amend a merge commit.</p>
<p>
You should understand the implications of rewriting history if you amend
a commit that has already been published. (See the &#34;RECOVERING FROM
UPSTREAM REBASE&#34; section in *git-rebase*(1).)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-post-rewrite</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bypass the post-rewrite hook.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-i, –include</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before making a commit out of staged contents so far, stage the contents
of paths given on the command line as well. This is usually not what you
want unless you are concluding a conflicted merge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-o, –only</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make a commit by taking the updated working tree contents of the paths
specified on the command line, disregarding any contents that have been
staged for other paths. This is the default mode of operation of <em>git
commit</em> if any paths are given on the command line, in which case this
option can be omitted. If this option is specified together with
<strong>–amend</strong>, then no paths need to be specified, which can be used to
amend the last commit without committing changes that have already been
staged. If used together with <strong>–allow-empty</strong> paths are also not
required, and an empty commit will be created.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pathspec is passed in <strong>&lt;file&gt;</strong> instead of commandline args. If <strong>&lt;file&gt;</strong>
is exactly <strong>-</strong> then standard input is used. Pathspec elements are
separated by LF or CR/LF. Pathspec elements can be quoted as explained
for the configuration variable <strong>core.quotePath</strong> (see <strong>git-config*(1)).
See also *–pathspec-file-nul</strong> and global <strong>–literal-pathspecs</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–pathspec-file-nul</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only meaningful with <strong>–pathspec-from-file</strong>. Pathspec elements are
separated with NUL character and all other characters are taken
literally (including newlines and quotes).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-u[&lt;mode&gt;], –untracked-files[=&lt;mode&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show untracked files.</p>
<p>
The mode parameter is optional (defaults to <em>all</em>), and is used to
specify the handling of untracked files; when -u is not used, the
default is <em>normal</em>, i.e. show untracked files and directories.</p>
<p>
The possible options are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>no</em> - Show no untracked files</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>normal</em> - Shows untracked files and directories</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>all</em> - Also shows individual files in untracked directories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
All usual spellings for Boolean value <strong>true</strong> are taken as <strong>normal</strong> and
<strong>false</strong> as <strong>no</strong>. The default can be changed using the
status.showUntrackedFiles configuration variable documented in
*git-config*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-v, –verbose</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show unified diff between the HEAD commit and what would be committed at
the bottom of the commit message template to help the user describe the
commit by reminding what changes the commit has. Note that this diff
output doesn&#39;t have its lines prefixed with <em>#</em>. This diff will not be a
part of the commit message. See the <strong>commit.verbose</strong> configuration
variable in *git-config*(1).</p>
<p>
If specified twice, show in addition the unified diff between what would
be committed and the worktree files, i.e. the unstaged changes to
tracked files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-q, –quiet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppress commit summary message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–dry-run</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not create a commit, but show a list of paths that are to be
committed, paths with local changes that will be left uncommitted and
paths that are untracked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–status</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Include the output of *git-status*(1) in the commit message template
when using an editor to prepare the commit message. Defaults to on, but
can be used to override configuration variable commit.status.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-status</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not include the output of *git-status*(1) in the commit message
template when using an editor to prepare the default commit message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-S[&lt;keyid&gt;], –gpg-sign[=&lt;keyid&gt;], –no-gpg-sign</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GPG-sign commits. The <strong>keyid</strong> argument is optional and defaults to the
committer identity; if specified, it must be stuck to the option without
a space. <strong>–no-gpg-sign</strong> is useful to countermand both <strong>commit.gpgSign</strong>
configuration variable, and earlier <strong>–gpg-sign</strong>.</p>

&lt;pathspec&gt;…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When pathspec is given on the command line, commit the contents of the
files that match the pathspec without recording the changes already
added to the index. The contents of these files are also staged for the
next commit on top of what have been staged before.</p>

EXAMPLES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When recording your own work, the contents of modified files in your
working tree are temporarily stored to a staging area called the &#34;index&#34;
with <em>git add</em>. A file can be reverted back, only in the index but not
in the working tree, to that of the last commit with <strong>git restore
–staged &lt;file&gt;</strong>, which effectively reverts <em>git add</em> and prevents the
changes to this file from participating in the next commit. After
building the state to be committed incrementally with these commands,
<strong>git commit</strong> (without any pathname parameter) is used to record what has
been staged so far. This is the most basic form of the command. An
example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ edit hello.c
$ git rm goodbye.c
$ git add hello.c
$ git commit
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Instead of staging files after each individual change, you can tell <strong>git
commit</strong> to notice the changes to the files whose contents are tracked in
your working tree and do corresponding <strong>git add</strong> and <strong>git rm</strong> for you.
That is, this example does the same as the earlier example if there is
no other change in your working tree:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ edit hello.c
$ rm goodbye.c
$ git commit -a
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The command <strong>git commit -a</strong> first looks at your working tree, notices
that you have modified hello.c and removed goodbye.c, and performs
necessary <strong>git add</strong> and <strong>git rm</strong> for you.</p>
<p>
After staging changes to many files, you can alter the order the changes
are recorded in, by giving pathnames to <strong>git commit</strong>. When pathnames are
given, the command makes a commit that only records the changes made to
the named paths:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ edit hello.c hello.h
$ git add hello.c hello.h
$ edit Makefile
$ git commit Makefile
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This makes a commit that records the modification to <strong>Makefile</strong>. The
changes staged for <strong>hello.c</strong> and <strong>hello.h</strong> are not included in the
resulting commit. However, their changes are not lost — they are still
staged and merely held back. After the above sequence, if you do:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git commit
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
this second commit would record the changes to <strong>hello.c</strong> and <strong>hello.h</strong>
as expected.</p>
<p>
After a merge (initiated by <em>git merge</em> or <em>git pull</em>) stops because of
conflicts, cleanly merged paths are already staged to be committed for
you, and paths that conflicted are left in unmerged state. You would
have to first check which paths are conflicting with <em>git status</em> and
after fixing them manually in your working tree, you would stage the
result as usual with <em>git add</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git status | grep unmerged
unmerged: hello.c
$ edit hello.c
$ git add hello.c
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
After resolving conflicts and staging the result, <strong>git ls-files -u</strong>
would stop mentioning the conflicted path. When you are done, run <strong>git
commit</strong> to finally record the merge:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git commit
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
As with the case to record your own changes, you can use <strong>-a</strong> option to
save typing. One difference is that during a merge resolution, you
cannot use <strong>git commit</strong> with pathnames to alter the order the changes
are committed, because the merge should be recorded as a single commit.
In fact, the command refuses to run when given pathnames (but see <strong>-i</strong>
option).</p>

<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Author and committer information is taken from the following environment
variables, if set:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL
GIT_AUTHOR_DATE
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
(nb &#34;&lt;&#34;, &#34;&gt;&#34; and &#34;\n&#34;s are stripped)</p>
<p>
The author and committer names are by convention some form of a personal
name (that is, the name by which other humans refer to you), although
Git does not enforce or require any particular form. Arbitrary Unicode
may be used, subject to the constraints listed above. This name has no
effect on authentication; for that, see the <strong>credential.username</strong>
variable in *git-config*(1).</p>
<p>
In case (some of) these environment variables are not set, the
information is taken from the configuration items <strong>user.name</strong> and
<strong>user.email</strong>, or, if not present, the environment variable EMAIL, or, if
that is not set, system user name and the hostname used for outgoing
mail (taken from <strong>/etc/mailname</strong> and falling back to the fully qualified
hostname when that file does not exist).</p>
<p>
The <strong>author.name</strong> and <strong>committer.name</strong> and their corresponding email
options override <strong>user.name</strong> and <strong>user.email</strong> if set and are overridden
themselves by the environment variables.</p>
<p>
The typical usage is to set just the <strong>user.name</strong> and <strong>user.email</strong>
variables; the other options are provided for more complex use cases.</p>

DATE FORMATS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The <strong>GIT_AUTHOR_DATE</strong> and <strong>GIT_COMMITTER_DATE</strong> environment variables
support the following date formats:</p>
<p>
Git internal format</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is <strong>&lt;unix-timestamp&gt; &lt;time-zone-offset&gt;</strong>, where <strong>&lt;unix-timestamp&gt;</strong> is
the number of seconds since the UNIX epoch. <strong>&lt;time-zone-offset&gt;</strong> is a
positive or negative offset from UTC. For example CET (which is 1 hour
ahead of UTC) is <strong>+0100</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
RFC 2822</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The standard date format as described by RFC 2822, for example <strong>Thu, 07
Apr 2005 22:13:13 +0200</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
ISO 8601</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Time and date specified by the ISO 8601 standard, for example
<strong>2005-04-07T22:13:13</strong>. The parser accepts a space instead of the <strong>T</strong>
character as well. Fractional parts of a second will be ignored, for
example <strong>2005-04-07T22:13:13.019</strong> will be treated as
<strong>2005-04-07T22:13:13</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\\</p>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>
\\
In addition, the date part is accepted in the following formats:
<strong>YYYY.MM.DD</strong>, <strong>MM/DD/YYYY</strong> and <strong>DD.MM.YYYY</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
In addition to recognizing all date formats above, the <strong>–date</strong> option
will also try to make sense of other, more human-centric date formats,
such as relative dates like &#34;yesterday&#34; or &#34;last Friday at noon&#34;.</p>

DISCUSSION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Though not required, it&#39;s a good idea to begin the commit message with a
single short (no more than 50 characters) line summarizing the change,
followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description. The text
up to the first blank line in a commit message is treated as the commit
title, and that title is used throughout Git. For example,
*git-format-patch*(1) turns a commit into email, and it uses the title
on the Subject line and the rest of the commit in the body.</p>
<p>
Git is to some extent character encoding agnostic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
The contents of the blob objects are uninterpreted sequences of bytes.
There is no encoding translation at the core level.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Path names are encoded in UTF-8 normalization form C. This applies to
tree objects, the index file, ref names, as well as path names in
command line arguments, environment variables and config files
(<strong>.git/config</strong> (see *git-config*(1)), *gitignore*(5), *gitattributes*(5)
and *gitmodules*(5)).</p>
<p>
Note that Git at the core level treats path names simply as sequences of
non-NUL bytes, there are no path name encoding conversions (except on
Mac and Windows). Therefore, using non-ASCII path names will mostly work
even on platforms and file systems that use legacy extended ASCII
encodings. However, repositories created on such systems will not work
properly on UTF-8-based systems (e.g. Linux, Mac, Windows) and vice
versa. Additionally, many Git-based tools simply assume path names to be
UTF-8 and will fail to display other encodings correctly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Commit log messages are typically encoded in UTF-8, but other extended
ASCII encodings are also supported. This includes ISO-8859-x, CP125x and
many others, but <em>not</em> UTF-16/32, EBCDIC and CJK multi-byte encodings
(GBK, Shift-JIS, Big5, EUC-x, CP9xx etc.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded in UTF-8,
both the core and Git Porcelain are designed not to force UTF-8 on
projects. If all participants of a particular project find it more
convenient to use legacy encodings, Git does not forbid it. However,
there are a few things to keep in mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>git commit</em> and <em>git commit-tree</em> issue a warning if the commit log
message given to it does not look like a valid UTF-8 string, unless you
explicitly say your project uses a legacy encoding. The way to say this
is to have <strong>i18n.commitEncoding</strong> in <strong>.git/config</strong> file, like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
[i18n]
        commitEncoding = ISO-8859-1
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Commit objects created with the above setting record the value of
<strong>i18n.commitEncoding</strong> in their <strong>encoding</strong> header. This is to help other
people who look at them later. Lack of this header implies that the
commit log message is encoded in UTF-8.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>git log</em>, <em>git show</em>, <em>git blame</em> and friends look at the <strong>encoding</strong>
header of a commit object, and try to re-code the log message into UTF-8
unless otherwise specified. You can specify the desired output encoding
with <strong>i18n.logOutputEncoding</strong> in <strong>.git/config</strong> file, like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
[i18n]
        logOutputEncoding = ISO-8859-1
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you do not have this configuration variable, the value of
<strong>i18n.commitEncoding</strong> is used instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that we deliberately chose not to re-code the commit log message
when a commit is made to force UTF-8 at the commit object level, because
re-coding to UTF-8 is not necessarily a reversible operation.</p>

ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The editor used to edit the commit log message will be chosen from the
<strong>GIT_EDITOR</strong> environment variable, the core.editor configuration
variable, the <strong>VISUAL</strong> environment variable, or the <strong>EDITOR</strong> environment
variable (in that order). See *git-var*(1) for details.</p>
<p>
Everything above this line in this section isn&#39;t included from the
*git-config*(1) documentation. The content that follows is the same as
what&#39;s found there:</p>
<p>
commit.cleanup</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This setting overrides the default of the <strong>–cleanup</strong> option in <strong>git
commit</strong>. See *git-commit*(1) for details. Changing the default can be
useful when you always want to keep lines that begin with the comment
character <strong>#</strong> in your log message, in which case you would do <strong>git
config commit.cleanup whitespace</strong> (note that you will have to remove the
help lines that begin with <strong>#</strong> in the commit log template yourself, if
you do this).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
commit.gpgSign</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean to specify whether all commits should be GPG signed. Use of
this option when doing operations such as rebase can result in a large
number of commits being signed. It may be convenient to use an agent to
avoid typing your GPG passphrase several times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
commit.status</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean to enable/disable inclusion of status information in the
commit message template when using an editor to prepare the commit
message. Defaults to true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
commit.template</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the pathname of a file to use as the template for new commit
messages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
commit.verbose</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean or int to specify the level of verbosity with <strong>git commit</strong>.
See *git-commit*(1).</p>
