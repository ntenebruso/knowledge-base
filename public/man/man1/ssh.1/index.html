DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>ssh</strong> (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and
for executing commands on a remote machine. It is intended to provide
secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an
insecure network. X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports and UNIX-domain
sockets can also be forwarded over the secure channel.</p>
<p>
<strong>ssh</strong> connects and logs into the specified <em>destination</em>, which may be
specified as either [user@]hostname or a URI of the form
ssh://[user@]hostname[:port.] The user must prove their identity to the
remote machine using one of several methods (see below).</p>
<p>
If a <em>command</em> is specified, it will be executed on the remote host
instead of a login shell. A complete command line may be specified as
<em>command</em>, or it may have additional arguments. If supplied, the
arguments will be appended to the command, separated by spaces, before
it is sent to the server to be executed.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-4</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Forces <strong>ssh</strong> to use IPv4 addresses only.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-6</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Forces <strong>ssh</strong> to use IPv6 addresses only.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-A</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Enables forwarding of connections from an authentication agent
such as *ssh-agent*(1). This can also be specified on a per-host basis
in a configuration file.

Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the
ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the agent&#39;s
UNIX-domain socket) can access the local agent through the forwarded
connection. An attacker cannot obtain key material from the agent,
however they can perform operations on the keys that enable them to
authenticate using the identities loaded into the agent. A safer
alternative may be to use a jump host (see <strong>-J</strong> ) .</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-a</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Disables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-B</strong> <em>bind_interface</em>
</dt>
<dd>Bind to the address of <em>bind_interface</em>
before attempting to connect to the destination host. This is only
useful on systems with more than one address.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-b</strong> <em>bind_address</em>
</dt>
<dd>Use <em>bind_address</em> on the local machine as the
source address of the connection. Only useful on systems with more
than one address.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-C</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout,
stderr, and data for forwarded X11, TCP and UNIX-domain connections).
The compression algorithm is the same used by *gzip*(1). Compression
is desirable on modem lines and other slow connections, but will only
slow down things on fast networks. The default value can be set on a
host-by-host basis in the configuration files; see the <strong>Compression</strong>
option in *ssh_config*(5).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-c</strong> <em>cipher_spec</em>
</dt>
<dd>Selects the cipher specification for encrypting
the session. <em>cipher_spec</em> is a comma-separated list of ciphers listed
in order of preference. See the <strong>Ciphers</strong> keyword in *ssh_config*(5)
for more information.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-D</strong> [/bind_address/:] <em>port</em> 
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a local ``dynamic&#39;&#39;
application-level port forwarding. This works by allocating a socket
to listen to <em>port</em> on the local side, optionally bound to the
specified <em>bind_address</em>. Whenever a connection is made to this port,
the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and the
application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to
from the remote machine. Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are
supported, and <strong>ssh</strong> will act as a SOCKS server. Only root can forward
privileged ports. Dynamic port forwardings can also be specified in
the configuration file.

IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square
brackets. Only the superuser can forward privileged ports. By default,
the local port is bound in accordance with the <strong>GatewayPorts</strong> setting.
However, an explicit <em>bind_address</em> may be used to bind the connection
to a specific address. The <em>bind_address</em> of ``localhost&#39;&#39; indicates
that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an empty
address or `*&#39; indicates that the port should be available from all
interfaces.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-E</strong> <em>log_file</em>
</dt>
<dd>Append debug logs to <em>log_file</em> instead of standard
error.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-e</strong> <em>escape_char</em>
</dt>
<dd>Sets the escape character for sessions with a
pty (default: `~&#39; ) . The escape character is only recognized at the
beginning of a line. The escape character followed by a dot (`.&#39;)
closes the connection; followed by control-Z suspends the connection;
and followed by itself sends the escape character once. Setting the
character to ``none&#39;&#39; disables any escapes and makes the session fully
transparent.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-F</strong> <em>configfile</em>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies an alternative per-user configuration
file. If a configuration file is given on the command line, the
system-wide configuration file (<em>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</em>) will be
ignored. The default for the per-user configuration file is
<em>~</em>.ssh/config/. If set to ``none&#39;&#39;, no configuration files will be
read.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-f</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Requests <strong>ssh</strong> to go to background just before command
execution. This is useful if <strong>ssh</strong> is going to ask for passwords or
passphrases, but the user wants it in the background. This implies
<strong>-n</strong>. The recommended way to start X11 programs at a remote site is
with something like <strong>ssh -f host xterm</strong>.

If the <strong>ExitOnForwardFailure</strong> configuration option is set to ``yes&#39;&#39;,
then a client started with <strong>-f</strong> will wait for all remote port forwards
to be successfully established before placing itself in the
background. Refer to the description of <strong>ForkAfterAuthentication</strong> in
*ssh_config*(5) for details.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-G</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Causes <strong>ssh</strong> to print its configuration after evaluating
<strong>Host</strong> and <strong>Match</strong> blocks and exit.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-g</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Allows remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports. If
used on a multiplexed connection, then this option must be specified
on the master process.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-I</strong> <em>pkcs11</em>
</dt>
<dd>Specify the PKCS#11 shared library <strong>ssh</strong> should use
to communicate with a PKCS#11 token providing keys for user
authentication.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-i</strong> <em>identity_file</em>
</dt>
<dd>Selects a file from which the identity
(private key) for public key authentication is read. You can also
specify a public key file to use the corresponding private key that is
loaded in *ssh-agent*(1) when the private key file is not present
locally. The default is <em>~</em>.ssh/id_rsa/, <em>~</em>.ssh/id_ecdsa/,
<em>~</em>.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk/, <em>~</em>.ssh/id_ed25519/ and <em>~</em>.ssh/id_ed25519_sk/.
Identity files may also be specified on a per-host basis in the
configuration file. It is possible to have multiple <strong>-i</strong> options (and
multiple identities specified in configuration files). If no
certificates have been explicitly specified by the <strong>CertificateFile</strong>
directive, <strong>ssh</strong> will also try to load certificate information from
the filename obtained by appending <em>-cert.pub</em> to identity filenames.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-J</strong> <em>destination</em>
</dt>
<dd>Connect to the target host by first making an
<strong>ssh</strong> connection to the jump host described by <em>destination</em> and then
establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from there.
Multiple jump hops may be specified separated by comma characters.
IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square
brackets. This is a shortcut to specify a <strong>ProxyJump</strong> configuration
directive. Note that configuration directives supplied on the
command-line generally apply to the destination host and not any
specified jump hosts. Use <em>~</em>.ssh/config/ to specify configuration for
jump hosts.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-K</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Enables GSSAPI-based authentication and forwarding
(delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the server.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-k</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Disables forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the
server.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-L</strong> [/bind_address/:] <em>port</em>:host:hostport 
</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><strong>-L</strong>
 [/bind_address/:] <em>port</em>:remote_socket  :: - <strong>-L</strong>
   <em>local_socket</em>:host:hostport  :: - <strong>-L</strong>
     <em>local_socket</em>:remote_socket  :: Specifies that connections to
     the given TCP port or Unix socket on the local (client) host are
     to be forwarded to the given host and port, or Unix socket, on
     the remote side. This works by allocating a socket to listen to
     either a TCP <em>port</em> on the local side, optionally bound to the
     specified <em>bind_address</em>, or to a Unix socket. Whenever a
     connection is made to the local port or socket, the connection
     is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is made
     to either <em>host</em> port <em>hostport</em>, or the Unix socket
     <em>remote_socket</em>, from the remote machine.

     Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration
     file. Only the superuser can forward privileged ports. IPv6
     addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square
     brackets.

     By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the
     <strong>GatewayPorts</strong> setting. However, an explicit <em>bind_address</em> may
     be used to bind the connection to a specific address. The
     <em>bind_address</em> of ``localhost&#39;&#39; indicates that the listening
     port be bound for local use only, while an empty address or `*&#39;
     indicates that the port should be available from all interfaces.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-l</strong> <em>login_name</em>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the user to log in as on the remote
machine. This also may be specified on a per-host basis in the
configuration file.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-M</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Places the <strong>ssh</strong> client into ``master&#39;&#39; mode for connection
sharing. Multiple <strong>-M</strong> options places <strong>ssh</strong> into ``master&#39;&#39; mode but
with confirmation required using *ssh-askpass*(1) before each
operation that changes the multiplexing state (e.g. opening a new
session). Refer to the description of <strong>ControlMaster</strong> in
*ssh_config*(5) for details.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-m</strong> <em>mac_spec</em>
</dt>
<dd>A comma-separated list of MAC (message
authentication code) algorithms, specified in order of preference. See
the <strong>MACs</strong> keyword in *ssh_config*(5) for more information.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-N</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Do not execute a remote command. This is useful for just
forwarding ports. Refer to the description of <strong>SessionType</strong> in
*ssh_config*(5) for details.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-n</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Redirects stdin from <em>/dev/null</em> (actually, prevents reading
from stdin). This must be used when <strong>ssh</strong> is run in the background. A
common trick is to use this to run X11 programs on a remote machine.
For example, <strong>ssh -n shadows.cs.hut.fi emacs &amp;</strong> will start an emacs on
shadows.cs.hut.fi, and the X11 connection will be automatically
forwarded over an encrypted channel. The <strong>ssh</strong> program will be put in
the background. (This does not work if <strong>ssh</strong> needs to ask for a
password or passphrase; see also the <strong>-f</strong> option.) Refer to the
description of <strong>StdinNull</strong> in *ssh_config*(5) for details.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-O</strong> <em>ctl_cmd</em>
</dt>
<dd>Control an active connection multiplexing master
process. When the <strong>-O</strong> option is specified, the <em>ctl_cmd</em> argument is
interpreted and passed to the master process. Valid commands are:
``check&#39;&#39; (check that the master process is running), ``forward&#39;&#39;
(request forwardings without command execution), ``cancel&#39;&#39; (cancel
forwardings), ``exit&#39;&#39; (request the master to exit), and ``stop&#39;&#39;
(request the master to stop accepting further multiplexing requests).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-o</strong> <em>option</em>
</dt>
<dd>Can be used to give options in the format used in the
configuration file. This is useful for specifying options for which
there is no separate command-line flag. For full details of the
options listed below, and their possible values, see *ssh_config*(5).</dd>

        :: Specifies that connections to the given TCP port or Unix
       socket on the remote (server) host are to be forwarded to the
       local side.

       This works by allocating a socket to listen to either a TCP
       <em>port</em> or to a Unix socket on the remote side. Whenever a
       connection is made to this port or Unix socket, the connection
       is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is made
       from the local machine to either an explicit destination
       specified by <em>host</em> port <em>hostport</em>, or <em>local_socket</em>, or, if
       no explicit destination was specified, <strong>ssh</strong> will act as a
       SOCKS 4/5 proxy and forward connections to the destinations
       requested by the remote SOCKS client.

       Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration
       file. Privileged ports can be forwarded only when logging in
       as root on the remote machine. IPv6 addresses can be specified
       by enclosing the address in square brackets.

       By default, TCP listening sockets on the server will be bound
       to the loopback interface only. This may be overridden by
       specifying a <em>bind_address</em>. An empty <em>bind_address</em>, or the
       address `*&#39;, indicates that the remote socket should listen on
       all interfaces. Specifying a remote <em>bind_address</em> will only
       succeed if the server&#39;s <strong>GatewayPorts</strong> option is enabled (see
       *sshd_config*(5)) .

       If the <em>port</em> argument is `0&#39;, the listen port will be
       dynamically allocated on the server and reported to the client
       at run time. When used together with <strong>-O forward</strong>, the
       allocated port will be printed to the standard output.</li>

<strong>TunnelDevice</strong> directives in *ssh_config*(5).

If the <strong>Tunnel</strong> directive is unset, it will be set to the default

forwarding mode it desired, then it should be specified before <strong>-w</strong>.</dd>

X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the ability

authorization database) can access the local X11 display through the
forwarded connection. An attacker may then be able to perform
activities such as keystroke monitoring.

For this reason, X11 forwarding is subjected to X11 SECURITY extension
restrictions by default. Refer to the <strong>ssh</strong> <strong>-Y</strong> option and the

AUTHENTICATION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The OpenSSH SSH client supports SSH protocol 2.</p>
<p>
The methods available for authentication are: GSSAPI-based
authentication, host-based authentication, public key authentication,
keyboard-interactive authentication, and password authentication.
Authentication methods are tried in the order specified above, though
<strong>PreferredAuthentications</strong> can be used to change the default order.</p>
<p>
Host-based authentication works as follows: If the machine the user logs
in from is listed in <em>/etc/hosts.equiv</em> or <em>/etc/ssh/shosts.equiv</em> on
the remote machine, the user is non-root and the user names are the same
on both sides, or if the files <em>~</em>.rhosts/ or <em>~</em>.shosts/ exist in the
user&#39;s home directory on the remote machine and contain a line
containing the name of the client machine and the name of the user on
that machine, the user is considered for login. Additionally, the server
<em>must</em> be able to verify the client&#39;s host key (see the description of
<em>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</em> and <em>~</em>.ssh/known_hosts/, below) for login to
be permitted. This authentication method closes security holes due to IP
spoofing, DNS spoofing, and routing spoofing. [Note to the
administrator: <em>/etc/hosts.equiv</em>, <em>~</em>.rhosts/, and the rlogin/rsh
protocol in general, are inherently insecure and should be disabled if
security is desired.]</p>
<p>
Public key authentication works as follows: The scheme is based on
public-key cryptography, using cryptosystems where encryption and
decryption are done using separate keys, and it is unfeasible to derive
the decryption key from the encryption key. The idea is that each user
creates a public/private key pair for authentication purposes. The
server knows the public key, and only the user knows the private key.
<strong>ssh</strong> implements public key authentication protocol automatically, using
one of the ECDSA, Ed25519 or RSA algorithms.</p>
<p>
The file <em>~</em>.ssh/authorized_keys/ lists the public keys that are
permitted for logging in. When the user logs in, the <strong>ssh</strong> program tells
the server which key pair it would like to use for authentication. The
client proves that it has access to the private key and the server
checks that the corresponding public key is authorized to accept the
account.</p>
<p>
The server may inform the client of errors that prevented public key
authentication from succeeding after authentication completes using a
different method. These may be viewed by increasing the <strong>LogLevel</strong> to
<strong>DEBUG</strong> or higher (e.g. by using the <strong>-v</strong> flag).</p>
<p>
The user creates their key pair by running *ssh-keygen*(1). This stores
the private key in <em>~</em>.ssh/id_ecdsa/ (ECDSA), <em>~</em>.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk/
(authenticator-hosted ECDSA), <em>~</em>.ssh/id_ed25519/ (Ed25519),
<em>~</em>.ssh/id_ed25519_sk/ (authenticator-hosted Ed25519), or
<em>~</em>.ssh/id_rsa/ (RSA) and stores the public key in <em>~</em>.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub/
(ECDSA), <em>~</em>.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk.pub/ (authenticator-hosted ECDSA),
<em>~</em>.ssh/id_ed25519.pub/ (Ed25519), <em>~</em>.ssh/id_ed25519_sk.pub/
(authenticator-hosted Ed25519), or <em>~</em>.ssh/id_rsa.pub/ (RSA) in the
user&#39;s home directory. The user should then copy the public key to
<em>~</em>.ssh/authorized_keys/ in their home directory on the remote machine.
The <em>authorized_keys</em> file corresponds to the conventional <em>~</em>.rhosts/
file, and has one key per line, though the lines can be very long. After
this, the user can log in without giving the password.</p>
<p>
A variation on public key authentication is available in the form of
certificate authentication: instead of a set of public/private keys,
signed certificates are used. This has the advantage that a single
trusted certification authority can be used in place of many
public/private keys. See the CERTIFICATES section of *ssh-keygen*(1) for
more information.</p>
<p>
The most convenient way to use public key or certificate authentication
may be with an authentication agent. See <strong>ssh-agent*(1) and (optionally)
the *AddKeysToAgent</strong> directive in *ssh_config*(5) for more information.</p>
<p>
Keyboard-interactive authentication works as follows: The server sends
an arbitrary Qq challenge text and prompts for a response, possibly
multiple times. Examples of keyboard-interactive authentication include
Bx Authentication (see *login.conf*(5)) and PAM (some non- OpenBSD
systems).</p>
<p>
Finally, if other authentication methods fail, <strong>ssh</strong> prompts the user
for a password. The password is sent to the remote host for checking;
however, since all communications are encrypted, the password cannot be
seen by someone listening on the network.</p>
<p>
<strong>ssh</strong> automatically maintains and checks a database containing
identification for all hosts it has ever been used with. Host keys are
stored in <em>~</em>.ssh/known_hosts/ in the user&#39;s home directory.
Additionally, the file <em>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</em> is automatically
checked for known hosts. Any new hosts are automatically added to the
user&#39;s file. If a host&#39;s identification ever changes, <strong>ssh</strong> warns about
this and disables password authentication to prevent server spoofing or
man-in-the-middle attacks, which could otherwise be used to circumvent
the encryption. The <strong>StrictHostKeyChecking</strong> option can be used to
control logins to machines whose host key is not known or has changed.</p>
<p>
When the user&#39;s identity has been accepted by the server, the server
either executes the given command in a non-interactive session or, if no
command has been specified, logs into the machine and gives the user a
normal shell as an interactive session. All communication with the
remote command or shell will be automatically encrypted.</p>
<p>
If an interactive session is requested, <strong>ssh</strong> by default will only
request a pseudo-terminal (pty) for interactive sessions when the client
has one. The flags <strong>-T</strong> and <strong>-t</strong> can be used to override this behaviour.</p>
<p>
If a pseudo-terminal has been allocated, the user may use the escape
characters noted below.</p>
<p>
If no pseudo-terminal has been allocated, the session is transparent and
can be used to reliably transfer binary data. On most systems, setting
the escape character to ``none&#39;&#39; will also make the session transparent
even if a tty is used.</p>
<p>
The session terminates when the command or shell on the remote machine
exits and all X11 and TCP connections have been closed.</p>

ESCAPE CHARACTERS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When a pseudo-terminal has been requested, <strong>ssh</strong> supports a number of
functions through the use of an escape character.</p>
<p>
A single tilde character can be sent as <strong>~~</strong> or by following the tilde
by a character other than those described below. The escape character
must always follow a newline to be interpreted as special. The escape
character can be changed in configuration files using the <strong>EscapeChar</strong>
configuration directive or on the command line by the <strong>-e</strong> option.</p>
<p>
The supported escapes (assuming the default `~&#39; ) are:</p>

TCP FORWARDING
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Forwarding of arbitrary TCP connections over a secure channel can be
specified either on the command line or in a configuration file. One
possible application of TCP forwarding is a secure connection to a mail
server; another is going through firewalls.</p>
<p>
In the example below, we look at encrypting communication for an IRC
client, even though the IRC server it connects to does not directly
support encrypted communication. This works as follows: the user
connects to the remote host using <strong>,</strong> specifying the ports to be used to
forward the connection. After that it is possible to start the program
locally, and <strong>ssh</strong> will encrypt and forward the connection to the remote
server.</p>
<p>
The following example tunnels an IRC session from the client to an IRC
server at ``server.example.com&#39;&#39;, joining channel ``#users&#39;&#39;, nickname
``pinky&#39;&#39;, using the standard IRC port, 6667:</p>
<p>
$ ssh -f -L 6667:localhost:6667 server.example.com sleep 10\\
$ irc -c &#39;#users&#39; pinky IRC/127.0.0.1\\</p>
<p>
The <strong>-f</strong> option backgrounds <strong>ssh</strong> and the remote command ``sleep 10&#39;&#39; is
specified to allow an amount of time (10 seconds, in the example) to
start the program which is going to use the tunnel. If no connections
are made within the time specified, <strong>ssh</strong> will exit.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-7">
X11 FORWARDING
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>If the <strong>ForwardX11</strong> variable is set to ``yes&#39;&#39; (or see the description
of the <strong>-X*/,/ *-x*/,/ and *-Y</strong> options above) and the user is using X11
(the <em>DISPLAY</em> environment variable is set), the connection to the X11
display is automatically forwarded to the remote side in such a way that
any X11 programs started from the shell (or command) will go through the
encrypted channel, and the connection to the real X server will be made
from the local machine. The user should not manually set <em>DISPLAY</em>.
Forwarding of X11 connections can be configured on the command line or
in configuration files.</p>
<p>
The <em>DISPLAY</em> value set by <strong>ssh</strong> will point to the server machine, but
with a display number greater than zero. This is normal, and happens
because <strong>ssh</strong> creates a ``proxy&#39;&#39; X server on the server machine for
forwarding the connections over the encrypted channel.</p>
<p>
<strong>ssh</strong> will also automatically set up Xauthority data on the server
machine. For this purpose, it will generate a random authorization
cookie, store it in Xauthority on the server, and verify that any
forwarded connections carry this cookie and replace it by the real
cookie when the connection is opened. The real authentication cookie is
never sent to the server machine (and no cookies are sent in the plain).</p>
<p>
If the <strong>ForwardAgent</strong> variable is set to ``yes&#39;&#39; (or see the description
of the <strong>-A</strong> and <strong>-a</strong> options above) and the user is using an
authentication agent, the connection to the agent is automatically
forwarded to the remote side.</p>

<p>When connecting to a server for the first time, a fingerprint of the
server&#39;s public key is presented to the user (unless the option
<strong>StrictHostKeyChecking</strong> has been disabled). Fingerprints can be
determined using *ssh-keygen*/(1):/</p>
<p>
Dl $ ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key</p>
<p>
If the fingerprint is already known, it can be matched and the key can
be accepted or rejected. If only legacy (MD5) fingerprints for the
server are available, the <strong>ssh-keygen*/(1)/ *-E</strong> option may be used to
downgrade the fingerprint algorithm to match.</p>
<p>
Because of the difficulty of comparing host keys just by looking at
fingerprint strings, there is also support to compare host keys
visually, using <em>random/art</em>./ By setting the <strong>VisualHostKey</strong> option to
``yes&#39;&#39;, a small ASCII graphic gets displayed on every login to a
server, no matter if the session itself is interactive or not. By
learning the pattern a known server produces, a user can easily find out
that the host key has changed when a completely different pattern is
displayed. Because these patterns are not unambiguous however, a pattern
that looks similar to the pattern remembered only gives a good
probability that the host key is the same, not guaranteed proof.</p>
<p>
To get a listing of the fingerprints along with their random art for all
known hosts, the following command line can be used:</p>
<p>
Dl $ ssh-keygen -lv -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts</p>
<p>
If the fingerprint is unknown, an alternative method of verification is
available: SSH fingerprints verified by DNS. An additional resource
record (RR), SSHFP, is added to a zonefile and the connecting client is
able to match the fingerprint with that of the key presented.</p>
<p>
In this example, we are connecting a client to a server,
``host.example.com&#39;&#39;. The SSHFP resource records should first be added
to the zonefile for host.example.com:</p>
<p>
$ ssh-keygen -r host.example.com.\\</p>
<p>
The output lines will have to be added to the zonefile. To check that
the zone is answering fingerprint queries:</p>
<p>
Dl $ dig -t SSHFP host.example.com</p>
<p>
Finally the client connects:</p>
<p>
$ ssh -o &#34;VerifyHostKeyDNS ask&#34; host.example.com<br>
[â€¦]<br>
Matching host key fingerprint found in DNS.<br>
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\\</p>
<p>
See the <strong>VerifyHostKeyDNS</strong> option in *ssh_config*/(5)/ for more
information.</p>

SSH-BASED VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>ssh</strong> contains support for Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnelling
using the *tun*/(4)/ network pseudo-device, allowing two networks to be
joined securely. The <strong>sshd_config*/(5)/ configuration option
*PermitTunnel</strong> controls whether the server supports this, and at what
level (layer 2 or 3 traffic).</p>
<p>
The following example would connect client network 10.0.50.0/24 with
remote network 10.0.99.0/24 using a point-to-point connection from
10.1.1.1 to 10.1.1.2, provided that the SSH server running on the
gateway to the remote network, at 192.168.1.15, allows it.</p>
<p>
On the client:</p>
<p>
â€‹# ssh -f -w 0:1 192.168.1.15 true<br>
â€‹# ifconfig tun0 10.1.1.1 10.1.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.252<br>
â€‹# route add 10.0.99.0/24 10.1.1.2\\</p>
<p>
On the server:</p>
<p>
â€‹# ifconfig tun1 10.1.1.2 10.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.252<br>
â€‹# route add 10.0.50.0/24 10.1.1.1\\</p>
<p>
Client access may be more finely tuned via the
<em>/root</em>.ssh/authorized_keys/ file (see below) and the <strong>PermitRootLogin</strong>
server option. The following entry would permit connections on
<strong>tun*/(4)/ device 1 from user ``jane&#39;&#39; and on tun device 2 from user
``john&#39;&#39;, if *PermitRootLogin</strong> is set to ``forced-commands-only :&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>
tunnel=&#34;1&#34;,command=&#34;sh /etc/netstart tun1&#34; ssh-rsa â€¦ jane<br>
tunnel=&#34;2&#34;,command=&#34;sh /etc/netstart tun2&#34; ssh-rsa â€¦ john\\</p>
<p>
Since an SSH-based setup entails a fair amount of overhead, it may be
more suited to temporary setups, such as for wireless VPNs. More
permanent VPNs are better provided by tools such as *ipsecctl*/(8)/ and
*isakmpd*/(8)./</p>

ENVIRONMENT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>ssh</strong> will normally set the following environment variables:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>DISPLAY</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The <em>DISPLAY</em> variable indicates the location of the X11
server. It is automatically set by <strong>ssh</strong> to point to a value of the
form ``hostname:n&#39;&#39;, where ``hostname&#39;&#39; indicates the host where the
shell runs, and `n&#39; is an integer 1. <strong>ssh</strong> uses this special value to
forward X11 connections over the secure channel. The user should
normally not set <em>DISPLAY</em> explicitly, as that will render the X11
connection insecure (and will require the user to manually copy any
required authorization cookies).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HOME</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set to the path of the user&#39;s home directory.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LOGNAME</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Synonym for <em>USER</em>; set for compatibility with systems
that use this variable.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MAIL</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set to the path of the user&#39;s mailbox.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PATH</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set to the default <em>PATH</em>, as specified when compiling <strong>.</strong></dd>
<dt>
<strong>SSH_ASKPASS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If <strong>ssh</strong> needs a passphrase, it will read the
passphrase from the current terminal if it was run from a terminal. If
<strong>ssh</strong> does not have a terminal associated with it but <em>DISPLAY</em> and
<em>SSH_ASKPASS</em> are set, it will execute the program specified by
<em>SSH_ASKPASS</em> and open an X11 window to read the passphrase. This is
particularly useful when calling <strong>ssh</strong> from a <em>.xsession</em> or related
script. (Note that on some machines it may be necessary to redirect
the input from <em>/dev/null</em> to make this work.)</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Allows further control over the use of an
askpass program. If this variable is set to ``never&#39;&#39; then <strong>ssh</strong> will
never attempt to use one. If it is set to ``prefer&#39;&#39;, then <strong>ssh</strong> will
prefer to use the askpass program instead of the TTY when requesting
passwords. Finally, if the variable is set to ``force&#39;&#39;, then the
askpass program will be used for all passphrase input regardless of
whether <em>DISPLAY</em> is set.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Identifies the path of a UNIX-domain socket used to
communicate with the agent.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SSH_CONNECTION</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Identifies the client and server ends of the
connection. The variable contains four space-separated values: client
IP address, client port number, server IP address, and server port
number.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This variable contains the original command
line if a forced command is executed. It can be used to extract the
original arguments.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SSH_TTY</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is set to the name of the tty (path to the device)
associated with the current shell or command. If the current session
has no tty, this variable is not set.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SSH_TUNNEL</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Optionally set by *sshd*/(8)/ to contain the interface
names assigned if tunnel forwarding was requested by the client.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SSH_USER_AUTH</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Optionally set by *sshd*/(8),/ this variable may
contain a pathname to a file that lists the authentication methods
successfully used when the session was established, including any
public keys that were used.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>TZ</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This variable is set to indicate the present time zone if it
was set when the daemon was started (i.e. the daemon passes the value
on to new connections).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>USER</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set to the name of the user logging in.

Additionally, <strong>ssh</strong> reads <em>~</em>.ssh/environment,/ and adds lines of the
format ``VARNAME=value&#39;&#39; to the environment if the file exists and
users are allowed to change their environment. For more information,
see the <strong>PermitUserEnvironment</strong> option in *sshd_config*/(5)./</dd>
