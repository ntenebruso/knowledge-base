DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>journalctl</strong> is used to print the log entries stored in the journal by
*systemd-journald.service*(8) and *systemd-journal-remote.service*(8).</p>
<p>
If called without parameters, it will show the contents of the journal
accessible to the calling user, starting with the oldest entry
collected.</p>
<p>
If one or more match arguments are passed, the output is filtered
accordingly. A match is in the format &#34;FIELD=VALUE&#34;, e.g.
&#34;_SYSTEMD_UNIT=httpd.service&#34;, referring to the components of a
structured journal entry. See *systemd.journal-fields*(7) for a list of
well-known fields. If multiple matches are specified matching different
fields, the log entries are filtered by both, i.e. the resulting output
will show only entries matching all the specified matches of this kind.
If two matches apply to the same field, then they are automatically
matched as alternatives, i.e. the resulting output will show entries
matching any of the specified matches for the same field. Finally, the
character &#34;+&#34; may appear as a separate word between other terms on the
command line. This causes all matches before and after to be combined in
a disjunction (i.e. logical OR).</p>
<p>
It is also possible to filter the entries by specifying an absolute file
path as an argument. The file path may be a file or a symbolic link and
the file must exist at the time of the query. If a file path refers to
an executable binary, an &#34;_EXE=&#34; match for the canonicalized binary path
is added to the query. If a file path refers to an executable script, a
&#34;_COMM=&#34; match for the script name is added to the query. If a file path
refers to a device node, &#34;_KERNEL_DEVICE=&#34; matches for the kernel name
of the device and for each of its ancestor devices is added to the
query. Symbolic links are dereferenced, kernel names are synthesized,
and parent devices are identified from the environment at the time of
the query. In general, a device node is the best proxy for an actual
device, as log entries do not usually contain fields that identify an
actual device. For the resulting log entries to be correct for the
actual device, the relevant parts of the environment at the time the
entry was logged, in particular the actual device corresponding to the
device node, must have been the same as those at the time of the query.
Because device nodes generally change their corresponding devices across
reboots, specifying a device node path causes the resulting entries to
be restricted to those from the current boot.</p>
<p>
Additional constraints may be added using options <strong>–boot</strong>, <strong>–unit=</strong>,
etc., to further limit what entries will be shown (logical AND).</p>
<p>
Output is interleaved from all accessible journal files, whether they
are rotated or currently being written, and regardless of whether they
belong to the system itself or are accessible user journals. The
<strong>–header</strong> option can be used to identify which files <em>are</em> being shown.</p>
<p>
The set of journal files which will be used can be modified using the
<strong>–user</strong>, <strong>–system</strong>, <strong>–directory=</strong>, and <strong>–file=</strong> options, see below.</p>
<p>
All users are granted access to their private per-user journals.
However, by default, only root and users who are members of a few
special groups are granted access to the system journal and the journals
of other users. Members of the groups &#34;systemd-journal&#34;, &#34;adm&#34;, and
&#34;wheel&#34; can read all journal files. Note that the two latter groups
traditionally have additional privileges specified by the distribution.
Members of the &#34;wheel&#34; group can often perform administrative tasks.</p>
<p>
The output is paged through <strong>less</strong> by default, and long lines are
&#34;truncated&#34; to screen width. The hidden part can be viewed by using the
left-arrow and right-arrow keys. Paging can be disabled; see the
<strong>–no-pager</strong> option and the &#34;Environment&#34; section below.</p>
<p>
When outputting to a tty, lines are colored according to priority: lines
of level ERROR and higher are colored red; lines of level WARNING are
colored yellow; lines of level NOTICE are highlighted; lines of level
INFO are displayed normally; lines of level DEBUG are colored grey.</p>
<p>
To write entries <em>to</em> the journal, a few methods may be used. In
general, output from systemd units is automatically connected to the
journal, see *systemd-journald.service*(8). In addition,
*systemd-cat*(1) may be used to send messages to the journal directly.</p>

SOURCE OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The following options control where to read journal records from:</p>
<p>
<strong>–system</strong>, <strong>–user</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show messages from system services and the kernel (with <strong>–system</strong>).
Show messages from service of current user (with <strong>–user</strong>). If neither
is specified, show all messages that the user can see.</p>
<p>
The <strong>–user</strong> option affects how <strong>–unit=</strong> arguments are treated. See
<strong>–unit=</strong>.</p>
<p>
Note that <strong>–user</strong> only works if persistent logging is enabled, via the
<em>Storage=</em> setting in *journald.conf*(5).</p>
<p>
Added in version 205.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-M</strong>, <strong>–machine=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show messages from a running, local container. Specify a container name
to connect to.</p>
<p>
Added in version 209.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-m</strong>, <strong>–merge</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show entries interleaved from all available journals, including remote
ones.</p>
<p>
Added in version 190.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*-D */DIR/, *–directory=*/DIR/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a directory path as argument. If specified, journalctl will
operate on the specified journal directory <em>DIR</em> instead of the default
runtime and system journal paths.</p>
<p>
Added in version 187.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*-i */GLOB/, *–file=*/GLOB/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a file glob as an argument. If specified, journalctl will operate
on the specified journal files matching <em>GLOB</em> instead of the default
runtime and system journal paths. May be specified multiple times, in
which case files will be suitably interleaved.</p>
<p>
Added in version 205.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–root=*/ROOT/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a directory path as an argument. If specified, <strong>journalctl</strong> will
operate on journal directories and catalog file hierarchy underneath the
specified directory instead of the root directory (e.g.
<strong>–update-catalog</strong> will create <em>ROOT//var/lib/systemd/catalog/database,
and journal files under /ROOT//run/journal</em> or <em>ROOT//var/log/journal</em>
will be displayed).</p>
<p>
Added in version 201.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–image=*/IMAGE/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a path to a disk image file or block device node. If specified,
<strong>journalctl</strong> will operate on the file system in the indicated disk
image. This option is similar to <strong>–root=</strong>, but operates on file systems
stored in disk images or block devices, thus providing an easy way to
extract log data from disk images. The disk image should either contain
just a file system or a set of file systems within a GPT partition
table, following the <strong>Discoverable Partitions Specification</strong>[1]. For
further information on supported disk images, see *systemd-nspawn*(1)s
switch of the same name.</p>
<p>
Added in version 247.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–image-policy=*/policy/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes an image policy string as argument, as per
<strong>systemd.image-policy*(7). The policy is enforced when operating on the
disk image specified via *–image=</strong>, see above. If not specified
defaults to the &#34;*&#34; policy, i.e. all recognized file systems in the
image are used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–namespace=*/NAMESPACE/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a journal namespace identifier string as argument. If not
specified the data collected by the default namespace is shown. If
specified shows the log data of the specified namespace instead. If the
namespace is specified as &#34;*&#34; data from all namespaces is shown,
interleaved. If the namespace identifier is prefixed with &#34;+&#34; data from
the specified namespace and the default namespace is shown, interleaved,
but no other. For details about journal namespaces see
*systemd-journald.service*(8).</p>
<p>
Added in version 245.</p>

FILTERING OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The following options control how to filter journal records:</p>
<p>
<strong>-S</strong>, <strong>–since=</strong>, <strong>-U</strong>, <strong>–until=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Start showing entries on or newer than the specified date, or on or
older than the specified date, respectively. Date specifications should
be of the format &#34;2012-10-30 18:17:16&#34;. If the time part is omitted,
&#34;00:00:00&#34; is assumed. If only the seconds component is omitted, &#34;:00&#34;
is assumed. If the date component is omitted, the current day is
assumed. Alternatively the strings &#34;yesterday&#34;, &#34;today&#34;, &#34;tomorrow&#34; are
understood, which refer to 00:00:00 of the day before the current day,
the current day, or the day after the current day, respectively. &#34;now&#34;
refers to the current time. Finally, relative times may be specified,
prefixed with &#34;-&#34; or &#34;+&#34;, referring to times before or after the current
time, respectively. For complete time and date specification, see
<strong>systemd.time*(7). Note that *–output=short-full</strong> prints timestamps
that follow precisely this format.</p>
<p>
Added in version 195.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-c</strong>, <strong>–cursor=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Start showing entries from the location in the journal specified by the
passed cursor.</p>
<p>
Added in version 193.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–after-cursor=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Start showing entries from the location in the journal <em>after</em> the
location specified by the passed cursor. The cursor is shown when the
<strong>–show-cursor</strong> option is used.</p>
<p>
Added in version 206.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–cursor-file=*/FILE/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <em>FILE</em> exists and contains a cursor, start showing entries <em>after</em>
this location. Otherwise show entries according to the other given
options. At the end, write the cursor of the last entry to <em>FILE</em>. Use
this option to continually read the journal by sequentially calling
<strong>journalctl</strong>.</p>
<p>
Added in version 242.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*-b [[*/ID/][/±offset/]|*all*], *–boot[=[*/ID/][/±offset/]|*all*]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show messages from a specific boot. This will add a match for
&#34;_BOOT_ID=&#34;.</p>
<p>
The argument may be empty, in which case logs for the current boot will
be shown.</p>
<p>
If the boot ID is omitted, a positive <em>offset</em> will look up the boots
starting from the beginning of the journal, and an equal-or-less-than
zero <em>offset</em> will look up boots starting from the end of the journal.
Thus, <strong>1</strong> means the first boot found in the journal in chronological
order, <strong>2</strong> the second and so on; while <strong>-0</strong> is the last boot, <strong>-1</strong> the
boot before last, and so on. An empty <em>offset</em> is equivalent to
specifying <strong>-0</strong>, except when the current boot is not the last boot (e.g.
because <strong>–directory=</strong> was specified to look at logs from a different
machine).</p>
<p>
If the 32-character <em>ID</em> is specified, it may optionally be followed by
<em>offset</em> which identifies the boot relative to the one given by boot
<em>ID</em>. Negative values mean earlier boots and positive values mean later
boots. If <em>offset</em> is not specified, a value of zero is assumed, and the
logs for the boot given by <em>ID</em> are shown.</p>
<p>
The special argument <strong>all</strong> can be used to negate the effect of an
earlier use of <strong>-b</strong>.</p>
<p>
Added in version 186.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-u</strong>, *–unit=*/UNIT/*|*/PATTERN/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show messages for the specified systemd unit <em>UNIT</em> (such as a service
unit), or for any of the units matched by <em>PATTERN</em>. If a pattern is
specified, a list of unit names found in the journal is compared with
the specified pattern and all that match are used. For each unit name, a
match is added for messages from the unit (&#34;_SYSTEMD_UNIT=/UNIT/&#34;),
along with additional matches for messages from systemd and messages
about coredumps for the specified unit. A match is also added for
&#34;_SYSTEMD_SLICE=/UNIT/&#34;, such that if the provided <em>UNIT</em> is a
*systemd.slice*(5) unit, all logs of children of the slice will be
shown.</p>
<p>
With <strong>–user</strong>, all <strong>–unit=</strong> arguments will be converted to match user
messages as if specified with <strong>–user-unit=</strong>.</p>
<p>
This parameter can be specified multiple times.</p>
<p>
Added in version 195.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–user-unit=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show messages for the specified user session unit. This will add a match
for messages from the unit (&#34;_SYSTEMD_USER_UNIT=&#34; and &#34;_UID=&#34;) and
additional matches for messages from session systemd and messages about
coredumps for the specified unit. A match is also added for
&#34;_SYSTEMD_USER_SLICE=/UNIT/&#34;, such that if the provided <em>UNIT</em> is a
*systemd.slice*(5) unit, all logs of children of the unit will be shown.</p>
<p>
This parameter can be specified multiple times.</p>
<p>
Added in version 198.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-t</strong>, *–identifier=*/SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show messages for the specified syslog identifier <em>SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER</em>.</p>
<p>
This parameter can be specified multiple times.</p>
<p>
Added in version 217.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-T</strong>, *–exclude-identifier=*/SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exclude messages for the specified syslog identifier
<em>SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER</em>.</p>
<p>
This parameter can be specified multiple times.</p>
<p>
Added in version 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-p</strong>, <strong>–priority=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Filter output by message priorities or priority ranges. Takes either a
single numeric or textual log level (i.e. between 0/&#34;emerg&#34; and
7/&#34;debug&#34;), or a range of numeric/text log levels in the form FROM..TO.
The log levels are the usual syslog log levels as documented in
*syslog*(3), i.e. &#34;emerg&#34; (0), &#34;alert&#34; (1), &#34;crit&#34; (2), &#34;err&#34; (3),
&#34;warning&#34; (4), &#34;notice&#34; (5), &#34;info&#34; (6), &#34;debug&#34; (7). If a single log
level is specified, all messages with this log level or a lower (hence
more important) log level are shown. If a range is specified, all
messages within the range are shown, including both the start and the
end value of the range. This will add &#34;PRIORITY=&#34; matches for the
specified priorities.</p>
<p>
Added in version 188.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–facility=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Filter output by syslog facility. Takes a comma-separated list of
numbers or facility names. The names are the usual syslog facilities as
documented in <strong>syslog*(3). *–facility=help</strong> may be used to display a
list of known facility names and exit.</p>
<p>
Added in version 245.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-g</strong>, <strong>–grep=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Filter output to entries where the <em>MESSAGE=</em> field matches the
specified regular expression. PERL-compatible regular expressions are
used, see *pcre2pattern*(3) for a detailed description of the syntax.</p>
<p>
If the pattern is all lowercase, matching is case insensitive.
Otherwise, matching is case sensitive. This can be overridden with the
<strong>–case-sensitive</strong> option, see below.</p>
<p>
When used with <strong>–lines=</strong> (not prefixed with &#34;+&#34;), <strong>–reverse</strong> is
implied.</p>
<p>
Added in version 237.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–case-sensitive[=BOOLEAN]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make pattern matching case sensitive or case insensitive.</p>
<p>
Added in version 237.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-k</strong>, <strong>–dmesg</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show only kernel messages. This implies <strong>-b</strong> and adds the match
&#34;_TRANSPORT=kernel&#34;.</p>

OUTPUT OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The following options control how journal records are printed:</p>

<strong>-o</strong>, <strong>–output=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Controls the formatting of the journal entries that are shown. Takes one
of the following options:</p>
<p>
<strong>short</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>is the default and generates an output that is mostly identical to the
formatting of classic syslog files, showing one line per journal entry.</p>
<p>
Added in version 206.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>short-full</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>is very similar, but shows timestamps in the format the <strong>–since=</strong> and
<strong>–until=</strong> options accept. Unlike the timestamp information shown in
<strong>short</strong> output mode this mode includes weekday, year and timezone
information in the output, and is locale-independent.</p>
<p>
Added in version 232.</p>
</blockquote>

<strong>short-iso</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>is very similar, but shows timestamps in the <strong>RFC 3339</strong>[2] profile of
ISO 8601.</p>
<p>
Added in version 206.</p>

<p>
Added in version 252.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>short-unix</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>is very similar, but shows seconds passed since January 1st 1970 UTC
instead of wallclock timestamps (&#34;UNIX time&#34;). The time is shown with
microsecond accuracy.</p>
<p>
Added in version 230.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>verbose</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>shows the full-structured entry items with all fields.</p>

Added in version 206.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>export</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>serializes the journal into a binary (but mostly text-based) stream
suitable for backups and network transfer (see <strong>Journal Export
Format</strong>[3] for more information). To import the binary stream back into
native journald format use *systemd-journal-remote*(8).</p>
<p>
Added in version 206.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>json</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>formats entries as JSON objects, separated by newline characters (see
<strong>Journal JSON Format</strong>[4] for more information). Field values are
generally encoded as JSON strings, with three exceptions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Fields larger than 4096 bytes are encoded as <strong>null</strong> values. (This may be
turned off by passing <strong>–all</strong>, but be aware that this may allocate
overly long JSON objects.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Journal entries permit non-unique fields within the same log entry. JSON
does not allow non-unique fields within objects. Due to this, if a
non-unique field is encountered a JSON array is used as field value,
listing all field values as elements.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Fields containing non-printable or non-UTF8 bytes are encoded as arrays
containing the raw bytes individually formatted as unsigned numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that this encoding is reversible (with the exception of the size
limit).</p>
<p>
Added in version 206.</p>

<p>
<strong>json-pretty</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>formats entries as JSON data structures, but formats them in multiple
lines in order to make them more readable by humans.</p>
<p>
Added in version 206.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>json-sse</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>formats entries as JSON data structures, but wraps them in a format
suitable for <strong>Server-Sent Events</strong>[5].</p>
<p>
Added in version 206.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>json-seq</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>formats entries as JSON data structures, but prefixes them with an ASCII
Record Separator character (0x1E) and suffixes them with an ASCII Line
Feed character (0x0A), in accordance with <strong>JavaScript Object Notation
(JSON) Text Sequences</strong>[6] (&#34;application/json-seq&#34;).</p>
<p>
Added in version 240.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>cat</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>generates a very terse output, only showing the actual message of each
journal entry with no metadata, not even a timestamp. If combined with
the <strong>–output-fields=</strong> option will output the listed fields for each log
record, instead of the message.</p>
<p>
Added in version 206.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>with-unit</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>similar to <strong>short-full</strong>, but prefixes the unit and user unit names
instead of the traditional syslog identifier. Useful when using
templated instances, as it will include the arguments in the unit names.</p>
<p>
Added in version 239.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–truncate-newline</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Truncate each log message at the first newline character on output, so
that only the first line of each message is displayed.</p>
<p>
Added in version 254.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–output-fields=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A comma separated list of the fields which should be included in the
output. This has an effect only for the output modes which would
normally show all fields (<strong>verbose</strong>, <strong>export</strong>, <strong>json</strong>, <strong>json-pretty</strong>,
<strong>json-sse</strong> and <strong>json-seq</strong>), as well as on <strong>cat</strong>. For the former, the
&#34;__CURSOR&#34;, &#34;__REALTIME_TIMESTAMP&#34;, &#34;__MONOTONIC_TIMESTAMP&#34;, and

<strong>-n</strong>, <strong>–lines=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the most recent journal events and limit the number of events
shown. The argument is a positive integer or &#34;all&#34; to disable the limit.
Additionally, if the number is prefixed with &#34;+&#34;, the oldest journal
events are used instead. The default value is 10 if no argument is
given.</p>
<p>
If <strong>–follow</strong> is used, this option is implied. When not prefixed with

<p>The following commands are understood. If none is specified the default
is to display journal records:</p>
<p>
<strong>-N</strong>, <strong>–fields</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print all field names currently used in all entries of the journal.</p>
<p>
Added in version 229.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–list-boots</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show a tabular list of boot numbers (relative to the current boot),
their IDs, and the timestamps of the first and last message pertaining
to the boot. When specified with *-n/–lines=[+]*/N/ option, only the
first (when the number prefixed with &#34;+&#34;) or the last (without prefix)
<em>N</em> entries will be shown. When specified with <strong>-r/–reverse</strong>, the list
will be shown in the reverse order.</p>
<p>
Added in version 209.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–disk-usage</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shows the current disk usage of all journal files. This shows the sum of
the disk usage of all archived and active journal files.</p>
<p>
Added in version 190.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–vacuum-size=</strong>, <strong>–vacuum-time=</strong>, <strong>–vacuum-files=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>–vacuum-size=</strong> removes the oldest archived journal files until the
disk space they use falls below the specified size. Accepts the usual
&#34;K&#34;, &#34;M&#34;, &#34;G&#34; and &#34;T&#34; suffixes (to the base of 1024).</p>
<p>
<strong>–vacuum-time=</strong> removes archived journal files older than the specified
timespan. Accepts the usual &#34;s&#34; (default), &#34;m&#34;, &#34;h&#34;, &#34;days&#34;, &#34;weeks&#34;,
&#34;months&#34;, and &#34;years&#34; suffixes, see *systemd.time*(7) for details.</p>
<p>
<strong>–vacuum-files=</strong> leaves only the specified number of separate journal
files.</p>
<p>
Note that running <strong>–vacuum-size=</strong> has only an indirect effect on the
output shown by <strong>–disk-usage</strong>, as the latter includes active journal
files, while the vacuuming operation only operates on archived journal
files. Similarly, <strong>–vacuum-files=</strong> might not actually reduce the number
of journal files to below the specified number, as it will not remove
active journal files.</p>
<p>
<strong>–vacuum-size=</strong>, <strong>–vacuum-time=</strong> and <strong>–vacuum-files=</strong> may be combined
in a single invocation to enforce any combination of a size, a time and
a number of files limit on the archived journal files. Specifying any of
these three parameters as zero is equivalent to not enforcing the
specific limit, and is thus redundant.</p>
<p>
These three switches may also be combined with <strong>–rotate</strong> into one
command. If so, all active files are rotated first, and the requested
vacuuming operation is executed right after. The rotation has the effect
that all currently active files are archived (and potentially new, empty
journal files opened as replacement), and hence the vacuuming operation
has the greatest effect as it can take all log data written so far into
account.</p>
<p>
Added in version 218.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–verify</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Check the journal file for internal consistency. If the file has been
generated with FSS enabled and the FSS verification key has been
specified with <strong>–verify-key=</strong>, authenticity of the journal file is
verified.</p>
<p>
Added in version 189.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–sync</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asks the journal daemon to write all yet unwritten journal data to the
backing file system and synchronize all journals. This call does not
return until the synchronization operation is complete. This command
guarantees that any log messages written before its invocation are
safely stored on disk at the time it returns.</p>
<p>
Added in version 228.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–relinquish-var</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asks the journal daemon for the reverse operation to <strong>–flush</strong>: if
requested the daemon will write further log data to <em>run/log/journal</em>
and stops writing to <em>var/log/journal</em>. A subsequent call to <strong>–flush</strong>
causes the log output to switch back to <em>var/log/journal</em>, see above.</p>
<p>
Added in version 243.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–smart-relinquish-var</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similar to <strong>–relinquish-var</strong>, but executes no operation if the root
file system and <em>var/log/journal</em> reside on the same mount point. This
operation is used during system shutdown in order to make the journal
daemon stop writing data to <em>var/log/journal</em> in case that directory is
located on a mount point that needs to be unmounted.</p>
<p>
Added in version 243.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–flush</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asks the journal daemon to flush any log data stored in
<em>run/log/journal</em> into <em>var/log/journal</em>, if persistent storage is
enabled. This call does not return until the operation is complete. Note
that this call is idempotent: the data is only flushed from
<em>run/log/journal</em> into <em>var/log/journal</em> once during system runtime (but
see <strong>–relinquish-var</strong> below), and this command exits cleanly without
executing any operation if this has already happened. This command
effectively guarantees that all data is flushed to <em>var/log/journal</em> at
the time it returns.</p>
<p>
Added in version 217.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–rotate</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asks the journal daemon to rotate journal files. This call does not
return until the rotation operation is complete. Journal file rotation
has the effect that all currently active journal files are marked as
archived and renamed, so that they are never written to in future. New
(empty) journal files are then created in their place. This operation
may be combined with <strong>–vacuum-size=</strong>, <strong>–vacuum-time=</strong> and
<strong>–vacuum-file=</strong> into a single command, see above.</p>
<p>
Added in version 227.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–header</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of showing journal contents, show internal header information of
the journal fields accessed.</p>
<p>
This option is particularly useful when trying to identify out-of-order
journal entries, as happens for example when the machine is booted with
the wrong system time.</p>
<p>
Added in version 187.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–list-catalog [*/128-bit-ID…/]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>List the contents of the message catalog as a table of message IDs, plus
their short description strings.</p>

If any /128-bit-ID/s are specified, only those entries are shown.</p>
<p>
Added in version 196.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–dump-catalog [*/128-bit-ID…/]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the contents of the message catalog, with entries separated by a
line consisting of two dashes and the ID (the format is the same as
.catalog files).</p>
<p>
If any /128-bit-ID/s are specified, only those entries are shown.</p>
<p>
Added in version 199.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–update-catalog</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update the message catalog index. This command needs to be executed each
time new catalog files are installed, removed, or updated to rebuild the
binary catalog index.</p>
<p>
Added in version 196.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–setup-keys</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of showing journal contents, generate a new key pair for Forward
Secure Sealing (FSS). This will generate a sealing key and a
verification key. The sealing key is stored in the journal data
directory and shall remain on the host. The verification key should be
stored externally. Refer to the <strong>Seal=</strong> option in *journald.conf*(5) for
information on Forward Secure Sealing and for a link to a refereed
scholarly paper detailing the cryptographic theory it is based on.</p>

<p><em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a higher log
level, i.e. less important ones, will be suppressed). Takes a
comma-separated list of values. A value may be either one of (in order
of decreasing importance) <strong>emerg</strong>, <strong>alert</strong>, <strong>crit</strong>, <strong>err</strong>, <strong>warning</strong>,
<strong>notice</strong>, <strong>info</strong>, <strong>debug</strong>, or an integer in the range 0…7. See
<strong>syslog*(3) for more information. Each value may optionally be prefixed
with one of *console</strong>, <strong>syslog</strong>, <strong>kmsg</strong> or <strong>journal</strong> followed by a colon
to set the maximum log level for that specific log target (e.g.
<strong>SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug,console:info</strong> specifies to log at debug level
except when logging to the console which should be at info level). Note
that the global maximum log level takes priority over any per target
maximum log levels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be colored
according to priority.</p>
<p>
This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the
terminal, because *journalctl*(1) and other tools that display logs will
color messages based on the log level on their own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed with a
timestamp.</p>
<p>
This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the
terminal or a file, because *journalctl*(1) and other tools that display
logs will attach timestamps based on the entry metadata on their own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename and line
number in the source code where the message originates.</p>
<p>
Note that the log location is often attached as metadata to journal
entries anyway. Including it directly in the message text can
nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TID</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with the current numerical
thread ID (TID).</p>
<p>
Note that the this information is attached as metadata to journal
entries anyway. Including it directly in the message text can
nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The destination for log messages. One of <strong>console</strong> (log to the attached
tty), <strong>console-prefixed</strong> (log to the attached tty but with prefixes
encoding the log level and &#34;facility&#34;, see <strong>syslog*(3), *kmsg</strong> (log to
the kernel circular log buffer), <strong>journal</strong> (log to the journal),
<strong>journal-or-kmsg</strong> (log to the journal if available, and to kmsg
otherwise), <strong>auto</strong> (determine the appropriate log target automatically,
the default), <strong>null</strong> (disable log output).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_RATELIMIT_KMSG</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether to ratelimit kmsg or not. Takes a boolean. Defaults to &#34;true&#34;.
If disabled, systemd will not ratelimit messages written to kmsg.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pager to use when <strong>–no-pager</strong> is not given; overrides <em>$PAGER</em>. If
neither <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</em> nor <em>$PAGER</em> are set, a set of well-known pager
implementations are tried in turn, including *less*(1) and *more*(1),
until one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is
invoked. Setting this environment variable to an empty string or the
value &#34;cat&#34; is equivalent to passing <strong>–no-pager</strong>.</p>
<p>
Note: if <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em> is not set, <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</em> (as well as
<em>$PAGER</em>) will be silently ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LESS</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Override the options passed to <strong>less</strong> (by default &#34;FRSXMK&#34;).</p>
<p>
Users might want to change two options in particular:</p>
<p>
<strong>K</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when Ctrl+C is
pressed. To allow <strong>less</strong> to handle Ctrl+C itself to switch back to the
pager command prompt, unset this option.</p>
<p>
If the value of <em>$SYSTEMD_LESS</em> does not include &#34;K&#34;, and the pager that
is invoked is <strong>less</strong>, Ctrl+C will be ignored by the executable, and
needs to be handled by the pager.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>X</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option instructs the pager to not send termcap initialization and
deinitialization strings to the terminal. It is set by default to allow
command output to remain visible in the terminal even after the pager
exits. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager functionality from
working, in particular paged output cannot be scrolled with the mouse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that setting the regular <em>$LESS</em> environment variable has no effect
for <strong>less</strong> invocations by systemd tools.</p>
<p>
See *less*(1) for more discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Override the charset passed to <strong>less</strong> (by default &#34;utf-8&#34;, if the
invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).</p>
<p>
Note that setting the regular <em>$LESSCHARSET</em> environment variable has no
effect for <strong>less</strong> invocations by systemd tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument. When true, the &#34;secure&#34; mode of the pager is
enabled; if false, disabled. If <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em> is not set at
all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the
owner of the login session, see <strong>geteuid*(2) and
*sd_pid_get_owner_uid*(3). In secure mode, *LESSSECURE=1</strong> will be set
when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open
or create new files or start new subprocesses. When
<em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em> is not set at all, pagers which are not known to
implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only *less*(1)
implements secure mode.)</p>
<p>
Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for example
under *sudo*(8) or *pkexec*(1), care must be taken to ensure that
unintended interactive features are not enabled. &#34;Secure&#34; mode for the
pager may be enabled automatically as describe above. Setting
<em>SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0</em> or not removing it from the inherited
environment allows the user to invoke arbitrary commands. Note that if
the <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</em> or <em>$PAGER</em> variables are to be honoured,
<em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em> must be set too. It might be reasonable to
completely disable the pager using <strong>–no-pager</strong> instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_COLORS</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument. When true, <strong>systemd</strong> and related utilities
will use colors in their output, otherwise the output will be
monochrome. Additionally, the variable can take one of the following
special values: &#34;16&#34;, &#34;256&#34; to restrict the use of colors to the base 16
or 256 ANSI colors, respectively. This can be specified to override the
automatic decision based on <em>$TERM</em> and what the console is connected
to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_URLIFY</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should be
generated in the output for terminal emulators supporting this. This can
be specified to override the decision that <strong>systemd</strong> makes based on
<em>$TERM</em> and other conditions.</p>

EXAMPLES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Without arguments, all collected logs are shown unfiltered:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
journalctl
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
With one match specified, all entries with a field matching the
expression are shown:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=avahi-daemon.service
journalctl _SYSTEMD_CGROUP=/user.slice/user-42.slice/session-c1.scope
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If two different fields are matched, only entries matching both
expressions at the same time are shown:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=avahi-daemon.service _PID=28097
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If two matches refer to the same field, all entries matching either
expression are shown:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=avahi-daemon.service _SYSTEMD_UNIT=dbus.service
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If the separator &#34;+&#34; is used, two expressions may be combined in a
logical OR. The following will show all messages from the Avahi service
process with the PID 28097 plus all messages from the D-Bus service
(from any of its processes):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=avahi-daemon.service _PID=28097 + _SYSTEMD_UNIT=dbus.service
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
To show all fields emitted <em>by</em> a unit and <em>about</em> the unit, option
<strong>-u*/</strong>–unit=* should be used. *journalctl -u */name/ expands to a
complex filter similar to</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
_SYSTEMD_UNIT=name.service
  + UNIT=name.service _PID=1
  + OBJECT_SYSTEMD_UNIT=name.service _UID=0
  + COREDUMP_UNIT=name.service _UID=0 MESSAGE_ID=fc2e22bc6ee647b6b90729ab34a250b1
