DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>systemd-cryptenroll</strong> is a tool for enrolling hardware security tokens
and devices into a LUKS2 encrypted volume, which may then be used to
unlock the volume during boot. Specifically, it supports tokens and
credentials of the following kind to be enrolled:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>PKCS#11 security tokens and smartcards that may carry an RSA or EC key
pair (e.g. various YubiKeys)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>FIDO2 security tokens that implement the &#34;hmac-secret&#34; extension (most
FIDO2 keys, including YubiKeys)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>TPM2 security devices</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Regular passphrases</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Recovery keys. These are similar to regular passphrases, however are
randomly generated on the computer and thus generally have higher
entropy than user-chosen passphrases. Their character set has been
designed to ensure they are easy to type in, while having high entropy.
They may also be scanned off screen using QR codes. Recovery keys may be
used for unlocking LUKS2 volumes wherever passphrases are accepted. They
are intended to be used in combination with an enrolled hardware
security token, as a recovery option when the token is lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In addition, the tool may be used to enumerate currently enrolled
security tokens and wipe a subset of them. The latter may be combined
with the enrollment operation of a new security token, in order to
update or replace enrollments.</p>
<p>
The tool supports only LUKS2 volumes, as it stores token
meta-information in the LUKS2 JSON token area, which is not available in
other encryption formats.</p>
<p>
<strong>systemd-cryptsetup</strong> operates on the device backing <em>var</em> if no device
is specified explicitly, and no wipe operation is requested. (Note that
in the typical case where <em>var</em> is on the same file system as the root
file system, this hence enrolls a key into the backing device of the
root file system.)</p>

TPM2 PCRs and policies
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p>PCRs allow binding of the encryption of secrets to specific software
versions and system state, so that the enrolled key is only accessible
(may be &#34;unsealed&#34;) if specific trusted software and/or configuration is
used. Such bindings may be created with the option <strong>–tpm2-pcrs=</strong>
described below.</p>
<p>
Secrets may also be bound indirectly: a signed policy for a state of
some combination of PCR values is provided, and the secret is bound to
the public part of the key used to sign this policy. This means that the
owner of a key can generate a sequence of signed policies, for specific
software versions and system states, and the secret can be decrypted as
long as the machine state matches one of those policies. For example, a
vendor may provide such a policy for each kernel+initrd update, allowing
users to encrypt secrets so that they can be decrypted when running any
kernel+initrd signed by the vendor. Such bindings may be created with
the options <strong>–tpm2-public-key=</strong>, <strong>–tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</strong>,
<strong>–tpm2-signature=</strong> described below.</p>
<p>
See <strong>Linux TPM PCR Registry</strong>[1] for an authoritative list of PCRs and
how they are updated. The table below contains a quick reference,
describing in particular the PCRs modified by systemd.</p>

<p>
In general, encrypted volumes would be bound to some combination of PCRs
7, 11, and 14 (if shim/MOK is used). In order to allow firmware and OS
version updates, it is typically not advisable to use PCRs such as 0 and
2, since the program code they cover should already be covered
indirectly through the certificates measured into PCR 7. Validation
through certificates hashes is typically preferable over validation
through direct measurements as it is less brittle in context of
OS/firmware updates: the measurements will change on every update, but
signatures should remain unchanged. See the <strong>Linux TPM PCR Registry</strong>[1]
for more discussion.</p>

LIMITATIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Note that currently when enrolling a new key of one of the five
supported types listed above, it is required to first provide a
passphrase, a recovery key, a FIDO2 token, or a TPM2 key. Its currently
not supported to unlock a device with a PKCS#11 key in order to enroll a
new PKCS#11 key. Thus, if in future key roll-over is desired its
generally recommended to ensure a passphrase, a recovery key, a FIDO2
token, or a TPM2 key is always enrolled.</p>
<p>
Also note that support for enrolling multiple FIDO2 tokens is currently
limited. When multiple FIDO2 tokens are enrolled, <strong>systemd-cryptsetup</strong>
will perform pre-flight requests to attempt to identify which of the
enrolled tokens are currently plugged in. However, this is not possible
for FIDO2 tokens with user verification (UV, usually via biometrics), in
which case it will fall back to attempting each enrolled token one by
one. This will result in multiple prompts for PIN and user verification.
This limitation does not apply to PKCS#11 tokens.</p>

<h2 id="headline-6">
COMPATIBILITY
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Security technology both in systemd and in the general industry
constantly evolves. In order to provide best security guarantees, the
way TPM2, FIDO2, PKCS#11 devices are enrolled is regularly updated in
newer versions of systemd. Whenever this happens the following
compatibility guarantees are given:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Old enrollments continue to be supported and may be unlocked with newer
versions of *systemd-cryptsetup@.service*(8).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
The opposite is not guaranteed however: it might not be possible to
unlock volumes with enrollments done with a newer version of
<strong>systemd-cryptenroll</strong> with an older version of <strong>systemd-cryptsetup</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That said, it is generally recommended to use matching versions of
<strong>systemd-cryptenroll</strong> and <strong>systemd-cryptsetup</strong>, since this is best
tested and supported.</p>
<p>
It might be advisable to re-enroll existing enrollments to take benefit
of newer security features, as they are added to systemd.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The following options are understood:</p>
<p>
<strong>–password</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enroll a regular password/passphrase. This command is mostly equivalent
to <strong>cryptsetup luksAddKey</strong>, however may be combined with <strong>–wipe-slot=</strong>
in one call, see below.</p>
<p>
Added in version 248.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–recovery-key</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enroll a recovery key. Recovery keys are mostly identical to
passphrases, but are computer-generated instead of being chosen by a
human, and thus have a guaranteed high entropy. The key uses a character
set that is easy to type in, and may be scanned off screen via a QR
code.</p>
<p>
Added in version 248.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–unlock-key-file=*/PATH/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use a file instead of a password/passphrase read from stdin to unlock
the volume. Expects the PATH to the file containing your key to unlock
the volume. Currently there is nothing like <strong>–key-file-offset=</strong> or
<strong>–key-file-size=</strong> so this file has to only contain the full key.</p>
<p>
Added in version 252.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–unlock-fido2-device=*/PATH/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use a FIDO2 device instead of a password/passphrase read from stdin to
unlock the volume. Expects a hidraw device referring to the FIDO2 device
(e.g. /dev/hidraw1). Alternatively the special value &#34;auto&#34; may be
specified, in order to automatically determine the device node of a
currently plugged in security token (of which there must be exactly
one). This automatic discovery is unsupported if <strong>–fido2-device=</strong>
option is also specified.</p>
<p>
Added in version 253.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–unlock-tpm2-device=*/PATH/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use a TPM2 device instead of a password/passhprase read from stdin to
unlock the volume. Expects a device node path referring to the TPM2 chip
(e.g. /dev/tpmrm0). Alternatively the special value &#34;auto&#34; may be
specified, in order to automatically determine the device node of a
currently discovered TPM2 device (of which there must be exactly one).</p>
<p>
Added in version 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–pkcs11-token-uri=*/URI/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enroll a PKCS#11 security token or smartcard (e.g. a YubiKey). Expects a
PKCS#11 URI that allows finding an X.509 certificate or a public key on
the token. The URI must also be suitable to find a related private key
after changing the type of object in it. Alternatively the special value
&#34;auto&#34; may be specified, in order to automatically determine the
suitable URI if a single security token containing a single key pair is
plugged in. The special value &#34;list&#34; may be used to enumerate all
suitable PKCS#11 tokens currently plugged in.</p>
<p>
The PKCS#11 token must contain an RSA or EC key pair which will be used
to unlock a LUKS2 volume. For RSA, a randomly generated volume key is
encrypted with a public key in the token, and stored in the LUKS2 JSON
token header area. To unlock a volume, the stored encrypted volume key
will be decrypted with a private key in the token. For ECC, ECDH
algorithm is used: we generate a pair of EC keys in the same EC group,
then derive a shared secret using the generated private key and the
public key in the token. The derived shared secret is used as a volume
key. The generated public key is stored in the LUKS2 JSON token header
area. The generated private key is erased. To unlock a volume, we derive
the shared secret with the stored public key and a private key in the
token.</p>
<p>
In order to unlock a LUKS2 volume with an enrolled PKCS#11 security
token, specify the <strong>pkcs11-uri=</strong> option in the respective /etc/crypttab
line:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
myvolume /dev/sda1 - pkcs11-uri=auto

<p>Enroll a TPM2 security chip using its public key. Expects a path
referring to the TPM2 public key in TPM2B_PUBLIC format. This cannot be
used with <strong>–tpm2-device=</strong>, as it performs the same operation, but
without connecting to the TPM2 security chip; instead the enrollment is
calculated using the provided TPM2 key. This is useful in situations
where the TPM2 security chip is not available at the time of enrollment.</p>
<p>
The key, in most cases, should be the Storage Root Key (SRK) from a
local TPM2 security chip. If a key from a different handle (not the SRK)
is used, you must specify its handle index using
<strong>–tpm2-seal-key-handle=</strong>.</p>

/run/systemd/tpm2-srk-public-key.tpm2b_public automatically during boot,
in the correct format.</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you may use <strong>systemd-analyze srk</strong> to retrieve the SRK
from the TPM2 security chip explicitly. See *systemd-analyze*(1) for
details. Example:</p>

<p>Configures which parent key to use for sealing, using the TPM handle
(index) of the key. This is used to &#34;seal&#34; (encrypt) a secret and must
be used later to &#34;unseal&#34; (decrypt) the secret. Expects a hexadecimal
32bit integer, optionally prefixed with &#34;0x&#34;. Allowable values are any
handle index in the persistent (&#34;0x81000000&#34;-&#34;0x81ffffff&#34;) or transient
(&#34;0x80000000&#34;-&#34;0x80ffffff&#34;) ranges. Since transient handles are lost
after a TPM reset, and may be flushed during TPM context switching, they
should not be used except for very specific use cases, e.g. testing.</p>
<p>
The default is the Storage Root Key (SRK) handle index &#34;0x81000001&#34;. A
value of 0 will use the default. For the SRK handle, a new key will be
created and stored in the TPM if one does not already exist; for any
other handle, the key must already exist in the TPM at the specified

specific PCR values; the latter binds decryption to any set of PCR
values for which a signature by the specified public key can be
provided. The latter is hence more useful in scenarios where software
updates shell be possible without losing access to all previously
encrypted LUKS2 volumes. Like with <strong>–tpm2-pcrs=</strong>, names defined in the
table above can also be used to specify the registers, for instance
<strong>–tpm2-public-key-pcrs=boot-loader-code+system-identity</strong>.</p>
<p>
The <strong>–tpm2-signature=</strong> option takes a path to a TPM2 PCR signature file
as generated by the *systemd-measure*(1) tool. If this is not specified
explicitly, a suitable signature file tpm2-pcr-signature.json is
searched for in <em>etc/systemd</em>, <em>run/systemd</em>, <em>usr/lib/systemd</em> (in this
order) and used. If a signature file is specified or found it is used to
verify if the volume can be unlocked with it given the current PCR
state, before the new slot is written to disk. This is intended as
safety net to ensure that access to a volume is not lost if a public key
is enrolled for which no valid signature for the current PCR state is
available. If the supplied signature does not unlock the current PCR
state and public key combination, no slot is enrolled and the operation
will fail. If no signature file is specified or found no such safety
verification is done.</p>

*–tpm2-pcrlock=*/PATH/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures a TPM2 pcrlock policy to bind encryption to. Expects a path
to a pcrlock policy file as generated by the *systemd-pcrlock*(1) tool.
If a TPM2 device is enrolled and this option is not used but a file
pcrlock.json is found in <em>run/systemd</em> or <em>var/lib/systemd</em> it is
automatically used. Assign an empty string to turn this behaviour off.</p>
<p>
Added in version 255.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–wipe-slot=*/SLOT[,SLOT…]/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wipes one or more LUKS2 key slots. Takes a comma separated list of
numeric slot indexes, or the special strings &#34;all&#34; (for wiping all key
slots), &#34;empty&#34; (for wiping all key slots that are unlocked by an empty
passphrase), &#34;password&#34; (for wiping all key slots that are unlocked by a
traditional passphrase), &#34;recovery&#34; (for wiping all key slots that are
unlocked by a recovery key), &#34;pkcs11&#34; (for wiping all key slots that are
unlocked by a PKCS#11 token), &#34;fido2&#34; (for wiping all key slots that are
unlocked by a FIDO2 token), &#34;tpm2&#34; (for wiping all key slots that are
unlocked by a TPM2 chip), or any combination of these strings or numeric
indexes, in which case all slots matching either are wiped. As safety
precaution an operation that wipes all slots without exception (so that
the volume cannot be unlocked at all anymore, unless the volume key is
known) is refused.</p>
<p>
This switch may be used alone, in which case only the requested wipe
operation is executed. It may also be used in combination with any of
the enrollment options listed above, in which case the enrollment is
completed first, and only when successful the wipe operation executed
— and the newly added slot is always excluded from the wiping.
Combining enrollment and slot wiping may thus be used to update existing
enrollments:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
systemd-cryptenroll /dev/sda1 --wipe-slot=tpm2 --tpm2-device=auto
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The above command will enroll the TPM2 chip, and then wipe all
previously created TPM2 enrollments on the LUKS2 volume, leaving only
the newly created one. Combining wiping and enrollment may also be used
to replace enrollments of different types, for example for changing from
a PKCS#11 enrollment to a FIDO2 one:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
systemd-cryptenroll /dev/sda1 --wipe-slot=pkcs11 --fido2-device=auto
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Or for replacing an enrolled empty password by TPM2:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
systemd-cryptenroll /dev/sda1 --wipe-slot=empty --tpm2-device=auto
</pre>
