DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>ssh-keygen</strong> generates, manages and converts authentication keys for
<strong>ssh*(1). *ssh-keygen</strong> can create keys for use by SSH protocol
version 2.</p>
<p>
The type of key to be generated is specified with the <strong>-t</strong> option. If
invoked without any arguments, <strong>ssh-keygen</strong> will generate an Ed25519
key.</p>
<p>
<strong>ssh-keygen</strong> is also used to generate groups for use in Diffie-Hellman
group exchange (DH-GEX). See the <strong>MODULI GENERATION</strong> section for
details.</p>
<p>
Finally, <strong>ssh-keygen</strong> can be used to generate and update Key Revocation
Lists, and to test whether given keys have been revoked by one. See the
<strong>KEY REVOCATION LISTS</strong> section for details.</p>
<p>
Normally each user wishing to use SSH with public key authentication
runs this once to create the authentication key in <em>~</em>.ssh/id_ecdsa/,
<em>~</em>.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk/, <em>~</em>.ssh/id_ed25519/, <em>~</em>.ssh/id_ed25519_sk/ or
<em>~</em>.ssh/id_rsa/. Additionally, the system administrator may use this to
generate host keys, as seen in <em>/etc/rc</em>.</p>
<p>
Normally this program generates the key and asks for a file in which to
store the private key. The public key is stored in a file with the same
name but ``.pub&#39;&#39; appended. The program also asks for a passphrase. The
passphrase may be empty to indicate no passphrase (host keys must have
an empty passphrase), or it may be a string of arbitrary length. A
passphrase is similar to a password, except it can be a phrase with a
series of words, punctuation, numbers, whitespace, or any string of
characters you want. Good passphrases are 10-30 characters long, are not
simple sentences or otherwise easily guessable (English prose has only
1-2 bits of entropy per character, and provides very bad passphrases),
and contain a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and
non-alphanumeric characters. The passphrase can be changed later by
using the <strong>-p</strong> option.</p>
<p>
There is no way to recover a lost passphrase. If the passphrase is lost
or forgotten, a new key must be generated and the corresponding public
key copied to other machines.</p>
<p>
<strong>ssh-keygen</strong> will by default write keys in an OpenSSH-specific format.
This format is preferred as it offers better protection for keys at rest
as well as allowing storage of key comments within the private key file
itself. The key comment may be useful to help identify the key. The
comment is initialized to ``user@host&#39;&#39; when the key is created, but can
be changed using the <strong>-c</strong> option.</p>
<p>
It is still possible for <strong>ssh-keygen</strong> to write the previously-used PEM
format private keys using the <strong>-m</strong> flag. This may be used when
generating new keys, and existing new-format keys may be converted using
this option in conjunction with the <strong>-p</strong> (change passphrase) flag.</p>
<p>
After a key is generated, <strong>ssh-keygen</strong> will ask where the keys should be
placed to be activated.</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-A</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Generate host keys of all default key types (rsa, ecdsa, and
ed25519) if they do not already exist. The host keys are generated
with the default key file path, an empty passphrase, default bits for
the key type, and default comment. If <strong>-f</strong> has also been specified,
its argument is used as a prefix to the default path for the resulting
host key files. This is used by <em>/etc/rc</em> to generate new host keys.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-a</strong> <em>rounds</em>
</dt>
<dd>When saving a private key, this option specifies the
number of KDF (key derivation function, currently *bcrypt_pbkdf*(3))
rounds used. Higher numbers result in slower passphrase verification
and increased resistance to brute-force password cracking (should the
keys be stolen). The default is 16 rounds.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-B</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Show the bubblebabble digest of specified private or public
key file.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-b</strong> <em>bits</em>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the number of bits in the key to create. For
RSA keys, the minimum size is 1024 bits and the default is 3072 bits.
Generally, 3072 bits is considered sufficient. For ECDSA keys, the
<strong>-b</strong> flag determines the key length by selecting from one of three
elliptic curve sizes: 256, 384 or 521 bits. Attempting to use bit
lengths other than these three values for ECDSA keys will fail.
ECDSA-SK, Ed25519 and Ed25519-SK keys have a fixed length and the <strong>-b</strong>
flag will be ignored.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-C</strong> <em>comment</em>
</dt>
<dd>Provides a new comment.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-c</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Requests changing the comment in the private and public key
files. The program will prompt for the file containing the private
keys, for the passphrase if the key has one, and for the new comment.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-D</strong> <em>pkcs11</em>
</dt>
<dd>Download the public keys provided by the PKCS#11
shared library <em>pkcs11</em>. When used in combination with <strong>-s</strong>, this
option indicates that a CA key resides in a PKCS#11 token (see the
<strong>CERTIFICATES</strong> section for details).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-E</strong> <em>fingerprint_hash</em>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the hash algorithm used when
displaying key fingerprints. Valid options are: ``md5&#39;&#39; and
``sha256&#39;&#39;. The default is ``sha256&#39;&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-e</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option will read a private or public OpenSSH key file and
print to stdout a public key in one of the formats specified by the
<strong>-m</strong> option. The default export format is ``RFC4716&#39;&#39;. This option
allows exporting OpenSSH keys for use by other programs, including
several commercial SSH implementations.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-F</strong> <em>hostname</em> | <em>[hostname]:port</em>
</dt>
<dd>Search for the specified
<em>hostname</em> (with optional port number) in a <em>known_hosts</em> file,
listing any occurrences found. This option is useful to find hashed
host names or addresses and may also be used in conjunction with the
<strong>-H</strong> option to print found keys in a hashed format.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-f</strong> <em>filename</em>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the filename of the key file.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-g</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use generic DNS format when printing fingerprint resource
records using the <strong>-r</strong> command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-H</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Hash a <em>known_hosts</em> file. This replaces all hostnames and
addresses with hashed representations within the specified file; the
original content is moved to a file with a .old suffix. These hashes
may be used normally by <strong>ssh</strong> and <strong>sshd</strong>, but they do not reveal
identifying information should the file&#39;s contents be disclosed. This
option will not modify existing hashed hostnames and is therefore safe
to use on files that mix hashed and non-hashed names.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-h</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When signing a key, create a host certificate instead of a
user certificate. See the <strong>CERTIFICATES</strong> section for details.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-I</strong> <em>certificate_identity</em>
</dt>
<dd>Specify the key identity when signing a
public key. See the <strong>CERTIFICATES</strong> section for details.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-i</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option will read an unencrypted private (or public) key
file in the format specified by the <strong>-m</strong> option and print an OpenSSH
compatible private (or public) key to stdout. This option allows
importing keys from other software, including several commercial SSH
implementations. The default import format is ``RFC4716&#39;&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-K</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Download resident keys from a FIDO authenticator. Public and
private key files will be written to the current directory for each
downloaded key. If multiple FIDO authenticators are attached, keys
will be downloaded from the first touched authenticator. See the <strong>FIDO
AUTHENTICATOR</strong> section for more information.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-k</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Generate a KRL file. In this mode, <strong>ssh-keygen</strong> will generate
a KRL file at the location specified via the <strong>-f</strong> flag that revokes
every key or certificate presented on the command line.
Keys/certificates to be revoked may be specified by public key file or
using the format described in the <strong>KEY REVOCATION LISTS</strong> section.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-L</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Prints the contents of one or more certificates.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-l</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Show fingerprint of specified public key file. <strong>ssh-keygen</strong>
will try to find the matching public key file and prints its
fingerprint. If combined with <strong>-v</strong>, a visual ASCII art representation
of the key is supplied with the fingerprint.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-M</strong> <strong>generate</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Generate candidate Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange
(DH-GEX) parameters for eventual use by the
`diffie-hellman-group-exchange-*&#39; key exchange methods. The numbers
generated by this operation must be further screened before use. See
the <strong>MODULI GENERATION</strong> section for more information.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-M</strong> <strong>screen</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Screen candidate parameters for Diffie-Hellman Group
Exchange. This will accept a list of candidate numbers and test that
they are safe (Sophie Germain) primes with acceptable group
generators. The results of this operation may be added to the
<em>/etc/ssh/moduli</em> file. See the <strong>MODULI GENERATION</strong> section for more
information.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-m</strong> <em>key_format</em>
</dt>
<dd>Specify a key format for key generation, the <strong>-i</strong>
(import), <strong>-e</strong> (export) conversion options, and the <strong>-p</strong> change
passphrase operation. The latter may be used to convert between
OpenSSH private key and PEM private key formats. The supported key
formats are: ``RFC4716&#39;&#39; (RFC 4716/SSH2 public or private key),
``PKCS8&#39;&#39; (PKCS8 public or private key) or ``PEM&#39;&#39; (PEM public key).
By default OpenSSH will write newly-generated private keys in its own
format, but when converting public keys for export the default format
is ``RFC4716&#39;&#39;. Setting a format of ``PEM&#39;&#39; when generating or
updating a supported private key type will cause the key to be stored
in the legacy PEM private key format.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-N</strong> <em>new_passphrase</em>
</dt>
<dd>Provides the new passphrase.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-n</strong> <em>principals</em>
</dt>
<dd>Specify one or more principals (user or host
names) to be included in a certificate when signing a key. Multiple
principals may be specified, separated by commas. See the
<strong>CERTIFICATES</strong> section for details.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-O</strong> <em>option</em>
</dt>
<dd>Specify a key/value option. These are specific to the
operation that <strong>ssh-keygen</strong> has been requested to perform.

When signing certificates, one of the options listed in the
<strong>CERTIFICATES</strong> section may be specified here.

When performing moduli generation or screening, one of the options
listed in the <strong>MODULI GENERATION</strong> section may be specified.

When generating FIDO authenticator-backed keys, the options listed in
the <strong>FIDO AUTHENTICATOR</strong> section may be specified.

When performing signature-related options using the <strong>-Y</strong> flag, the
following options are accepted:</dd>
<dt>
*hashalg*=/algorithm/
</dt>
<dd>Selects the hash algorithm to use for hashing
the message to be signed. Valid algorithms are ``sha256&#39;&#39; and
``sha512.&#39;&#39; The default is ``sha512.&#39;&#39;</dd>
<dt>
<strong>print-pubkey</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print the full public key to standard output after
signature verification.</dd>
<dt>
*verify-time*=/timestamp/
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a time to use when validating
signatures instead of the current time. The time may be specified as a
date or time in the YYYYMMDD[Z] or in YYYYMMDDHHMM[SS][Z] formats.
Dates and times will be interpreted in the current system time zone
unless suffixed with a Z character, which causes them to be
interpreted in the UTC time zone.

When generating SSHFP DNS records from public keys using the <strong>-r</strong>
flag, the following options are accepted:</dd>
<dt>
*hashalg*=/algorithm/
</dt>
<dd>Selects a hash algorithm to use when printing
SSHFP records using the <strong>-D</strong> flag. Valid algorithms are ``sha1&#39;&#39; and
``sha256&#39;&#39;. The default is to print both.

The <strong>-O</strong> option may be specified multiple times.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-P</strong> <em>passphrase</em>
</dt>
<dd>Provides the (old) passphrase.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-p</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Requests changing the passphrase of a private key file instead
of creating a new private key. The program will prompt for the file
containing the private key, for the old passphrase, and twice for the
new passphrase.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-Q</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Test whether keys have been revoked in a KRL. If the <strong>-l</strong>
option is also specified then the contents of the KRL will be printed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-q</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Silence <strong>ssh-keygen</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-R</strong> <em>hostname</em> | <em>[hostname]:port</em>
</dt>
<dd>Removes all keys belonging to
the specified <em>hostname</em> (with optional port number) from a
<em>known_hosts</em> file. This option is useful to delete hashed hosts (see
the <strong>-H</strong> option above).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-r</strong> <em>hostname</em>
</dt>
<dd>Print the SSHFP fingerprint resource record named
<em>hostname</em> for the specified public key file.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-s</strong> <em>ca_key</em>
</dt>
<dd>Certify (sign) a public key using the specified CA
key. See the <strong>CERTIFICATES</strong> section for details.

When generating a KRL, <strong>-s</strong> specifies a path to a CA public key file
used to revoke certificates directly by key ID or serial number. See
the <strong>KEY REVOCATION LISTS</strong> section for details.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-t</strong> <strong>ecdsa</strong> | ecdsa-sk | ed25519 | ed25519-sk | rsa
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the
type of key to create. The possible values are ``ecdsa&#39;&#39;,
``ecdsa-sk&#39;&#39;, ``ed25519&#39;&#39;, ``ed25519-sk&#39;&#39;, or ``rsa&#39;&#39;.

This flag may also be used to specify the desired signature type when
signing certificates using an RSA CA key. The available RSA signature
variants are ``ssh-rsa&#39;&#39; (SHA1 signatures, not recommended),
``rsa-sha2-256&#39;&#39;, and ``rsa-sha2-512&#39;&#39; (the default).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-U</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When used in combination with <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-Y</strong> <strong>sign</strong>, this option
indicates that a CA key resides in a <strong>ssh-agent*(1). See the
*CERTIFICATES</strong> section for more information.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-u</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Update a KRL. When specified with <strong>-k</strong>, keys listed via the
command line are added to the existing KRL rather than a new KRL being
created.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-V</strong> <em>validity_interval</em>
</dt>
<dd>Specify a validity interval when signing a
certificate. A validity interval may consist of a single time,
indicating that the certificate is valid beginning now and expiring at
that time, or may consist of two times separated by a colon to
indicate an explicit time interval.

The start time may be specified as:</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd>The string ``always&#39;&#39; to indicate the certificate has no specified
start time.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd>A date or time in the system time zone formatted as YYYYMMDD or
YYYYMMDDHHMM[SS].</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd>A date or time in the UTC time zone as YYYYMMDDZ or YYYYMMDDHHMM[SS]Z.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd>A relative time before the current system time consisting of a minus
sign followed by an interval in the format described in the TIME
FORMATS section of *sshd_config*(5).</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd>A raw seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 00:00:00 UTC) as a hexadecimal
number beginning with ``0x&#39;&#39;.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The end time may be specified similarly to the start time:</p>
<ul>
<li>The string ``forever&#39;&#39; to indicate the certificate has no specified
end time.</li>
<li>A date or time in the system time zone formatted as YYYYMMDD or
YYYYMMDDHHMM[SS].</li>
<li>A date or time in the UTC time zone as YYYYMMDDZ or YYYYMMDDHHMM[SS]Z.</li>
<li>A relative time after the current system time consisting of a plus
sign followed by an interval in the format described in the TIME
FORMATS section of *sshd_config*(5).</li>
<li>A raw seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 00:00:00 UTC) as a hexadecimal
number beginning with ``0x&#39;&#39;.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
+52w1d
</dt>
<dd>Valid from now to 52 weeks and one day from now.</dd>
<dt>
-4w:+4w
</dt>
<dd>Valid from four weeks ago to four weeks from now.</dd>
<dt>
20100101123000:20110101123000
</dt>
<dd>Valid from 12:30 PM, January 1st,
2010 to 12:30 PM, January 1st, 2011.</dd>
<dt>
20100101123000Z:20110101123000Z
</dt>
<dd>Similar, but interpreted in the UTC
time zone rather than the system time zone.</dd>
<dt>
-1d:20110101
</dt>
<dd>Valid from yesterday to midnight, January 1st, 2011.</dd>
<dt>
0x1:0x2000000000
</dt>
<dd>Valid from roughly early 1970 to May 2033.</dd>
<dt>
-1m:forever
</dt>
<dd>Valid from one minute ago and never expiring.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-v</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Verbose mode. Causes <strong>ssh-keygen</strong> to print debugging messages
about its progress. This is helpful for debugging moduli generation.
Multiple <strong>-v</strong> options increase the verbosity. The maximum is 3.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-w</strong> <em>provider</em>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a path to a library that will be used
when creating FIDO authenticator-hosted keys, overriding the default
of using the internal USB HID support.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-Y</strong> <strong>find-principals</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Find the principal(s) associated with the
public key of a signature, provided using the <strong>-s</strong> flag in an
authorized signers file provided using the <strong>-f</strong> flag. The format of
the allowed signers file is documented in the <strong>ALLOWED SIGNERS</strong>
section below. If one or more matching principals are found, they are
returned on standard output.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-Y</strong> <strong>match-principals</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Find principal matching the principal name
provided using the <strong>-I</strong> flag in the authorized signers file specified
using the <strong>-f</strong> flag. If one or more matching principals are found,
they are returned on standard output.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-Y</strong> <strong>check-novalidate</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Checks that a signature generated using
<strong>ssh-keygen</strong> <strong>-Y</strong> <strong>sign</strong> has a valid structure. This does not validate
if a signature comes from an authorized signer. When testing a
signature, <strong>ssh-keygen</strong> accepts a message on standard input and a
signature namespace using <strong>-n</strong>. A file containing the corresponding
signature must also be supplied using the <strong>-s</strong> flag. Successful
testing of the signature is signalled by <strong>ssh-keygen</strong> returning a zero
exit status.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-Y</strong> <strong>sign</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Cryptographically sign a file or some data using an SSH
key. When signing, <strong>ssh-keygen</strong> accepts zero or more files to sign on
the command-line - if no files are specified then <strong>ssh-keygen</strong> will
sign data presented on standard input. Signatures are written to the
path of the input file with ``.sig&#39;&#39; appended, or to standard output
if the message to be signed was read from standard input.

The key used for signing is specified using the <strong>-f</strong> option and may
refer to either a private key, or a public key with the private half
available via *ssh-agent*(1). An additional signature namespace, used
to prevent signature confusion across different domains of use (e.g.
file signing vs email signing) must be provided via the <strong>-n</strong> flag.
Namespaces are arbitrary strings, and may include: ``file&#39;&#39; for file
signing, ``email&#39;&#39; for email signing. For custom uses, it is
recommended to use names following a NAMESPACE@YOUR.DOMAIN pattern to
generate unambiguous namespaces.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-Y</strong> <strong>verify</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Request to verify a signature generated using
<strong>ssh-keygen</strong> <strong>-Y</strong> <strong>sign</strong> as described above. When verifying a
signature, <strong>ssh-keygen</strong> accepts a message on standard input and a
signature namespace using <strong>-n</strong>. A file containing the corresponding
signature must also be supplied using the <strong>-s</strong> flag, along with the
identity of the signer using <strong>-I</strong> and a list of allowed signers via
the <strong>-f</strong> flag. The format of the allowed signers file is documented in
the <strong>ALLOWED SIGNERS</strong> section below. A file containing revoked keys
can be passed using the <strong>-r</strong> flag. The revocation file may be a KRL or
a one-per-line list of public keys. Successful verification by an
authorized signer is signalled by <strong>ssh-keygen</strong> returning a zero exit
status.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-y</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option will read a private OpenSSH format file and print
an OpenSSH public key to stdout.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-Z</strong> <em>cipher</em>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the cipher to use for encryption when
writing an OpenSSH-format private key file. The list of available
ciphers may be obtained using Qq ssh -Q cipher . The default is
``aes256-ctr&#39;&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-z</strong> <em>serial_number</em>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a serial number to be embedded in
the certificate to distinguish this certificate from others from the
same CA. If the <em>serial_number</em> is prefixed with a `+&#39; character, then
the serial number will be incremented for each certificate signed on a
single command-line. The default serial number is zero.

When generating a KRL, the <strong>-z</strong> flag is used to specify a KRL version
number.</dd>

MODULI GENERATION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>ssh-keygen</strong> may be used to generate groups for the Diffie-Hellman Group
Exchange (DH-GEX) protocol. Generating these groups is a two-step
process: first, candidate primes are generated using a fast, but memory
intensive process. These candidate primes are then tested for
suitability (a CPU-intensive process).</p>
<p>
Generation of primes is performed using the <strong>-M</strong> <strong>generate</strong> option. The
desired length of the primes may be specified by the <strong>-O</strong> <strong>bits</strong> option.
For example:</p>
<p>
Dl # ssh-keygen -M generate -O bits=2048 moduli-2048.candidates</p>
<p>
By default, the search for primes begins at a random point in the
desired length range. This may be overridden using the <strong>-O</strong> <strong>start</strong>
option, which specifies a different start point (in hex).</p>
<p>
Once a set of candidates have been generated, they must be screened for
suitability. This may be performed using the <strong>-M</strong> <strong>screen</strong> option. In
this mode <strong>ssh-keygen</strong> will read candidates from standard input (or a
file specified using the <strong>-f</strong> option). For example:</p>
<p>
Dl # ssh-keygen -M screen -f moduli-2048.candidates moduli-2048</p>
<p>
By default, each candidate will be subjected to 100 primality tests.
This may be overridden using the <strong>-O</strong> <strong>prime-tests</strong> option. The DH
generator value will be chosen automatically for the prime under
consideration. If a specific generator is desired, it may be requested
using the <strong>-O</strong> <strong>generator</strong> option. Valid generator values are 2, 3,
and 5.</p>
<p>
Screened DH groups may be installed in <em>/etc/ssh/moduli</em>. It is
important that this file contains moduli of a range of bit lengths.</p>
<p>
A number of options are available for moduli generation and screening
via the <strong>-O</strong> flag:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
*lines Ns = Ns */number/
</dt>
<dd>Exit after screening the specified number
of lines while performing DH candidate screening.</dd>
<dt>
*start-line Ns = Ns */line-number/
</dt>
<dd>Start screening at the specified
line number while performing DH candidate screening.</dd>
<dt>
*checkpoint Ns = Ns */filename/
</dt>
<dd>Write the last line processed to
the specified file while performing DH candidate screening. This will
be used to skip lines in the input file that have already been
processed if the job is restarted.</dd>
<dt>
*memory Ns = Ns */mbytes/
</dt>
<dd>Specify the amount of memory to use (in
megabytes) when generating candidate moduli for DH-GEX.</dd>

CERTIFICATES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>ssh-keygen</strong> supports signing of keys to produce certificates that may
be used for user or host authentication. Certificates consist of a
public key, some identity information, zero or more principal (user or
host) names and a set of options that are signed by a Certification
Authority (CA) key. Clients or servers may then trust only the CA key
and verify its signature on a certificate rather than trusting many
user/host keys. Note that OpenSSH certificates are a different, and much
simpler, format to the X.509 certificates used in *ssl*/(8)./</p>
<p>
<strong>ssh-keygen</strong> supports two types of certificates: user and host. User
certificates authenticate users to servers, whereas host certificates
authenticate server hosts to users. To generate a user certificate:</p>
<p>
Dl $ ssh-keygen -s /path/to/ca_key -I key_id /path/to/user_key.pub</p>
<p>
The resultant certificate will be placed in
<em>/path/to/user_key-cert.pub.</em> A host certificate requires the <strong>-h</strong>
option:</p>
<p>
Dl $ ssh-keygen -s /path/to/ca_key -I key_id -h /path/to/host_key.pub</p>
<p>
The host certificate will be output to <em>/path/to/host_key-cert.pub.</em></p>
<p>
It is possible to sign using a CA key stored in a PKCS#11 token by
providing the token library using <strong>-D</strong> and identifying the CA key by
providing its public half as an argument to *-s*/ :/</p>
<p>
Dl $ ssh-keygen -s ca_key.pub -D libpkcs11.so -I key_id user_key.pub</p>
<p>
Similarly, it is possible for the CA key to be hosted in a
<strong>ssh-agent*/(1)./ This is indicated by the *-U</strong> flag and, again, the CA
key must be identified by its public half.</p>
<p>
Dl $ ssh-keygen -Us ca_key.pub -I key_id user_key.pub</p>
<p>
In all cases, <em>key_id</em> is a &#34;key identifier&#34; that is logged by the
server when the certificate is used for authentication.</p>
<p>
Certificates may be limited to be valid for a set of principal
(user/host) names. By default, generated certificates are valid for all
users or hosts. To generate a certificate for a specified set of
principals:</p>
<p>
Dl $ ssh-keygen -s ca_key -I key_id -n user1,user2 user_key.pub Dl &#34;$
ssh-keygen -s ca_key -I key_id -h -n host.domain host_key.pub&#34;</p>
<p>
Additional limitations on the validity and use of user certificates may
be specified through certificate options. A certificate option may
disable features of the SSH session, may be valid only when presented
from particular source addresses or may force the use of a specific
command.</p>
<p>
The options that are valid for user certificates are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>clear</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Clear all enabled permissions. This is useful for clearing
the default set of permissions so permissions may be added
individually.</dd>
<dt>

</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><strong>extension : Ns
 */name/</strong> Ns [Ns = Ns */contents]/ :: Includes an arbitrary

 should include a domain suffix, e.g. ``name@example.com&#39;&#39;. If
 <em>contents</em> is specified then it is included as the contents of the
 extension/option encoded as a string, otherwise the extension/option
 is created with no contents (usually indicating a flag). Extensions
 may be ignored by a client or server that does not recognise them,
 whereas unknown critical options will cause the certificate to be
 refused.</li>
</ul>

other methods may be supported in the future.

At present, no standard options are valid for host keys.

Finally, certificates may be defined with a validity lifetime. The
<strong>-V</strong> option allows specification of certificate start and end times. A
certificate that is presented at a time outside this range will not be
considered valid. By default, certificates are valid from the UNIX
Epoch to the distant future.

For certificates to be used for user or host authentication, the CA
public key must be trusted by *sshd*/(8)/ or *ssh*/(1)./ Refer to
those manual pages for details.</dd>

FIDO AUTHENTICATOR
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>ssh-keygen</strong> is able to generate FIDO authenticator-backed keys, after
which they may be used much like any other key type supported by
OpenSSH, so long as the hardware authenticator is attached when the keys
are used. FIDO authenticators generally require the user to explicitly
authorise operations by touching or tapping them. FIDO keys consist of
two parts: a key handle part stored in the private key file on disk, and
a per-device private key that is unique to each FIDO authenticator and
that cannot be exported from the authenticator hardware. These are
combined by the hardware at authentication time to derive the real key
that is used to sign authentication challenges. Supported key types are
<strong>ecdsa-sk</strong> and *ed25519-sk*/./</p>
<p>
The options that are valid for FIDO keys are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>application</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Override the default FIDO application/origin string
of ``ssh:&#39;&#39;. This may be useful when generating host or
domain-specific resident keys. The specified application string must
begin with ``ssh:&#39;&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
*challenge*/=path/
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a path to a challenge string that will
be passed to the FIDO authenticator during key generation. The
challenge string may be used as part of an out-of-band protocol for
key enrollment (a random challenge is used by default).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>device</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Explicitly specify a *fido*/(4)/ device to use, rather
than letting the authenticator middleware select one.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>no-touch-required</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Indicate that the generated private key should
not require touch events (user presence) when making signatures. Note
that *sshd*/(8)/ will refuse such signatures by default, unless
overridden via an authorized_keys option.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>resident</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Indicate that the key handle should be stored on the
FIDO authenticator itself. This makes it easier to use the
authenticator on multiple computers. Resident keys may be supported on
FIDO2 authenticators and typically require that a PIN be set on the
authenticator prior to generation. Resident keys may be loaded off the
authenticator using *ssh-add*/(1)./ Storing both parts of a key on a
FIDO authenticator increases the likelihood of an attacker being able
to use a stolen authenticator device.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>user</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A username to be associated with a resident key, overriding
the empty default username. Specifying a username may be useful when
generating multiple resident keys for the same application name.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>verify-required</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Indicate that this private key should require
user verification for each signature. Not all FIDO authenticators
support this option. Currently PIN authentication is the only
supported verification method, but other methods may be supported in
the future.</dd>
<dt>
*write-attestation*/=path/

KEY REVOCATION LISTS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>ssh-keygen</strong> is able to manage OpenSSH format Key Revocation Lists
(KRLs). These binary files specify keys or certificates to be revoked
using a compact format, taking as little as one bit per certificate if
they are being revoked by serial number.</p>
<p>
KRLs may be generated using the <strong>-k</strong> flag. This option reads one or more
files from the command line and generates a new KRL. The files may
either contain a KRL specification (see below) or public keys, listed
one per line. Plain public keys are revoked by listing their hash or
contents in the KRL and certificates revoked by serial number or key ID
(if the serial is zero or not available).</p>
<p>
Revoking keys using a KRL specification offers explicit control over the
types of record used to revoke keys and may be used to directly revoke
certificates by serial number or key ID without having the complete
original certificate on hand. A KRL specification consists of lines
containing one of the following directives followed by a colon and some
directive-specific information.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
*serial*/: serial_number[-serial_number]/
</dt>
<dd>Revokes a certificate
with the specified serial number. Serial numbers are 64-bit values,
not including zero and may be expressed in decimal, hex or octal. If
two serial numbers are specified separated by a hyphen, then the range
of serial numbers including and between each is revoked. The CA key
must have been specified on the <strong>ssh-keygen</strong> command line using the
<strong>-s</strong> option.</dd>
<dt>
*id*/: key_id/
</dt>
<dd>Revokes a certificate with the specified key ID
string. The CA key must have been specified on the <strong>ssh-keygen</strong>
command line using the <strong>-s</strong> option.</dd>
<dt>
*key*/: public_key/
</dt>
<dd>Revokes the specified key. If a certificate is
listed, then it is revoked as a plain public key.</dd>
<dt>
*sha1*/: public_key/
</dt>
<dd>Revokes the specified key by including its
SHA1 hash in the KRL.</dd>
<dt>
*sha256*/: public_key/
</dt>
<dd>Revokes the specified key by including its
SHA256 hash in the KRL. KRLs that revoke keys by SHA256 hash are not
supported by OpenSSH versions prior to 7.9.</dd>
<dt>
*hash*/: fingerprint/
</dt>
<dd>Revokes a key using a fingerprint hash, as
obtained from a <strong>sshd*/(8)/ authentication log message or the
*ssh-keygen</strong> <strong>-l</strong> flag. Only SHA256 fingerprints are supported here
and resultant KRLs are not supported by OpenSSH versions prior to 7.9.

KRLs may be updated using the <strong>-u</strong> flag in addition to *-k*/./ When
this option is specified, keys listed via the command line are merged
into the KRL, adding to those already there.

It is also possible, given a KRL, to test whether it revokes a
particular key (or keys). The <strong>-Q</strong> flag will query an existing KRL,
testing each key specified on the command line. If any key listed on
the command line has been revoked (or an error encountered) then
<strong>ssh-keygen</strong> will exit with a non-zero exit status. A zero exit status
will only be returned if no key was revoked.</dd>

ALLOWED SIGNERS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When verifying signatures, <strong>ssh-keygen</strong> uses a simple list of identities
and keys to determine whether a signature comes from an authorized
source. This &#34;allowed signers&#34; file uses a format patterned after the
AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT described in *sshd*/(8)./ Each line of the
file contains the following space-separated fields: principals, options,
keytype, base64-encoded key. Empty lines and lines starting with a `#&#39;
are ignored as comments.</p>
<p>
The principals field is a pattern-list (see PATTERNS in
*ssh_config*/(5))/ consisting of one or more comma-separated USER@DOMAIN
identity patterns that are accepted for signing. When verifying, the
identity presented via the <strong>-I</strong> option must match a principals pattern
in order for the corresponding key to be considered acceptable for
verification.</p>
<p>
The options (if present) consist of comma-separated option
specifications. No spaces are permitted, except within double quotes.
The following option specifications are supported (note that option
keywords are case-insensitive):</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>cert-authority</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Indicates that this key is accepted as a
certificate authority (CA) and that certificates signed by this CA may
be accepted for verification.</dd>
<dt>
*namespaces*/=&#34;namespace-list&#34;/
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a pattern-list of
namespaces that are accepted for this key. If this option is present,
the signature namespace embedded in the signature object and presented
on the verification command-line must match the specified list before
the key will be considered acceptable.</dd>
<dt>
*valid-after*/=&#34;timestamp&#34;/
</dt>
<dd>Indicates that the key is valid for use
at or after the specified timestamp, which may be a date or time in
the YYYYMMDD[Z] or YYYYMMDDHHMM[SS][Z] formats. Dates and times will
be interpreted in the current system time zone unless suffixed with a
Z character, which causes them to be interpreted in the UTC time zone.</dd>
<dt>
*valid-before*/=&#34;timestamp&#34;/
</dt>
<dd>Indicates that the key is valid for
use at or before the specified timestamp.

When verifying signatures made by certificates, the expected principal
name must match both the principals pattern in the allowed signers
file and the principals embedded in the certificate itself.

An example allowed signers file:

​# Comments allowed at start of line<br>
user1@example.com,user2@example.com ssh-rsa AAAAX1…<br>
​# A certificate authority, trusted for all principals in a domain.<br>
