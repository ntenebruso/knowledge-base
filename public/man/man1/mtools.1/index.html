Introduction
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Mtools is a collection of tools to allow Unix systems to manipulate
MS-DOS files: read, write, and move around files on an MS-DOS file
system (typically a floppy disk). Where reasonable, each program
attempts to emulate the MS-DOS equivalent command. However, unnecessary
restrictions and oddities of DOS are not emulated. For instance, it is
possible to move subdirectories from one subdirectory to another.</p>
<p>
Mtools is sufficient to give access to MS-DOS file systems. For
instance, commands such as <code class="verbatim">mdir a:</code> work on the <code class="verbatim">a:</code> floppy without any
preliminary mounting or initialization (assuming the default
<code class="verbatim">∞/nix/store/4v5wsg9mhxhkb8kh4yd94zxzchaxp9a9-mtools-4.0.45/etc/mtools.conf∫</code>
works on your machine). With mtools, one can change floppies too without
unmounting and mounting.</p>

Where to get mtools
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Mtools can be found at the following places (and their mirrors):</p>
<pre class="example">
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mtools/mtools-4.0.45.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>
These patches are named <code class="verbatim">mtools-=/version/</code>-<code class="verbatim">/ddmm/</code>.taz=, where version
stands for the base version, <em>dd</em> for the day and <em>mm</em> for the month.
Due to a lack of space, I usually leave only the most recent patch.</p>
<p>
There is an mtools mailing list at info-mtools @ gnu.org . Please send
all bug reports to this list. You may subscribe to the list at
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/info-mtools.">https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/info-mtools.</a> (N.B. Please remove
the spaces around the &#34;@&#34;. I left them there in order to fool spambots.)
Announcements of new mtools versions will also be sent to the list, in
addition to the Linux announce newsgroups. The mailing list is archived
at <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/pipermail/info-mtools/">http://lists.gnu.org/pipermail/info-mtools/</a></p>

<h3 id="headline-5">
Options and filenames
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>MS-DOS filenames are composed of a drive letter followed by a colon, a
subdirectory, and a filename. Only the filename part is mandatory, the
drive letter and the subdirectory are optional. Filenames without a
drive letter refer to Unix files. Subdirectory names can use either the
&#39;<code class="verbatim">/</code>&#39; or &#39;<code class="verbatim">\</code>&#39; separator. The use of the &#39;<code class="verbatim">\</code>&#39; separator or wildcards
requires the names to be enclosed in quotes to protect them from the
shell. However, wildcards in Unix filenames should not be enclosed in
quotes, because here we <strong>want</strong> the shell to expand them.</p>
<p>
The regular expression &#34;pattern matching&#34; routines follow the Unix-style
rules. For example, `=*=&#39; matches all MS-DOS files in lieu of `=*.*=&#39;.
The archive, hidden, read-only and system attribute bits are ignored
during pattern matching.</p>
<p>
All options use the <code class="verbatim">-</code> (minus) as their first character, not <code class="verbatim">/</code> as
you&#39;d expect in MS-DOS.</p>
<p>
Most mtools commands allow multiple filename parameters, which doesn&#39;t
follow MS-DOS conventions, but which is more user-friendly.</p>
<p>
Most mtools commands allow options that instruct them how to handle file
name clashes. See section name clashes, for more details on these.</p>
<p>
All commands accept the <code class="verbatim">-i</code> flag which allows to specify an image file
(See section drive letters).</p>
<p>
All commands accept the <code class="verbatim">-V</code> flag which prints the version, and most
accept the <code class="verbatim">-v</code> flag, which switches on verbose mode. In verbose mode,
these commands print out the name of the MS-DOS files upon which they
act, unless stated otherwise. See section Commands, for a description of
the options which are specific to each command.</p>

<h3 id="headline-6">
Drive letters
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The meaning of the drive letters depends on the target architectures.
However, on most target architectures, drive A is the first floppy
drive, drive B is the second floppy drive (if available), drive J is a
Jaz drive (if available), and drive Z is a Zip drive (if available). On
those systems where the device name is derived from the SCSI id, the Jaz
drive is assumed to be at SCSI target 4, and the Zip at SCSI target 5
(factory default settings). On Linux, both drives are assumed to be the
second drive on the SCSI bus (/dev/sdb). The default settings can be
changes using a configuration file (see section Configuration).</p>
<p>
The drive letter : (colon) has a special meaning. It is used to access
image files which are directly specified on the command line using the
<code class="verbatim">-i</code> options.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 mcopy -i my-image-file.bin ::file1 ::file2 .
</pre>
<p>
This copies <code class="verbatim">file1</code> and <code class="verbatim">file2</code> from the image file
(<code class="verbatim">my-image-file.bin</code>) to the <code class="verbatim">/tmp</code> directory.</p>
<p>
You can also supply an offset within the image file by including
=@@=/offset/ into the file name.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 mcopy -i my-image-file.bin@@1M ::file1 ::file2 .
</pre>
<p>
This looks for the image at the offset of 1M in the file, rather than at
its beginning.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-7">
Sizes and offsets
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Certain commands, such as <code class="verbatim">mformat</code>, allow you to specify a hard disk
size.</p>
<p>
The size is a number, followed by an optional unit suffix.</p>
<p>
The number is interpreted as a hexadecimal number if it starts with
<code class="verbatim">0x</code>, as an octal number if it starts with the digit <code class="verbatim">0</code>, or as a
decimal number if it starts with any other digit.</p>
<p>
The following units are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
* 
</dt>
<dd><code class="verbatim">S</code> sectors (of 512 bytes)</dd>
<dt>
* 
</dt>
<dd><code class="verbatim">K</code> Kilobytes</dd>
<dt>
* 
</dt>
<dd><code class="verbatim">M</code> Megabytes</dd>
<dt>
* 
</dt>
<dd><code class="verbatim">G</code> Gigabytes</dd>
<dt>
* 
</dt>
<dd><code class="verbatim">T</code> Terabytes</dd>
</dl>
<p>If no unit is specified, the default depends on context. Mformat&#39;s <code class="verbatim">T</code>
option, and mpartition&#39;s <code class="verbatim">l</code> option assume sectors, whereas all other
places (mshowfat&#39;s <code class="verbatim">o</code> option, <code class="verbatim">offset</code> drive config option and
<code class="verbatim">data_map</code> drive config option) assume bytes.</p>

Current working directory
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The <code class="verbatim">mcd</code> command (∞mcd∫) is used to establish the device and the
current working directory (relative to the MS-DOS file system),
otherwise the default is assumed to be <code class="verbatim">A:/</code>. However, unlike MS-DOS,
there is only one working directory for all drives, and not one per
drive.</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-9">
VFAT-style long file names
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-3">
<p>This version of mtools supports VFAT style long filenames. If a Unix
filename is too long to fit in a short DOS name, it is stored as a VFAT
long name, and a companion short name is generated. This short name is
what you see when you examine the disk with a pre-7.0 version of DOS.
The following table shows some examples of short names:</p>
<pre class="example">
Long name       MS-DOS name     Reason for the change
---------       ----------      ---------------------
thisisatest     THISIS~1        filename too long
alain.knaff     ALAIN~1.KNA     extension too long
prn.txt         PRN~1.TXT       PRN is a device name
.abc            ABC~1           null filename
hot+cold        HOT_CO~1        illegal character
</pre>
<p>
As you see, the following transformations happen to derive a short name:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
* 
</dt>
<dd>Illegal characters are replaced by underscores. The illegal
characters are <code class="verbatim">;+</code>[]&#39;,\&#34;*\\&lt;&gt;/?:|=.</dd>
<dt>
* 
</dt>
<dd>Extra dots, which cannot be interpreted as a main name/extension
separator are removed</dd>
<dt>
* 
</dt>
<dd>A =~=/n/ number is generated,</dd>
<dt>
* 
</dt>
<dd>The name is shortened so as to fit in the 8+3 limitation</dd>
</dl>
<p>The initial Unix-style file name (whether long or short) is also called
the <em>primary</em> name, and the derived short name is also called the
<em>secondary</em> name.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
 mcopy /etc/motd a:Reallylongname
</pre>
<p>
Mtools creates a VFAT entry for Reallylongname, and uses REALLYLO as a
short name. Reallylongname is the primary name, and REALLYLO is the
secondary name.</p>
<pre class="example">
 mcopy /etc/motd a:motd
</pre>
<p>
Motd fits into the DOS filename limits. Mtools doesn&#39;t need to derivate
another name. Motd is the primary name, and there is no secondary name.</p>
<p>
In a nutshell: The primary name is the long name, if one exists, or the
short name if there is no long name.</p>
<p>
Although VFAT is much more flexible than FAT, there are still names that
are not acceptable, even in VFAT. There are still some illegal
characters left (<code class="verbatim">\&#34;*\\&lt;&gt;/?:|</code>), and device names are still reserved.</p>
<pre class="example">
Unix name       Long name       Reason for the change
---------       ----------      ---------------------
prn             prn-1           PRN is a device name
ab:c            ab_c-1          illegal character
</pre>
<p>
As you see, the following transformations happen if a long name is
illegal:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
* 
</dt>
<dd>Illegal characters are replaces by underscores,</dd>
<dt>
* 
</dt>
<dd>A =-=/n/ number is generated,</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="headline-10">
Name clashes
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-3">
<p>When writing a file to disk, its long name or short name may collide
with an already existing file or directory. This may happen for all
commands which create new directory entries, such as <code class="verbatim">mcopy</code>, <code class="verbatim">mmd</code>,
<code class="verbatim">mren</code>, <code class="verbatim">mmove</code>. When a name clash happens, mtools asks you what it
should do. It offers several choices:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<code class="verbatim">overwrite</code> 
</dt>
<dd>Overwrites the existing file. It is not possible to
overwrite a directory with a file.</dd>
<dt>
<code class="verbatim">rename</code> 
</dt>
<dd>Renames the newly created file. Mtools prompts for the
new filename</dd>
<dt>
<code class="verbatim">autorename</code> 
</dt>
<dd>Renames the newly created file. Mtools chooses a name
by itself, without prompting</dd>
<dt>
<code class="verbatim">skip</code> 
</dt>
<dd>Gives up on this file, and moves on to the next (if any)</dd>
</dl>
<p>To chose one of these actions, type its first letter at the prompt. If
you use a lower case letter, the action only applies for this file only,
if you use an upper case letter, the action applies to all files, and
you won&#39;t be prompted again.</p>
<p>
You may also chose actions (for all files) on the command line, when
invoking mtools:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<code class="verbatim">-D o</code> 
</dt>
<dd>Overwrites primary names by default.</dd>
<dt>
<code class="verbatim">-D O</code> 
</dt>
<dd>Overwrites secondary names by default.</dd>
<dt>
<code class="verbatim">-D r</code> 
</dt>
<dd>Renames primary name by default.</dd>
<dt>
<code class="verbatim">-D R</code> 
</dt>
<dd>Renames secondary name by default.</dd>
<dt>
<code class="verbatim">-D a</code> 
</dt>
<dd>Autorenames primary name by default.</dd>
<dt>
<code class="verbatim">-D A</code> 
</dt>
<dd>Autorenames secondary name by default.</dd>
<dt>
<code class="verbatim">-D s</code> 
</dt>
<dd>Skip primary name by default.</dd>
<dt>
<code class="verbatim">-D S</code> 
</dt>
<dd>Skip secondary name by default.</dd>
<dt>
<code class="verbatim">-D m</code> 
</dt>
<dd>Ask user what to do with primary name.</dd>
<dt>
<code class="verbatim">-D M</code> 
</dt>
<dd>Ask user what to do with secondary name.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that for command line switches lower/upper differentiates between
primary/secondary name whereas for interactive choices, lower/upper
differentiates between just-this-time/always.</p>
<p>
The primary name is the name as displayed in Windows 95 or Windows NT:
i.e. the long name if it exists, and the short name otherwise. The
secondary name is the &#34;hidden&#34; name, i.e. the short name if a long name
exists.</p>
<p>
By default, the user is prompted if the primary name clashes, and the
secondary name is autorenamed.</p>
<p>
If a name clash occurs in a Unix directory, mtools only asks whether to
overwrite the file, or to skip it.</p>

<h3 id="headline-11">
Case sensitivity of the VFAT file system
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The VFAT file system is able to remember the case of the filenames.
However, filenames which differ only in case are not allowed to coexist
in the same directory. For example if you store a file called
LongFileName on a VFAT file system, mdir shows this file as
LongFileName, and not as Longfilename. However, if you then try to add
LongFilename to the same directory, it is refused, because case is
ignored for clash checks.</p>
<p>
The VFAT file system allows you to store the case of a filename in the
attribute byte, if all letters of the filename are the same case, and if
all letters of the extension are the same case too. Mtools uses this
information when displaying the files, and also to generate the Unix
filename when mcopying to a Unix directory. This may have unexpected
results when applied to files written using an pre-7.0 version of DOS:
Indeed, the old style filenames map to all upper case. This is different
from the behavior of the old version of mtools which used to generate
lower case Unix filenames.</p>

<h3 id="headline-12">
high capacity formats
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Mtools supports a number of formats which allow storage of more data on
disk than usual. Due to different operating system abilities, these
formats are not supported on all operating systems. Mtools recognizes
these formats transparently where supported.</p>
<p>
In order to format these disks, you need to use an operating system
specific tool. For Linux, suitable floppy tools can be found in the
<code class="verbatim">fdutils</code> package at the following locations~:</p>
<pre class="example">
http://www.fdutils.linux.lu/.
</pre>
<p>
See the manual pages included in that package for further detail: Use
<code class="verbatim">superformat</code> to format all formats except XDF, and use <code class="verbatim">xdfcopy</code> to
format XDF.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-13" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-13">
More sectors
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The oldest method of fitting more data on a disk is to use more sectors
and more cylinders. Although the standard format uses 80 cylinders and
18 sectors (on a 3 1/2 high density disk), it is possible to use up to
83 cylinders (on most drives) and up to 21 sectors. This method allows
to store up to 1743K on a 3 1/2 HD disk. However, 21 sector disks are
twice as slow as the standard 18 sector disks because the sectors are
packed so close together that we need to interleave them. This problem
doesn&#39;t exist for 20 sector formats.</p>
<p>
These formats are supported by numerous DOS shareware utilities such as
<code class="verbatim">fdformat</code> and <code class="verbatim">vgacopy</code>. In his infinite hubris, Bill Gate$ believed
that he invented this, and called it <code class="verbatim">∞DMF disks∫</code>, or
<code class="verbatim">∞Windows formatted disks∫</code>. But in reality, it has already existed
years before! Mtools supports these formats on Linux, on SunOS and on
the DELL Unix PC.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-14" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-14">
Bigger sectors
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-3">
<p>By using bigger sectors it is possible to go beyond the capacity which
can be obtained by the standard 512-byte sectors. This is because of the
sector header. The sector header has the same size, regardless of how
many data bytes are in the sector. Thus, we save some space by using
<em>fewer</em>, but bigger sectors. For example, 1 sector of 4K only takes up
header space once, whereas 8 sectors of 512 bytes have also 8 headers,
for the same amount of useful data.</p>
<p>
This method permits storage of up to 1992K on a 3 1/2 HD disk.</p>
<p>
Mtools supports these formats only on Linux.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-15" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-15">
2m
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The 2m format was originally invented by Ciriaco Garcia de Celis. It
also uses bigger sectors than usual in order to fit more data on the
disk. However, it uses the standard format (18 sectors of 512 bytes
each) on the first cylinder, in order to make these disks easier to
handle by DOS. Indeed this method allows you to have a standard sized
boot sector, which contains a description of how the rest of the disk
should be read.</p>
<p>
However, the drawback of this is that the first cylinder can hold less
data than the others. Unfortunately, DOS can only handle disks where
each track contains the same amount of data. Thus 2m hides the fact that
the first track contains less data by using a <em>shadow</em> FAT. (Usually,
DOS stores the FAT in two identical copies, for additional safety. XDF
stores only one copy, but tells DOS that it stores two. Thus the space
that would be taken up by the second FAT copy is saved.) This also means
that you should <strong>never use a 2m disk</strong> to store anything else than a DOS
file system.</p>
<p>
Mtools supports these formats only on Linux.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-16" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-16">
XDF
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-16" class="outline-text-3">
<p>XDF is a high capacity format used by OS/2. It can hold 1840 K per disk.
That&#39;s lower than the best 2m formats, but its main advantage is that it
is fast: 600 milliseconds per track. That&#39;s faster than the 21 sector
format, and almost as fast as the standard 18 sector format. In order to
access these disks, make sure mtools has been compiled with XDF support,
and set the <code class="verbatim">use_xdf</code> variable for the drive in the configuration file.
See section Compiling mtools, and ∞miscellaneous variables∫, for details
on how to do this. Fast XDF access is only available for Linux kernels
which are more recent than 1.1.34.</p>
<p>
Mtools supports this format only on Linux.</p>
<p>
<strong>Caution / Attention distributors</strong>: If mtools is compiled on a Linux
kernel more recent than 1.3.34, it won&#39;t run on an older kernel.
However, if it has been compiled on an older kernel, it still runs on a
newer kernel, except that XDF access is slower. It is recommended that
distribution authors only include mtools binaries compiled on kernels
older than 1.3.34 until 2.0 comes out. When 2.0 will be out, mtools
binaries compiled on newer kernels may (and should) be distributed.
Mtools binaries compiled on kernels older than 1.3.34 won&#39;t run on any
2.1 kernel or later.</p>

Exit codes
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-17" class="outline-text-3">
<p>All the Mtools commands return 0 on success, 1 on utter failure, or 2 on
partial failure. All the Mtools commands perform a few sanity checks
before going ahead, to make sure that the disk is indeed an MS-DOS disk
(as opposed to, say an ext2 or MINIX disk). These checks may reject
partially corrupted disks, which might otherwise still be readable. To
avoid these checks, set the MTOOLS_SKIP_CHECK environmental variable or
the corresponding configuration file variable (see section global
variables)</p>
