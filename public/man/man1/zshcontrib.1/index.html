DESCRIPTION

<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The Zsh source distribution includes a number of items contributed by
the user community. These are not inherently a part of the shell, and
some may not be available in every zsh installation. The most
significant of these are documented here. For documentation on other
contributed items such as shell functions, look for comments in the
function source files.</p>

Accessing On-Line Help
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The key sequence <strong>ESC h</strong> is normally bound by ZLE to execute the
<strong>run-help</strong> widget (see /zshzle/(1)). This invokes the <strong>run-help</strong> command
with the command word from the current input line as its argument. By
default, <strong>run-help</strong> is an alias for the <strong>man</strong> command, so this often
fails when the command word is a shell builtin or a user-defined
function. By redefining the <strong>run-help</strong> alias, one can improve the
on-line help provided by the shell.</p>
<p>
The <strong>helpfiles</strong> utility, found in the <strong>Util</strong> directory of the
distribution, is a Perl program that can be used to process the zsh
manual to produce a separate help file for each shell builtin and for
many other shell features as well. The autoloadable <strong>run-help</strong> function,
found in <strong>Functions/Misc</strong>, searches for these helpfiles and performs
several other tests to produce the most complete help possible for the
command.</p>
<p>
Help files are installed by default to a subdirectory of
<strong>/usr/share/zsh</strong> or <strong>/usr/local/share/zsh</strong>.</p>
<p>
To create your own help files with <strong>helpfiles</strong>, choose or create a
directory where the individual command help files will reside. For
example, you might choose <strong>~/zsh_help</strong>. If you unpacked the zsh
distribution in your home directory, you would use the commands:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
mkdir ~/zsh_help
perl ~/zsh-5.9/Util/helpfiles ~/zsh_help
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <strong>HELPDIR</strong> parameter tells <strong>run-help</strong> where to look for the help
files. When unset, it uses the default installation path. To use your
own set of help files, set this to the appropriate path in one of your
startup files:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
HELPDIR=~/zsh_help
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
To use the <strong>run-help</strong> function, you need to add lines something like the
following to your <strong>.zshrc</strong> or equivalent startup file:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
unalias run-help
autoload run-help
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that in order for `*autoload run-help*&#39; to work, the <strong>run-help</strong>
file must be in one of the directories named in your <strong>fpath</strong> array (see
/zshparam/(1)). This should already be the case if you have a standard
zsh installation; if it is not, copy <strong>Functions/Misc/run-help</strong> to an
appropriate directory.</p>

Recompiling Functions
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>If you frequently edit your zsh functions, or periodically update your
zsh installation to track the latest developments, you may find that
function digests compiled with the <strong>zcompile</strong> builtin are frequently out
of date with respect to the function source files. This is not usually a
problem, because zsh always looks for the newest file when loading a
function, but it may cause slower shell startup and function loading.
Also, if a digest file is explicitly used as an element of <strong>fpath</strong>, zsh
won&#39;t check whether any of its source files has changed.</p>
<p>
The <strong>zrecompile</strong> autoloadable function, found in <strong>Functions/Misc</strong>, can
be used to keep function digests up to date.</p>
<p>
<strong>zrecompile</strong> [ <strong>-qt</strong> ] [ <em>name</em> … ]</p>
<p>
<strong>zrecompile</strong> [ <strong>-qt</strong> ] <strong>-p</strong> <em>arg</em> … [ <strong>–</strong> <em>arg</em> … ] This tries to
find <strong>*.zwc</strong> files and automatically re-compile them if at least one of
the original files is newer than the compiled file. This works only if
the names stored in the compiled files are full paths or are relative to
the directory that contains the <strong>.zwc</strong> file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first form, each <em>name</em> is the name of a compiled file or a
directory containing <strong>*.zwc</strong> files that should be checked. If no
arguments are given, the directories and <strong>*.zwc</strong> files in <strong>fpath</strong> are
used.</p>
<p>
When <strong>-t</strong> is given, no compilation is performed, but a return status of
zero (true) is set if there are files that need to be re-compiled and
non-zero (false) otherwise. The <strong>-q</strong> option quiets the chatty output
that describes what <strong>zrecompile</strong> is doing.</p>
<p>
Without the <strong>-t</strong> option, the return status is zero if all files that
needed re-compilation could be compiled and non-zero if compilation for
at least one of the files failed.</p>
<p>
If the <strong>-p</strong> option is given, the /arg/s are interpreted as one or more
sets of arguments for <strong>zcompile</strong>, separated by `*–*&#39;. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zrecompile -p \ 
           -R ~/.zshrc -- \ 
           -M ~/.zcompdump -- \ 
           ~/zsh/comp.zwc ~/zsh/Completion/*/_*
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This compiles <strong>~/.zshrc</strong> into <strong>~/.zshrc.zwc</strong> if that doesn&#39;t exist or if
it is older than <strong>~/.zshrc</strong>. The compiled file will be marked for
reading instead of mapping. The same is done for <strong>~/.zcompdump</strong> and
<strong>~/.zcompdump.zwc</strong>, but this compiled file is marked for mapping. The
last line re-creates the file <strong>~/zsh/comp.zwc</strong> if any of the files
matching the given pattern is newer than it.</p>
<p>
Without the <strong>-p</strong> option, <strong>zrecompile</strong> does not create function digests
that do not already exist, nor does it add new functions to the digest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The following shell loop is an example of a method for creating function
digests for all functions in your <strong>fpath</strong>, assuming that you have write
permission to the directories:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
for ((i=1; i &lt;= $#fpath; ++i)); do
  dir=$fpath[i]
  zwc=${dir:t}.zwc
  if [[ $dir == (.|..) || $dir == (.|..)/* ]]; then
    continue
  fi
  files=($dir/*(N-.))
  if [[ -w $dir:h &amp;&amp; -n $files ]]; then
    files=(${${(M)files%/*/*}#/})
    if ( cd $dir:h &amp;&amp;
         zrecompile -p -U -z $zwc $files ); then
      fpath[i]=$fpath[i].zwc
    fi
  fi
done
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <strong>-U</strong> and <strong>-z</strong> options are appropriate for functions in the default
zsh installation <strong>fpath</strong>; you may need to use different options for your
personal function directories.</p>
<p>
Once the digests have been created and your <strong>fpath</strong> modified to refer to
them, you can keep them up to date by running <strong>zrecompile</strong> with no
arguments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-6">
Keyboard Definition
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The large number of possible combinations of keyboards, workstations,
terminals, emulators, and window systems makes it impossible for zsh to
have built-in key bindings for every situation. The <strong>zkbd</strong> utility,
found in <strong>Functions/Misc</strong>, can help you quickly create key bindings for
your configuration.</p>
<p>
Run <strong>zkbd</strong> either as an autoloaded function, or as a shell script:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zsh -f ~/zsh-5.9/Functions/Misc/zkbd
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
When you run <strong>zkbd</strong>, it first asks you to enter your terminal type; if
the default it offers is correct, just press return. It then asks you to
press a number of different keys to determine characteristics of your
keyboard and terminal; <strong>zkbd</strong> warns you if it finds anything out of the
ordinary, such as a Delete key that sends neither <strong>^H</strong> nor <strong>^?</strong>.</p>
<p>
The keystrokes read by <strong>zkbd</strong> are recorded as a definition for an
associative array named <strong>key</strong>, written to a file in the subdirectory
<strong>.zkbd</strong> within either your <strong>HOME</strong> or <strong>ZDOTDIR</strong> directory. The name of
the file is composed from the <strong>TERM</strong>, <strong>VENDOR</strong> and <strong>OSTYPE</strong> parameters,
joined by hyphens.</p>
<p>
You may read this file into your <strong>.zshrc</strong> or another startup file with
the `*source*&#39; or `*.*&#39; commands, then reference the <strong>key</strong> parameter in
bindkey commands, like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
source ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zkbd/$TERM-$VENDOR-$OSTYPE
[[ -n ${key[Left]} ]] &amp;&amp; bindkey &#34;${key[Left]}&#34; backward-char
[[ -n ${key[Right]} ]] &amp;&amp; bindkey &#34;${key[Right]}&#34; forward-char
# etc.
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that in order for `*autoload zkbd*&#39; to work, the <strong>zkdb</strong> file must
be in one of the directories named in your <strong>fpath</strong> array (see
/zshparam/(1)). This should already be the case if you have a standard
zsh installation; if it is not, copy <strong>Functions/Misc/zkbd</strong> to an
appropriate directory.</p>

Dumping Shell State
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Occasionally you may encounter what appears to be a bug in the shell,
particularly if you are using a beta version of zsh or a development
release. Usually it is sufficient to send a description of the problem
to one of the zsh mailing lists (see /zsh/(1)), but sometimes one of the
zsh developers will need to recreate your environment in order to track
the problem down.</p>
<p>
The script named <strong>reporter</strong>, found in the <strong>Util</strong> directory of the
distribution, is provided for this purpose. (It is also possible to
<strong>autoload reporter</strong>, but <strong>reporter</strong> is not installed in <strong>fpath</strong> by
default.) This script outputs a detailed dump of the shell state, in the
form of another script that can be read with `*zsh -f*&#39; to recreate that
state.</p>
<p>
To use <strong>reporter</strong>, read the script into your shell with the `*.*&#39;
command and redirect the output into a file:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
. ~/zsh-5.9/Util/reporter &gt; zsh.report
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
You should check the <strong>zsh.report</strong> file for any sensitive information
such as passwords and delete them by hand before sending the script to
the developers. Also, as the output can be voluminous, it&#39;s best to wait
for the developers to ask for this information before sending it.</p>
<p>
You can also use <strong>reporter</strong> to dump only a subset of the shell state.
This is sometimes useful for creating startup files for the first time.
Most of the output from reporter is far more detailed than usually is
necessary for a startup file, but the <strong>aliases</strong>, <strong>options</strong>, and
<strong>zstyles</strong> states may be useful because they include only changes from
the defaults. The <strong>bindings</strong> state may be useful if you have created any
of your own keymaps, because <strong>reporter</strong> arranges to dump the keymap
creation commands as well as the bindings for every keymap.</p>
<p>
As is usual with automated tools, if you create a startup file with
<strong>reporter</strong>, you should edit the results to remove unnecessary commands.
Note that if you&#39;re using the new completion system, you should <em>not</em>
dump the <strong>functions</strong> state to your startup files with <strong>reporter</strong>; use
the <strong>compdump</strong> function instead (see /zshcompsys/(1)).</p>
<p>
<strong>reporter</strong> [ <em>state</em> … ] Print to standard output the indicated subset
of the current shell state. The <em>state</em> arguments may be one or more of:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>all</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Output everything listed below.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>aliases</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Output alias definitions.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>bindings</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Output ZLE key maps and bindings.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>completion</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Output old-style <strong>compctl</strong> commands. New completion is
covered by <strong>functions</strong> and <strong>zstyles</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>functions</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Output autoloads and function definitions.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>limits</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Output <strong>limit</strong> commands.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>options</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Output <strong>setopt</strong> commands.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>styles</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Same as <strong>zstyles</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>variables</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Output shell parameter assignments, plus <strong>export</strong>
commands for any environment variables.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>zstyles</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Output <strong>zstyle</strong> commands.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the <em>state</em> is omitted, <strong>all</strong> is assumed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
With the exception of `*all*&#39;, every <em>state</em> can be abbreviated by any
prefix, even a single letter; thus <strong>a</strong> is the same as <strong>aliases</strong>, <strong>z</strong> is
the same as <strong>zstyles</strong>, etc.</p>

Manipulating Hook Functions
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-3">
<p><strong>add-zsh-hook</strong> [ <strong>-L</strong> | <strong>-dD</strong> ] [ <strong>-Uzk</strong> ] <em>hook</em> <em>function</em> Several
functions are special to the shell, as described in the section SPECIAL
FUNCTIONS, see /zshmisc/(1), in that they are automatically called at
specific points during shell execution. Each has an associated array
consisting of names of functions to be called at the same point; these
are so-called `hook functions&#39;. The shell function <strong>add-zsh-hook</strong>
provides a simple way of adding or removing functions from the array.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>hook</em> is one of <strong>chpwd</strong>, <strong>periodic</strong>, <strong>precmd</strong>, <strong>preexec</strong>,
<strong>zshaddhistory</strong>, <strong>zshexit</strong>, or <strong>zsh_directory_name</strong>, the special
functions in question. Note that <strong>zsh_directory_name</strong> is called in a
different way from the other functions, but may still be manipulated as
a hook.</p>
<p>
<em>function</em> is name of an ordinary shell function. If no options are
given this will be added to the array of functions to be executed in the
given context. Functions are invoked in the order they were added.</p>
<p>
If the option <strong>-L</strong> is given, the current values for the hook arrays are
listed with <strong>typeset</strong>.</p>
<p>
If the option <strong>-d</strong> is given, the <em>function</em> is removed from the array of
functions to be executed.</p>
<p>
If the option <strong>-D</strong> is given, the <em>function</em> is treated as a pattern and
any matching names of functions are removed from the array of functions
to be executed.</p>
<p>
The options <strong>-U</strong>, <strong>-z</strong> and <strong>-k</strong> are passed as arguments to <strong>autoload</strong>
for <em>function</em>. For functions contributed with zsh, the options <strong>-Uz</strong>
are appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>add-zle-hook-widget</strong> [ <strong>-L</strong> | <strong>-dD</strong> ] [ <strong>-Uzk</strong> ] <em>hook</em>
<em>widgetname</em> :: Several widget names are special to the line editor,
as described in the section Special Widgets, see /zshzle/(1), in that
they are automatically called at specific points during editing.
Unlike function hooks, these do not use a predefined array of other
names to call at the same point; the shell function
<strong>add-zle-hook-widget</strong> maintains a similar array and arranges for the
special widget to invoke those additional widgets.</p>
<p>
<em>hook</em> is one of <strong>isearch-exit</strong>, <strong>isearch-update</strong>, <strong>line-pre-redraw</strong>,
<strong>line-init</strong>, <strong>line-finish</strong>, <strong>history-line-set</strong>, or <strong>keymap-select</strong>,
corresponding to each of the special widgets <strong>zle-isearch-exit</strong>, etc.
The special widget names are also accepted as the <em>hook</em> argument.</p>
<p>
<em>widgetname</em> is the name of a ZLE widget. If no options are given this
is added to the array of widgets to be invoked in the given hook
context. Widgets are invoked in the order they were added, with</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zle widgetname -Nw -f &#34;nolast&#34; -- &#34;$@&#34;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that this means that the `*WIDGET&#39; special parameter tracks the*
/widgetname/* when the widget function is called, rather than
tracking* the name of the corresponding special hook widget.</p>
<p>
If the option <strong>-d is given, the */widgetname/</strong> is removed from* the
array of widgets to be executed.</p>
<p>
If the option <strong>-D is given, the */widgetname/</strong> is treated as a
pattern* and any matching names of widgets are removed from the array.</p>
<p>
If /widgetname/* does not name an existing widget when added to the*
array, it is assumed that a shell function also named /widgetname/*
is* meant to provide the implementation of the widget. This name is
therefore marked for autoloading, and the options <strong>-U, -z and -k are</strong>
passed as arguments to <strong>autoload as with add-zsh-hook. The</strong> widget is
also created with `*zle -N <strong><em>widgetname</em></strong>&#39; to cause the* corresponding
function to be loaded the first time the hook is called.</p>
<p>
The arrays of /widgetname/* are currently maintained in zstyle*
contexts, one for each /hook/* context, with a style of `widgets&#39;.* If
the <strong>-L option is given, this set of styles is listed with</strong> `*zstyle
-L&#39;. This implementation may change, and the special widgets* that
refer to the styles are created only if <strong>add-zle-hook-widget is</strong>
called to add at least one widget, so if this function is used for any
hooks, then all hooks should be managed only via this function.</p>

REMEMBERING RECENT DIRECTORIES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The function <strong>cdr allows you to change the working directory to a</strong>
previous working directory from a list maintained automatically. It is
similar in concept to the directory stack controlled by the <strong>pushd,</strong>
<strong>popd and dirs builtins, but is more configurable, and as it stores</strong> all
entries in files it is maintained across sessions and (by default)
between terminal emulators in the current session. Duplicates are
automatically removed, so that the list reflects the single most recent
use of each directory.</p>
<p>
Note that the <strong>pushd directory stack is not actually modified or used</strong>
by <strong>cdr unless you configure it to do so as described in the</strong>
configuration section below.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-10" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-10">
Installation
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The system works by means of a hook function that is called every time
the directory changes. To install the system, autoload the required
functions and use the <strong>add-zsh-hook function described above:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
autoload -Uz chpwd_recent_dirs cdr add-zsh-hook
add-zsh-hook chpwd chpwd_recent_dirs
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now every time you change directly interactively, no matter which
command you use, the directory to which you change will be remembered in
most-recent-first order.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-11" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-11">
Use
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-3">
<p>All direct user interaction is via the <strong>cdr function.</strong></p>
<p>
The argument to cdr is a number /N/* corresponding to the <strong>/N/*th most</strong>
recently changed-to directory. 1 is the immediately preceding directory;
the current directory is remembered but is not offered as a destination.
Note that if you have multiple windows open 1 may refer to a directory
changed to in another window; you can avoid this by having per-terminal
files for storing directory as described for the <strong>recent-dirs-file style
below.</strong></p>
<p>
If you set the <strong>recent-dirs-default style described below cdr</strong> will
behave the same as <strong>cd if given a non-numeric argument, or more</strong> than
one argument. The recent directory list is updated just the same however
you change directory.</p>
<p>
If the argument is omitted, 1 is assumed. This is similar to <strong>pushd&#39;s</strong>
behaviour of swapping the two most recent directories on the stack.</p>
<p>
Completion for the argument to <strong>cdr is available if compinit has been</strong>
run; menu selection is recommended, using:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:completion:*:*:cdr:*:*&#39; menu selection
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
to allow you to cycle through recent directories; the order is
preserved, so the first choice is the most recent directory before the
current one. The verbose style is also recommended to ensure the
directory is shown; this style is on by default so no action is required
unless you have changed it.</p>

<strong>-l</strong> lists the numbers and the corresponding directories in abbreviated

system.</p>

<dt>
<strong>-e</strong>
</dt>
<dd>allows you to edit the list of directories, one per line. The
list can be edited to any extent you like; no sanity checking is
performed. Completion is available. No quoting is necessary (except
for newlines, where I have in any case no sympathy); directories are
in unabbreviated form and contain an absolute path, i.e. they start
with <strong>/.</strong> Usually the first entry should be left as the current
directory.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-p &#39;*/pattern/</strong>&#39;*
</dt>
<dd>Prunes any items in the directory list that

needed to remove entries with a given* substring.

If output is to a terminal, then the function will print the new list
after pruning and prompt for confirmation by the user. This output and
confirmation step can be skipped by using <strong>-P instead of -p.</strong></dd>

Configuration
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Configuration is by means of the styles mechanism that should be
familiar from completion; if not, see the description of the <strong>zstyle
command in</strong> see /zshmodules/*(1). The context for setting styles* should
be <strong>&#39;:chpwd:</strong>&#39; in case the meaning of the context is extended in*
future, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:chpwd:*&#39; recent-dirs-max 0
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
sets the value of the <strong>recent-dirs-max style to 0. In practice the</strong>
style name is specific enough that a context of &#39;*&#39; should be fine.</p>
<p>
An exception is <strong>recent-dirs-insert, which is used exclusively by the</strong>
completion system and so has the usual completion system context
(<strong>&#39;:completion:</strong>&#39; if nothing more specific is needed), though again*
<strong>&#39;</strong>&#39; should be fine in practice.*</p>
<p>
<strong>recent-dirs-default</strong> If true, and the command is expecting a recent
directory index, and either there is more than one argument or the
argument is not an integer, then fall through to &#34;cd&#34;. This allows the
lazy to use only one command for directory changing. Completion
recognises this, too; see recent-dirs-insert for how to control
completion when this option is in use.</p>

The default is <strong>${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.chpwd-recent-dirs, i.e. this is in
your</strong> home directory unless you have set the variable <strong>ZDOTDIR to
point</strong> somewhere else. Directory names are saved in <strong>$&#39;*/…/</strong>&#39;
quoted* form, so each line in the file can be supplied directly to the
shell as an argument.</p>
<p>
The value of this style may be an array. In this case, the first file
in the list will always be used for saving directories while any other
files are left untouched. When reading the recent directory list, if
there are fewer than the maximum number of entries in the first file,
the contents of later files in the array will be appended with
duplicates removed from the list shown. The contents of the two files
are not sorted together, i.e. all the entries in the first file are
shown first. The special value <strong>+ can appear in the list to</strong> indicate
the default file should be read at that point. This allows effects
like the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:chpwd:*&#39; recent-dirs-file \ 
~/.chpwd-recent-dirs-${TTY##*/} +
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Recent directories are read from a file numbered according to the
terminal. If there are insufficient entries the list is supplemented
from the default file.</p>
<p>
It is possible to use <strong>zstyle -e to make the directory configurable</strong>
at run time:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle -e &#39;:chpwd:*&#39; recent-dirs-file pick-recent-dirs-file
pick-recent-dirs-file() {
  if [[ $PWD = ~/text/writing(|/*) ]]; then
    reply=(~/.chpwd-recent-dirs-writing)
  else
    reply=(+)
  fi
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In this example, if the current directory is <strong>~/text/writing or a</strong>
directory under it, then use a special file for saving recent
directories, else use the default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>recent-dirs-insert</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Used by completion. If <strong>recent-dirs-default is
true, then setting</strong> this to <strong>true causes the actual directory, rather
than its index, to</strong> be inserted on the command line; this has the same
effect as using the corresponding index, but makes the history clearer
and the line easier to edit. With this setting, if part of an argument
was already typed, normal directory completion rather than recent
directory completion is done; this is because recent directory
completion is expected to be done by cycling through entries menu
fashion.

If the value of the style is <strong>always, then only recent directories
will</strong> be completed; in that case, use the <strong>cd command when you want
to</strong> complete other directories.

If the value is <strong>fallback, recent directories will be tried first,
then</strong> normal directory completion is performed if recent directory
completion failed to find a match.

Finally, if the value is <strong>both then both sets of completions are</strong>
presented; the usual tag mechanism can be used to distinguish results,
with recent directories tagged as <strong>recent-dirs. Note that the recent</strong>
directories inserted are abbreviated with directory names where
appropriate.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>recent-dirs-max</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of directories to save to the
file. If this is zero or negative there is no maximum. The default
is 20. Note this includes the current directory, which isn&#39;t offered,
so the highest number of directories you will be offered is one less
than the maximum.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>recent-dirs-prune</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This style is an array determining what
directories should (or should not) be added to the recent list.
Elements of the array can include:</p>
<p>
<strong>parent</strong> Prune parents (more accurately, ancestors) from the recent
list. If present, changing directly down by any number of directories
causes the current directory to be overwritten. For example, changing
from ~pws to ~pws/some/other/dir causes ~pws not to be left on the
recent directory stack. This only applies to direct changes to
descendant directories; earlier directories on the list are not
pruned. For example, changing from ~pws/yet/another to
~pws/some/other/dir does not cause ~pws to be pruned.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
*pattern:*/pattern/
</dt>
<dd>Gives a zsh pattern for directories that
should not be added to the recent list (if not already there). This
element can be repeated to add different patterns. For example,
<strong>&#39;pattern:/tmp(|/</strong>)&#39; stops /tmp or its descendants* from being
added. The <strong>EXTENDED_GLOB option is always turned on</strong> for these
patterns.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>recent-dirs-pushd</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to true, <strong>cdr will use pushd instead of
cd to change the</strong> directory, so the directory is saved on the
directory stack. As the directory stack is completely separate from
the list of files saved by the mechanism used in this file there is no
obvious reason to do this.</dd>

Details of directory handling
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-3">
<p>This section is for the curious or confused; most users will not need to
know this information.</p>
<p>
Recent directories are saved to a file immediately and hence are
preserved across sessions. Note currently no file locking is applied:
the list is updated immediately on interactive commands and nowhere else
(unlike history), and it is assumed you are only going to change
directory in one window at once. This is not safe on shared accounts,
but in any case the system has limited utility when someone else is
changing to a different set of directories behind your back.</p>
<p>
To make this a little safer, only directory changes instituted from the
command line, either directly or indirectly through shell function calls
(but not through subshells, evals, traps, completion functions and the
like) are saved. Shell functions should use <strong>cd -q or pushd -q to</strong> avoid
side effects if the change to the directory is to be invisible at the
command line. See the contents of the function <strong>chpwd_recent_dirs for</strong>
more details.</p>

ABBREVIATED DYNAMIC REFERENCES TO DIRECTORIES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-16" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The dynamic directory naming system is described in the subsection
<em>Dynamic named directories/* of* the section /Filename Expansion/* in
<strong>/zshexpn/*(1). In this, a reference to</strong> <strong>~[</strong></em>…/*] is expanded by a
function found by the hooks* mechanism.</p>
<p>
The contributed function <strong>zsh_directory_name_generic provides a</strong> system
allowing the user to refer to directories with only a limited amount of
new code. It supports all three of the standard interfaces for directory
naming: converting from a name to a directory, converting in the reverse
direction to find a short name, and completion of names.</p>
<p>
The main feature of this function is a path-like syntax, combining
abbreviations at multiple levels separated by &#34;:&#34;. As an example,
~[g:p:s] might specify:</p>
<p>
<strong>g</strong> The top level directory for your git area. This first component has
to match, or the function will return indicating another directory name
hook function should be tried.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>p</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The name of a project within your git area.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>s</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The source area within that project. This allows you to
collapse references to long hierarchies to a very compact form,
particularly if the hierarchies are similar across different areas of
the disk.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Name components may be completed: if a description is shown at the top
of the list of completions, it includes the path to which previous
components expand, while the description for an individual completion
shows the path segment it would add. No additional configuration is
needed for this as the completion system is aware of the dynamic
directory name mechanism.</p>

<h3 id="headline-17">
Usage
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-17" class="outline-text-3">
<p>To use the function, first define a wrapper function for your specific
case. We&#39;ll assume it&#39;s to be autoloaded. This can have any name but
we&#39;ll refer to it as zdn_mywrapper. This wrapper function will define
various variables and then call this function with the same arguments
that the wrapper function gets. This configuration is described below.</p>
<p>
Then arrange for the wrapper to be run as a zsh_directory_name hook:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
autoload -Uz add-zsh-hook zsh_directory_name_generic zdn_mywrapper
add-zsh-hook -U zsh_directory_name zdn_mywrapper
</pre>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-18" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-18">
Configuration
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-18" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The wrapper function should define a local associative array zdn_top.
Alternatively, this can be set with a style called <strong>mapping. The</strong>
context for the style is <strong>:zdn:*/wrapper-name/</strong> where* /wrapper-name/*
is the function calling zsh_directory_name_generic;* for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle :zdn:zdn_mywrapper: mapping zdn_mywrapper_top
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The keys in this associative array correspond to the first component of
the name. The values are matching directories. They may have an optional
suffix with a slash followed by a colon and the name of a variable in
the same format to give the next component. (The slash before the colon
is to disambiguate the case where a colon is needed in the path for a
drive. There is otherwise no syntax for escaping this, so path
components whose names start with a colon are not supported.) A special
component <strong>:default: specifies a variable in the form</strong> <strong><em>:*/var</em></strong> (the
path section is ignored and so is usually empty)* that will be used for
the next component if no variable is given for the path. Variables
referred to within <strong>zdn_top have the same format as</strong> <strong>zdn_top itself,
but contain relative paths.</strong></p>
<p>
For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
local -A zdn_top=(
  g   ~/git
  ga  ~/alternate/git
  gs  /scratch/$USER/git/:second2
  :default: /:second1
)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This specifies the behaviour of a directory referred to as <strong>~[g:…]</strong> or
<strong>~[ga:…] or ~[gs:…]. Later path components are optional;</strong> in that
case <strong>~[g] expands to ~/git, and so on. gs expands</strong> to
<strong>/scratch/$USER/git and uses the associative array second2 to</strong> match the
second component; <strong>g and ga use the associative array</strong> <strong>second1 to match
the second component.</strong></p>
<p>
When expanding a name to a directory, if the first component is not <strong>g
or</strong> <strong>ga or gs, it is not an error; the function simply returns 1 so that
a</strong> later hook function can be tried. However, matching the first
component commits the function, so if a later component does not match,
an error is printed (though this still does not stop later hooks from
being executed).</p>
<p>
For components after the first, a relative path is expected, but note
that multiple levels may still appear. Here is an example of <strong>second1:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
local -A second1=(
  p   myproject
  s   somproject
  os  otherproject/subproject/:third
)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The path as found from <strong>zdn_top is extended with the matching</strong>
directory, so <strong>~[g:p] becomes ~/git/myproject. The slash between</strong> is
added automatically (it&#39;s not possible to have a later component modify
the name of a directory already matched). Only <strong>os specifies</strong> a variable
for a third component, and there&#39;s no <strong>:default:, so it&#39;s</strong> an error to
use a name like <strong>~[g:p:x] or ~[ga:s:y] because</strong> there&#39;s nowhere to look
up the <strong>x or y.</strong></p>
<p>
The associative arrays need to be visible within this function; the
generic function therefore uses internal variable names beginning <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">zdn</span>
in order to avoid clashes. Note that the variable reply</strong> needs to be
passed back to the shell, so should not be local in the calling
function.</p>
<p>
The function does not test whether directories assembled by component
actually exist; this allows the system to work across automounted file
systems. The error from the command trying to use a non-existent
directory should be sufficient to indicate the problem.</p>

Complete example
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-19" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Here is a full fictitious but usable autoloadable definition of the
example function defined by the code above. So <strong>~[gs:p:s] expands</strong> to
<strong>/scratch/$USER/git/myscratchproject/top/srcdir (with $USER</strong> also
expanded).</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
local -A zdn_top=(
  g   ~/git
  ga  ~/alternate/git
  gs  /scratch/$USER/git/:second2

<p>
It is also possible to use global associative arrays, suitably named,
and set the style for the context of your wrapper function to refer to
this. Then your set up code would contain the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
typeset -A zdn_mywrapper_top=(...)
# ... and so on for other associative arrays ...
zstyle &#39;:zdn:zdn_mywrapper:&#39; mapping zdn_mywrapper_top
autoload -Uz add-zsh-hook zsh_directory_name_generic zdn_mywrapper
add-zsh-hook -U zsh_directory_name zdn_mywrapper

<h3 id="headline-21">
Quickstart
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-21" class="outline-text-3">
<p>To get this feature working quickly (including colors), you can do the
following (assuming, you loaded <strong>vcs_info properly - see above):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:vcs_info:*&#39; actionformats \ 
    &#39;%F{5}(%f%s%F{5})%F{3}-%F{5}[%F{2}%b%F{3}|%F{1}%a%F{5}]%f &#39;
zstyle &#39;:vcs_info:*&#39; formats       \

zstyle &#39;:vcs_info:(sv[nk]|bzr):*&#39; branchformat &#39;%b%F{1}:%F{3}%r&#39;
precmd () { vcs_info }
PS1=&#39;%F{5}[%F{2}%n%F{5}] %F{3}%3~ ${vcs_info_msg_0_}%f%# &#39;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Obviously, the last two lines are there for demonstration. You need to
call <strong>vcs_info from your precmd function. Once that is done you need</strong> a
/single quoted/* &#39;${vcs_info_msg_0_}&#39; in your prompt.*</p>
<p>
To be able to use <strong>&#39;${vcs_info_msg_0_}&#39; directly in your prompt like</strong>
this, you will need to have the <strong>PROMPT_SUBST option enabled.</strong></p>
<p>
Now call the <strong>vcs_info_printsys utility from the command line:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
% vcs_info_printsys
## list of supported version control backends:
## disabled systems are prefixed by a hash sign (#)
bzr
cdv
cvs
darcs
fossil
git
hg
mtn
p4
svk
svn
tla
## flavours (cannot be used in the enable or disable styles; they
## are enabled and disabled with their master [git-svn -&gt; git])
## they *can* be used in contexts: &#39;:vcs_info:git-svn:*&#39;.
git-p4
git-svn
hg-git
hg-hgsubversion
hg-hgsvn
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
You may not want all of these because there is no point in running the
code to detect systems you do not use. So there is a way to disable some
backends altogether:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:vcs_info:*&#39; disable bzr cdv darcs mtn svk tla
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
You may also pick a few from that list and enable only those:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:vcs_info:*&#39; enable git cvs svn
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you rerun <strong>vcs_info_printsys after one of these commands, you will</strong>
see the backends listed in the <strong>disable style (or backends not in the</strong>
<strong>enable style - if you used that) marked as disabled by a hash sign.</strong>
That means the detection of these systems is skipped /completely/*. No*
wasted time there.</p>

<strong>check-for-changes</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If enabled, this style causes the *%c*/ and
<em><strong>%u</strong></em> format escapes to show/ when the working directory has
uncommitted changes. The strings displayed by these escapes can be
controlled via the <strong>stagedstr*/ and /*unstagedstr</strong> styles. The only
backends that currently support this option are *git*/,/ *hg*/, and
<em><strong>bzr</strong></em> (the latter two only support unstaged)./

For this style to be evaluated with the <strong>hg*/ backend, the
/*get-revision</strong> style needs to be set and the *use-simple*/ style
needs to be unset. The/ latter is the default; the former is not.

With the *bzr*/ backend, lightweight checkouts only honor this style
if/ the *use-server*/ style is set./

Note, the actions taken if this style is enabled are potentially
expensive (read: they may be slow, depending on how big the current
repository is). Therefore, it is disabled by default.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>check-for-staged-changes</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This style is like *check-for-changes*/,
but it never checks the worktree/ files, only the metadata in the
*.${vcs}*/ dir. Therefore,/ this style initializes only the *%c*/
escape (with <em><strong>stagedstr</strong></em>) but/ not the *%u*/ escape. This style is
faster than <em><strong>check-for-changes</strong></em>./

In the *git*/ backend, this style checks for changes in the index./
Other backends do not currently implement this style.

<strong>command</strong>

<p>This style causes *vcs_info*/ to use the supplied string
as the command/ to use as the VCS&#39;s binary. Note, that setting this in
&#39;*:vcs_info:**/&#39; is/ not a good idea.</p>
<p>
If the value of this style is empty (which is the default), the used
binary name is the name of the backend in use (e.g. <strong>svn*/ is used in
an /*svn</strong> repository).</p>
<p>
The <strong>repo-root-name*/ part in the context is always the default
/</strong>-all-* when this style is looked up.</p>
<p>
For example, this style can be used to use binaries from non-default
installation directories. Assume, *git*/ is installed in <em>usr/bin but</em>
your sysadmin installed a newer version in <em>usr/local/bin. Instead of
changing the order of your <strong>$PATH</strong></em> parameter, you can do this:/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:vcs_info:git:*:-all-&#39; command /usr/local/bin/git
</pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>use-server</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is used by the Perforce backend (*p4*/) to decide
if it should/ contact the Perforce server to find out if a directory
is managed by Perforce. This is the only reliable way of doing this,
but runs the risk of a delay if the server name cannot be found. If
the server (more specifically, the <em>host/*:*/port pair describing the</em>
server) cannot be contacted, its name is put into the associative
array *vcs_info_p4_dead_servers*/ and is not contacted again during
the session/ until it is removed by hand. If you do not set this
style, the <strong>p4</strong> backend is only usable if you have set the environment
variable *P4CONFIG*/ to a file name and have corresponding files in
the root/ directories of each Perforce client. See comments in the
function *VCS_INFO_detect_p4*/ for more detail./

The Bazaar backend (*bzr*/) uses this to permit contacting the server/
about lightweight checkouts, see the *check-for-changes*/ style./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>use-simple</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If there are two different ways of gathering
information, you can select the simpler one by setting this style to
true; the default is to use the not-that-simple code, which is
potentially a lot slower but might be more accurate in all possible
cases. This style is used by the *bzr*/, <em><strong>hg</strong></em>, and <em><strong>git</strong></em> backends.
In the case of <em><strong>hg</strong></em> it will invoke/ the external hexdump program to
parse the binary dirstate cache file; this method will not return the
local revision number.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>get-revision</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to true, vcs_info goes the extra mile to
figure out the revision of a repository&#39;s work tree (currently for the
*git*/ and <em><strong>hg</strong></em> backends,/ where this kind of information is not
always vital). For <strong>git*/, the/ hash value of the currently checked
out commit is available via the *%i</strong> expansion. With *hg*/, the local
revision number and the corresponding/ global hash are available via
*%i*/./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>get-mq</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to true, the *hg*/ backend will look for a

<p>If you want to use the *%b*/ (bold off) prompt expansion in
<em><strong>formats</strong></em>,/ which expands <strong>%b*/ itself, use <em><strong>%%b</strong></em>. That will cause

prompt expansion/ mechanism can handle it. Similarly, to hand down *%b*/

Quilt Support
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-24" class="outline-text-3">
<p>*Quilt*/ is not a version control system, therefore this is not
implemented/ as a backend. It can help keeping track of a series of
patches. People use it to keep a set of changes they want to use on top
of software packages (which is tightly integrated into the package build
process - the Debian project does this for a large number of packages).
Quilt can also help individual developers keep track of their own
patches on top of real version control systems.</p>
<p>
The *vcs_info*/ integration tries to support both ways of using quilt
by/ having two slightly different modes of operation: `addon&#39; mode and
`standalone&#39; mode).</p>
<p>
Quilt integration is off by default; to enable it, set the *use-quilt*/
style,/ and add *%Q*/ to your <em><strong>formats</strong></em> or <em><strong>actionformats</strong></em> style:/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:vcs_info:*&#39; use-quilt true
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Styles looked up from the Quilt support code include
`*.quilt-*/quilt-mode&#39;/ in the <em>vcs-string part of the context, where
quilt-mode is either</em> *addon*/ or <em><strong>standalone</strong></em>./ Example:
*:vcs_info:git.quilt-addon:default:*/repo-root-name./</p>
<p>
For `addon&#39; mode to become active *vcs_info*/ must have already detected
a/ real version control system controlling the directory. If that is the
case, a directory that holds quilt&#39;s patches needs to be found. That
directory is configurable via the `*QUILT_PATCHES*/&#39; environment
variable. If that/ variable exists its value is used, otherwise the
value `*patches*/&#39; is/ assumed. The value from *$QUILT_PATCHES*/ can be
overwritten using the/ `*quilt-patch-dir*/&#39; style. (Note: you can use
/*vcs_info*/ to keep the value/ of *$QUILT_PATCHES*/ correct all the
time via the <em><strong>post-quilt</strong></em> hook)./</p>
<p>
When the directory in question is found, quilt is assumed to be active.
To gather more information, *vcs_info*/ looks for a directory called
`.pc&#39;;/ Quilt uses that directory to track its current state. If this
directory does not exist we know that quilt has not done anything to the
working directory (read: no patches have been applied yet).</p>
<p>
If patches are applied, *vcs_info*/ will try to find out which. If you
want/ to know which patches of a series are not yet applied, you need to
activate the *get-unapplied*/ style in the appropriate context./</p>
<p>
*vcs_info*/ allows for very detailed control over how the gathered/
information is presented (see the *Configuration*/ and <em><strong>Hooks in
vcs_info</strong></em> sections),/ all of which are documented below. Note there are
a number of other patch tracking systems that work on top of a certain
version control system (like *stgit*/ for <em><strong>git</strong></em>, or <em><strong>mq</strong></em> for
<em><strong>hg</strong></em>); the configuration/ for systems like that are generally
configured the same way as the <strong>quilt</strong> support.</p>
<p>
If the *quilt*/ support is working in `addon&#39; mode, the produced string
is/ available as a simple format replacement (*%Q*/ to be precise),
which can/ be used in *formats*/ and <em><strong>actionformats</strong></em>; see below for
details)./</p>
<p>
If, on the other hand, the support code is working in `standalone&#39; mode,
*vcs_info*/ will pretend as if <em><strong>quilt</strong></em> were an actual version control/
system. That means that the version control system identifier (which
otherwise would be something like `svn&#39; or `cvs&#39;) will be set to
`*-quilt-*/&#39;. This has implications on the used style context where
this/ identifier is the second element. *vcs_info*/ will have filled in
a proper/ value for the &#34;repository&#39;s&#34; root directory and the string
containing the information about quilt&#39;s state will be available as the
`misc&#39; replacement (and *%Q*/ for compatibility with `addon&#39; mode)./</p>
<p>
What is left to discuss is how `standalone&#39; mode is detected. The
detection itself is a series of searches for directories. You can have
this detection enabled all the time in every directory that is not
otherwise under version control. If you know there is only a limited set
of trees where you would like *vcs_info*/ to try and look for Quilt in
`standalone&#39; mode to minimise/ the amount of searching on every call to
*vcs_info*/, there are a number of/ ways to do that:</p>
<p>
Essentially, `standalone&#39; mode detection is controlled by a style called
`*quilt-standalone*/&#39;. It is a string style and its value can have
different/ effects. The simplest values are: `*always*/&#39; to run
detection every time/ *vcs_info*/ is run, and `/*never*/&#39; to turn the
detection off entirely./</p>
<p>
If the value of *quilt-standalone*/ is something else, it is
interpreted/ differently. If the value is the name of a scalar variable
the value of that variable is checked and that value is used in the same
`always&#39;/`never&#39; way as described above.</p>
<p>
If the value of *quilt-standalone*/ is an array, the elements of that
array/ are used as directory names under which you want the detection to
be active.</p>
<p>
If *quilt-standalone*/ is an associative array, the keys are taken as/
directory names under which you want the detection to be active, but
only if the corresponding value is the string `*true*/&#39;./</p>
<p>
Last, but not least, if the value of *quilt-standalone*/ is the name of
a/ function, the function is called without arguments and the return
value decides whether detection should be active. A `0&#39; return value is
true; a non-zero return value is interpreted as false.</p>
<p>
Note, if there is both a function and a variable by the name of
*quilt-standalone*/, the function will take precedence./</p>

Hooks in vcs_info
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-27" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Hooks are places in *vcs_info*/ where you can run your own code. That/
code can communicate with the code that called it and through that,
change the system&#39;s behaviour.</p>
<p>
For configuration, hooks change the style context:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
:vcs_info:vcs-string+hook-name:user-context:repo-root-name
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
To register functions to a hook, you need to list them in the <strong>hooks</strong>
style in the appropriate context.</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:vcs_info:*+foo:*&#39; hooks bar baz
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This registers functions to the hook `foo&#39; for all backends. In order to
avoid namespace problems, all registered function names are prepended by
a `*+vi-*/&#39;, so the actual functions called for the `foo&#39; hook are/
`*+vi-bar*/&#39; and `/*+vi-baz*/&#39;./</p>
<p>
If you would like to register a function to a hook regardless of the
current context, you may use the *vcs_info_hookadd*/ function. To
remove/ a function that was added like that, the *vcs_info_hookdel*/
function/ can be used.</p>
<p>
If something seems weird, you can enable the `debug&#39; boolean style in
the proper context and the hook-calling code will print what it tried to
execute and whether the function in question existed.</p>
<p>
When you register more than one function to a hook, all functions are
executed one after another until one function returns non-zero or until
all functions have been called. Context-sensitive hook functions are
executed *before*/ statically registered ones (the ones added by/
*vcs_info_hookadd*/)./</p>
<p>
You may pass data between functions via an associative array,
*user_data*/./ For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
+vi-git-myfirsthook(){
    user_data[myval]=$myval
}
+vi-git-mysecondhook(){
    # do something with ${user_data[myval]}
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are a number of variables that are special in hook contexts:</p>
<p>
<strong>ret</strong> The return value that the hooks system will return to the caller.
The default is an integer `zero&#39;. If and how a changed *ret*/ value
changes/ the execution of the caller depends on the specific hook. See
the hook documentation below for details.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>hook_com</strong>
</dt>
<dd>An associated array which is used for bidirectional
communication from the caller to hook functions. The used keys depend
on the specific hook.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>context</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The active context of the hook. Functions that wish to
change this variable should make it local scope first.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>vcs</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The current VCS after it was detected. The same values as in
the enable/disable style are used. Available in all hooks except
*start-up*/./</dd>
</dl>
<p>Finally, the full list of currently available hooks:</p>
<p>
<strong>start-up</strong> Called after starting *vcs_info*/ but before the VCS in this
directory is/ determined. It can be used to deactivate *vcs_info*/
temporarily if/ necessary. When *ret*/ is set to <em><strong>1</strong></em>, <em><strong>vcs_info</strong></em>
aborts and does/ nothing; when set to *2*/, <em><strong>vcs_info</strong></em> sets up
everything as if no/ version control were active and exits.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>pre-get-data</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Same as *start-up*/ but after the VCS was detected./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>gen-hg-bookmark-string</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Called in the Mercurial backend when a
bookmark string is generated; the *get-revision*/ and
<em><strong>get-bookmarks</strong></em> styles must be true./

This hook gets the names of the Mercurial bookmarks that *vcs_info*/
collected from `hg&#39;./

If a bookmark is active, the key *${hook_com[hg-active-bookmark]}*/
is/ set to its name. The key is otherwise unset.

When setting *ret*/ to non-zero, the string in/
*${hook_com[hg-bookmark-string]}*/ will be used in the /*%m*/ escape
in/ *formats*/ and /*actionformats*/ and will be available in the
global/ *backend_misc*/ array as /*${backend_misc[bookmarks]}*/./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>gen-applied-string</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Called in the <strong>git*/ (with <em><strong>stgit</strong></em> or during
rebase or merge), and /*hg</strong> (with <strong>mq*/) backends and in <em><strong>quilt</strong></em>
support when the /*applied-string</strong> is generated; the <strong>use-quilt*/
zstyle must be true for <em><strong>quilt</strong></em> (the /*mq</strong> and *stgit*/ backends are
active by default)./

The arguments to this hook describe applied patches in the opposite
order, which means that the first argument is the top-most patch and
so forth.

When the patches&#39; log messages can be extracted, those are embedded
within each argument after a space, so each argument is of the form
`/patch-name first line of the log message&#39;, where patch-name/
contains no whitespace. The *mq*/ backend passes arguments of/ the
form `/patch name&#39;, with possible embedded spaces, but without/
extracting the patch&#39;s log message.

When setting *ret*/ to non-zero, the string in/
*${hook_com[applied-string]}*/ will be/ available as *%p*/ in the
<em><strong>patch-format</strong></em> and <em><strong>nopatch-format</strong></em> styles./ This hook is, in
concert with *set-patch-format*/, responsible for/ *%*/-escaping that
value for use in the prompt./ (See the *Oddities*/ section.)/

The *quilt*/ backend passes to this hook the inputs/
*${hook_com[quilt-patches-dir]}*/ and, if it has been/ determined,
*${hook_com[quilt-pc-dir]}*/./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>gen-unapplied-string</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Called in the *git*/ (with <em><strong>stgit</strong></em> or
during rebase), and <em><strong>hg</strong></em> (with/ *mq*/) backend and in <em><strong>quilt</strong></em>
support when the <em><strong>unapplied-string</strong></em> is/ generated; the
*get-unapplied*/ style must be true./

This hook gets the names of all unapplied patches which <strong>vcs_info</strong> in
order, which means that the first argument is the patch next-in-line
to be applied and so forth.

The format of each argument is as for *gen-applied-string*/, above./

When setting *ret*/ to non-zero, the string in/
*${hook_com[unapplied-string]}*/ will be available as <em><strong>%u</strong></em> in the/
*patch-format*/ and <em><strong>nopatch-format</strong></em> styles./ This hook is, in
concert with *set-patch-format*/, responsible for/ *%*/-escaping that
value for use in the prompt./ (See the *Oddities*/ section.)/

The *quilt*/ backend passes to this hook the inputs/
*${hook_com[quilt-patches-dir]}*/ and, if it has been/ determined,
*${hook_com[quilt-pc-dir]}*/./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>gen-mqguards-string</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Called in the *hg*/ backend when
<em><strong>guards-string</strong></em> is generated; the/ *get-mq*/ style must be true
(default)./

This hook gets the names of any active *mq*/ guards./

When setting *ret*/ to non-zero, the string in/
*${hook_com[guards-string]}*/ will be used in the <em><strong>%g</strong></em> escape in
the/ *patch-format*/ and <em><strong>nopatch-format</strong></em> styles./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>no-vcs</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This hooks is called when no version control system was
detected.

The `*hook_com*/&#39; parameter is not used./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>post-backend</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Called as soon as the backend has finished
collecting information.

The `*hook_com*/&#39; keys available are as for the <em><strong>set-message</strong></em> hook./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>post-quilt</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Called after the *quilt*/ support is done. The
following information/ is passed as arguments to the hook: 1. the
quilt-support mode (`addon&#39; or `standalone&#39;); 2. the directory that
contains the patch series; 3. the directory that holds quilt&#39;s status
information (the `.pc&#39; directory) or the string *&#34;-nopc-&#34;*/ if that
directory wasn&#39;t found./

The `hook_com&#39; parameter is not used.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>set-branch-format</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Called before `*branchformat*/&#39; is set. The
only argument to the/ hook is the format that is configured at this
point.

The `*hook_com*/&#39; keys considered are `/*branch*/&#39; and
`/*revision*/&#39;./ They are set to the values figured out so far by
*vcs_info*/ and any/ change will be used directly when the actual
replacement is done.

If *ret*/ is set to non-zero, the string in/
*${hook_com[branch-replace]}*/ will be used unchanged as the/ `*%b*/&#39;
replacement in the variables set by <em><strong>vcs_info</strong></em>./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>set-hgrev-format</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Called before a `*hgrevformat*/&#39; is set. The
only argument to the/ hook is the format that is configured at this
point.

The `*hook_com*/&#39; keys considered are `/*hash*/&#39; and `/*localrev*/&#39;./
They are set to the values figured out so far by *vcs_info*/ and any/
change will be used directly when the actual replacement is done.

If *ret*/ is set to non-zero, the string in/
*${hook_com[rev-replace]}*/ will be used unchanged as the/ `*%i*/&#39;
replacement in the variables set by <em><strong>vcs_info</strong></em>./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>pre-addon-quilt</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This hook is used when *vcs_info*/&#39;s quilt
functionality is active in &#34;addon&#34;/ mode (quilt used on top of a real
version control system). It is activated right before any quilt
specific action is taken.

Setting the `*ret*/&#39; variable in this hook to a non-zero value avoids
any/ quilt specific actions from being run at all.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>set-patch-format</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This hook is used to control some of the
possible expansions in *patch-format*/ and <em><strong>nopatch-format</strong></em> styles
with patch queue systems such as/ quilt, mqueue and the like.

This hook is used in the *git*/, <em><strong>hg</strong></em> and <em><strong>quilt</strong></em> backends./

The hook allows the control of the <strong>%p*/ (<em><strong>${hook_com[applied]}</strong></em>)
and /*%u</strong> (*${hook_com[unapplied]}*/) expansion in all backends that
use the hook. With/ the mercurial backend, the *%g*/
(/*${hook_com[guards]}*/) expansion is/ controllable in addition to
that.

If <strong>ret*/ is set to non-zero, the string in
/*${hook_com[patch-replace]}</strong> will be used unchanged instead of an
expanded format from *patch-format*/ or/ *nopatch-format*/./

This hook is, in concert with the *gen-applied-string*/ or/
*gen-unapplied-string*/ hooks if they are defined, responsible for/
*%*/-escaping the final <em><strong>patch-format</strong></em> value for use in the prompt./
(See the *Oddities*/ section.)/

The *quilt*/ backend passes to this hook the inputs/
*${hook_com[quilt-patches-dir]}*/ and, if it has been/ determined,
*${hook_com[quilt-pc-dir]}*/./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>set-message</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Called each time before a `*vcs_info_msg_*/N/*_*/&#39;
message is set./ It takes two arguments; the first being the `/N&#39; in
the message/ variable name, the second is the currently configured
*formats*/ or/ *actionformats*/./

There are a number of `*hook_com*/&#39; keys, that are used here:/
`*action*/&#39;, `/*branch*/&#39;, `/*base*/&#39;, `/*base-name*/&#39;, `/*subdir*/&#39;,/
`*staged*/&#39;, `/*unstaged*/&#39;, `/*revision*/&#39;, `/*misc*/&#39;, `/*vcs*/&#39;/
and one `*miscN*/&#39; entry for each backend-specific data field (/*N*
starting at zero). They are set to the values figured out so far by
*vcs_info*/ and any change will be used directly when the actual/
replacement is done.

Since this hook is triggered multiple times (once for each configured
*formats*/ or <em><strong>actionformats</strong></em>), each of the `/*hook_com*/&#39; keys
mentioned/ above (except for the *miscN*/ entries) has an `/*_orig*/&#39;
counterpart,/ so even if you changed a value to your liking you can
still get the original value in the next run. Changing the `*_orig*/&#39;
values is/ probably not a good idea.

If *ret*/ is set to non-zero, the string in/ *${hook_com[message]}*/
will be used unchanged as the message by/ *vcs_info*/./</dd>

</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
All *%x*/ expansion in all sorts of formats (<em><strong>formats</strong></em>,
<em><strong>actionformats</strong></em>,/ *branchformat*/, you name it) are done using the
`/*zformat*/&#39; builtin from/ the `*zsh/zutil*/&#39; module. That means you
can do everything with these/ *%x*/ items what zformat supports. In
particular, if you want something/ that is really long to have a fixed
width, like a hash in a mercurial branchformat, you can do this:
<strong>%12.12i*/. That&#39;ll shrink the 40 character/ hash to its 12 leading
characters. The form is actually `*%*/min/</strong>.*/max/*x*/&#39;. More is
possible./ See the section `The zsh/zutil Module&#39; in <em>zshmodules(1) for
details.</em></p>
<p>
Use the quicker *bzr*/ backend/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:vcs_info:bzr:*&#39; use-simple true
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you do use *use-simple*/, please report if it does
`the-right-thing[tm]&#39;./</p>
<p>
Display the revision number in yellow for *bzr*/ and <em><strong>svn</strong></em>:/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:vcs_info:(svn|bzr):*&#39; \ 
       branchformat &#39;%b%%F{yellow}:%r&#39;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The doubled percent sign is explained in the *Oddities*/ section./</p>
<p>
Alternatively, one can use the raw colour codes directly:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:vcs_info:(svn|bzr):*&#39; \ 
       branchformat &#39;%b%{&#39;${fg[yellow]}&#39;%}:%r&#39;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Normally when a variable is interpolated into a format string, the
variable needs to be *%*/-escaped. In this example we skipped that
because we assume/ the value of *${fg[yellow]}*/ doesn&#39;t contain any
<em><strong>%</strong></em> signs./</p>
<p>
Make sure you enclose the color codes in <strong>%{*/…/*%}</strong> if you want to
use the string provided by *vcs_info*/ in prompts./</p>
<p>
Here is how to print the VCS information as a command (not in a prompt):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
vcsi() { vcs_info interactive; vcs_info_lastmsg }
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This way, you can even define different formats for output via
<strong>vcs_info_lastmsg*/ in the &#39;/</strong>:vcs_info:*:interactive:**/&#39; namespace./</p>
<p>
Now as promised, some code that uses hooks: say, you&#39;d like to replace
the string `svn&#39; by `subversion&#39; in *vcs_info*/&#39;s <em><strong>%s</strong></em> <em><strong>formats</strong></em>
replacement./</p>
<p>
First, we will tell *vcs_info*/ to call a function when populating/ the
message variables with the gathered information:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:vcs_info:*+set-message:*&#39; hooks svn2subversion
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nothing happens. Which is reasonable, since we didn&#39;t define the actual
function yet. To see what the hooks subsystem is trying to do, enable
the `*debug*/&#39; style:/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:vcs_info:*+*:*&#39; debug true
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
That should give you an idea what is going on. Specifically, the
function that we are looking for is `*+vi-svn2subversion*/&#39;. Note, the
`/*+vi-*/&#39;/ prefix. So, everything is in order, just as documented. When
you are done checking out the debugging output, disable it again:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:vcs_info:*+*:*&#39; debug false
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now, let&#39;s define the function:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
function +vi-svn2subversion() {
    [[ ${hook_com[vcs_orig]} == svn ]] &amp;&amp; hook_com[vcs]=subversion
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Simple enough. And it could have even been simpler, if only we had
registered our function in a less generic context. If we do it only in
the `*svn*/&#39; backend&#39;s context, we don&#39;t need to test which the active/
backend is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:vcs_info:svn+set-message:*&#39; hooks svn2subversion
</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
function +vi-svn2subversion() {
    hook_com[vcs]=subversion
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
And finally a little more elaborate example, that uses a hook to create
a customised bookmark string for the *hg*/ backend./</p>
<p>
Again, we start off by registering a function:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:vcs_info:hg+gen-hg-bookmark-string:*&#39; hooks hgbookmarks
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
And then we define the `*+vi-hgbookmarks*/&#39; function:/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
function +vi-hgbookmarks() {
    # The default is to connect all bookmark names by
    # commas. This mixes things up a little.
    # Imagine, there&#39;s one type of bookmarks that is
    # special to you. Say, because it&#39;s *your* work.
    # Those bookmarks look always like this: &#34;sh/*&#34;
    # (because your initials are sh, for example).
    # This makes the bookmarks string use only those
    # bookmarks. If there&#39;s more than one, it
    # concatenates them using commas.
    # The bookmarks returned by `hg&#39; are available in
    # the function&#39;s positional parameters.
    local s=&#34;${(Mj:,:)@:#sh/*}&#34;
    # Now, the communication with the code that calls
    # the hook functions is done via the hook_com[]
    # hash. The key at which the `gen-hg-bookmark-string&#39;
    # hook looks is `hg-bookmark-string&#39;. So:
    hook_com[hg-bookmark-string]=$s
    # And to signal that we want to use the string we
    # just generated, set the special variable `ret&#39; to
    # something other than the default zero:
    ret=1
    return 0
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

Writing Themes

<p>
bash-style word functions If you are looking for functions to implement
moving over and editing words in the manner of bash, where only
alphanumeric characters are considered word characters, you can use the
functions described in the next section. The following is sufficient:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
autoload -U select-word-style
select-word-style bash
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>forward-word-match*/, /*backward-word-match</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>kill-word-match*/, /*backward-kill-word-match</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>transpose-words-match*/, /*capitalize-word-match</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>up-case-word-match*/, /*down-case-word-match</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>delete-whole-word-match*/, /*select-word-match</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>select-word-style*/, <em><strong>match-word-context</strong></em>, /*match-words-by-style</strong>
The first eight `*-match*/&#39; functions are drop-in replacements for the/
builtin widgets without the suffix. By default they behave in a similar
way. However, by the use of styles and the function
*select-word-style*/,/ the way words are matched can be altered.
*select-word-match*/ is intended/ to be used as a text object in vi mode
but with custom word styles. For comparison, the widgets described in
<em>zshzle(1) under Text Objects use fixed definitions of words,
compatible</em> with the *vim*/ editor./</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The simplest way of configuring the functions is to use
*select-word-style*/, which can either be called as a normal function
with/ the appropriate argument, or invoked as a user-defined widget that
will prompt for the first character of the word style to be used. The
first time it is invoked, the first eight *-match*/ functions will
automatically/ replace the builtin versions, so they do not need to be
loaded explicitly.</p>
<p>
The word styles available are as follows. Only the first character is
examined.</p>
<p>
<strong>bash</strong> Word characters are alphanumeric characters only.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>normal</strong>
</dt>
<dd>As in normal shell operation: word characters are
alphanumeric characters plus any characters present in the string
given by the parameter *$WORDCHARS*/./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>shell</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Words are complete shell command arguments, possibly
including complete quoted strings, or any tokens special to the shell.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>whitespace</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Words are any set of characters delimited by
whitespace.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>default</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Restore the default settings; this is usually the same as
`*normal*/&#39;./</dd>
</dl>
<p>All but `*default*/&#39; can be input as an upper case character, which has/
the same effect but with subword matching turned on. In this case, words
with upper case characters are treated specially: each separate run of
upper case characters, or an upper case character followed by any number
of other characters, is considered a word. The style <strong>subword-range</strong> can
supply an alternative character range to the default `*[:upper:]*/&#39;;/
the value of the style is treated as the contents of a `*[*/…/*]*/&#39;/
pattern (note that the outer brackets should not be supplied, only those
surrounding named ranges).</p>
<p>
More control can be obtained using the *zstyle*/ command, as described
in/ <em>zshmodules(1). Each style is looked up in the</em> context
*:zle:*/widget where widget is the name of the/ user-defined widget, not
the name of the function implementing it, so in the case of the
definitions supplied by *select-word-style*/ the/ appropriate contexts
are <strong>:zle:forward-word*/, and so on. The function/ *select-word-style*/
itself always defines styles for the context/ `</strong>:zle:**/&#39; which can be
overridden by more specific (longer) patterns as/ well as explicit
contexts.</p>
<p>
The style *word-style*/ specifies the rules to use. This may have the/
following values.</p>
<p>
<strong>normal</strong> Use the standard shell rules, i.e. alphanumerics and
*$WORDCHARS*/, unless/ overridden by the styles *word-chars*/ or
<em><strong>word-class</strong></em>./</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>specified</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Similar to *normal*/, but only the specified
characters, and not also/ alphanumerics, are considered word
characters.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>unspecified</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The negation of specified. The given characters are
those which will <em>not be considered part of a word.</em></dd>
<dt>
<strong>shell</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Words are obtained by using the syntactic rules for
generating shell command arguments. In addition, special tokens which
are never command arguments such as `*()*/&#39; are also treated as
words./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>whitespace</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Words are whitespace-delimited strings of characters.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The first three of those rules usually use *$WORDCHARS*/, but the value/
in the parameter can be overridden by the style *word-chars*/, which
works/ in exactly the same way as *$WORDCHARS*/. In addition, the style/
*word-class*/ uses character class syntax to group characters and takes/
precedence over *word-chars*/ if both are set. The <em><strong>word-class</strong></em> style/
does not include the surrounding brackets of the character class; for
example, `*-:[:alnum:]*/&#39; is a valid <em><strong>word-class</strong></em> to include all/
alphanumerics plus the characters `*-<strong><em>&#39; and `</em></strong>:*/&#39;. Be careful/
including `*]*/&#39;, `/*^*/&#39; and `/*-*/&#39; as these are special inside/
character classes.</p>
<p>
<strong>word-style*/ may also have `/</strong>-subword*/&#39; appended to its value to/
turn on subword matching, as described above.</p>
<p>
The style *skip-chars*/ is mostly useful for/ *transpose-words*/ and
similar functions. If set, it gives a count of/ characters starting at
the cursor position which will not be considered part of the word and
are treated as space, regardless of what they actually are. For example,
if</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:zle:transpose-words&#39; skip-chars 1
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
has been set, and *transpose-words-match*/ is called with the cursor on/
the <em>X of /*foo*/X/*bar*</em>, where X can be any character, then/ the
resulting expression is *bar*/X/*foo*/./</p>
<p>
Finer grained control can be obtained by setting the style
<strong>word-context</strong> to an array of pairs of entries. Each pair of entries
consists of a <em>pattern and a subcontext. The shell argument the cursor
is on is</em> matched against each <em>pattern in turn until one matches; if it
does,</em> the context is extended by a colon and the corresponding
<em>subcontext.</em> Note that the test is made against the original word on
the line, with no stripping of quotes. Special handling is done between
words: the current context is examined and if it contains the string
*between*/ the word/ is set to a single space; else if it is contains
the string *back*/,/ the word before the cursor is considered, else the
word after cursor is considered. Some examples are given below.</p>
<p>
The style <strong>skip-whitespace-first*/ is only used with the/
*forward-word*/ widget. If it is set to true, then /*forward-word</strong> skips
any non-word-characters, followed by any non-word-characters: this is
similar to the behaviour of other word-orientated widgets, and also that
used by other editors, however it differs from the standard zsh
behaviour. When using *select-word-style*/ the widget/ is set in the
context *:zle:**/ to <em><strong>true</strong></em> if the word style is/ *bash*/ and
<em><strong>false</strong></em> otherwise. It may be overridden by setting it in/ the more
specific context *:zle:forward-word**/./</p>
<p>
It is possible to create widgets with specific behaviour by defining a
new widget implemented by the appropriate generic function, then setting
a style for the context of the specific widget. For example, the
following defines a widget *backward-kill-space-word*/ using/
*backward-kill-word-match*/, the generic widget implementing/
*backward-kill-word*/ behaviour, and ensures that the new widget/ always
implements space-delimited behaviour.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zle -N backward-kill-space-word backward-kill-word-match
zstyle :zle:backward-kill-space-word word-style space
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The widget *backward-kill-space-word*/ can now be bound to a key./</p>
<p>
Here are some further examples of use of the styles, actually taken from
the simplified interface in *select-word-style*/:/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:zle:*&#39; word-style standard
zstyle &#39;:zle:*&#39; word-chars &#39;&#39;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Implements bash-style word handling for all widgets, i.e. only
alphanumerics are word characters; equivalent to setting the parameter
*WORDCHARS*/ empty for the given context./</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
style &#39;:zle:*kill*&#39; word-style space
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Uses space-delimited words for widgets with the word `kill&#39; in the name.
Neither of the styles *word-chars*/ nor <em><strong>word-class</strong></em> is used in this
case./</p>
<p>
Here are some examples of use of the *word-context*/ style to extend/
the context.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:zle:*&#39; word-context \ 
       &#34;*/*&#34; filename &#34;[[:space:]]&#34; whitespace
zstyle &#39;:zle:transpose-words:whitespace&#39; word-style shell
zstyle &#39;:zle:transpose-words:filename&#39; word-style normal
zstyle &#39;:zle:transpose-words:filename&#39; word-chars &#39;&#39;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This provides two different ways of using *transpose-words*/ depending
on/ whether the cursor is on whitespace between words or on a filename,
here any word containing a */*/. On whitespace, complete arguments as
defined/ by standard shell rules will be transposed. In a filename, only
alphanumerics will be transposed. Elsewhere, words will be transposed
using the default style for *:zle:transpose-words*/./</p>
<p>
The word matching and all the handling of *zstyle*/ settings is
actually/ implemented by the function *match-words-by-style*/. This can
be used to/ create new user-defined widgets. The calling function should
set the local parameter <strong>curcontext*/ to /</strong>:zle:*/widget, create the
local/ parameter *matched_words*/ and call <em><strong>match-words-by-style</strong></em> with
no/ arguments. On return, *matched_words*/ will be set to an array with
the/ elements: (1) the start of the line (2) the word before the cursor
(3) any non-word characters between that word and the cursor (4) any
non-word character at the cursor position plus any remaining non-word
characters before the next word, including all characters specified by
the *skip-chars*/ style, (5) the word at or following the cursor (6)
any/ non-word characters following that word (7) the remainder of the
line. Any of the elements may be an empty string; the calling function
should test for this to decide whether it can perform its function.</p>
<p>
If the variable <strong>matched_words*/ is defined by the caller to/
*match-words-by-style*/ as an associative array (/*local -A</strong>
matched_words/), then the seven values given above should be retrieved/
from it as elements named *start*/, <em><strong>word-before-cursor</strong></em>,/
*ws-before-cursor*/, <em><strong>ws-after-cursor</strong></em>, <em><strong>word-after-cursor</strong></em>,/
*ws-after-word*/, and <em><strong>end</strong></em>. In addition the element/ *is-word-start*/
is 1 if the cursor is on the start of a word or/ subword, or on white
space before it (the cases can be distinguished by testing the
*ws-after-cursor*/ element) and 0 otherwise. This form is/ recommended
for future compatibility.</p>
<p>
It is possible to pass options with arguments to <strong>match-words-by-style</strong>
to override the use of styles. The options are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-w</strong>
</dt>
<dd><em>word-style</em></dd>
<dt>
<strong>-s</strong>
</dt>
<dd><em>skip-chars</em></dd>
<dt>
<strong>-c</strong>
</dt>
<dd><em>word-class</em></dd>
<dt>
<strong>-C</strong>
</dt>
<dd><em>word-chars</em></dd>
<dt>
<strong>-r</strong>
</dt>
<dd><em>subword-range</em></dd>
</dl>
<p>For example, *match-words-by-style -w shell -c 0*/ may be used to/
extract the command argument around the cursor.</p>
<p>
The *word-context*/ style is implemented by the function/
*match-word-context*/. This should not usually need to be called/
directly.</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<strong>bracketed-paste-magic</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The *bracketed-paste*/ widget (see the
subsection `Miscellaneous&#39; in/ <em>zshzle(1))</em> inserts pasted text
literally into the editor buffer rather than interpret it as
keystrokes. This disables some common usages where the self-insert
widget is replaced in order to accomplish some extra processing. An
example is the contributed *url-quote-magic*/ widget described below./</p>
<p>
The <strong>bracketed-paste-magic*/ widget is meant to replace
/*bracketed-paste</strong> with a wrapper that re-enables these self-insert
actions, and other actions as selected by zstyles. Therefore this
widget is installed with</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
autoload -Uz bracketed-paste-magic
zle -N bracketed-paste bracketed-paste-magic
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Other than enabling some widget processing, <strong>bracketed-paste-magic</strong>
attempts to replicate *bracketed-paste*/ as faithfully as possible./</p>
<p>
The following zstyles may be set to control processing of pasted text.
All are looked up in the context `*:bracketed-paste-magic*/&#39;./</p>
<p>
<strong>active-widgets</strong> A list of patterns matching widget names that should
be activated during the paste. All other key sequences are processed
as self-insert-unmeta. The default is `*self-**/&#39; so any user-defined
widgets named with that/ prefix are active along with the builtin
self-insert.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this style is not set (explicitly deleted) or set to an empty
value, no widgets are active and the pasted text is inserted
literally. If the value includes `*undefined-key*/&#39;, any unknown
sequences are discarded/ from the pasted text.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>inactive-keys</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The inverse of *active-widgets*/, a list of key
sequences that always use/ *self-insert-unmeta*/ even when bound to
an active widget. Note that/ this is a list of literal key
sequences, not patterns.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>paste-init</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>A list of function names, called in widget context
(but not as widgets). The functions are called in order until one of
them returns a non-zero status. The parameter `*PASTED*/&#39; contains
the initial state of the/ pasted text. All other ZLE parameters such
as `*BUFFER*/&#39; have their/ normal values and side-effects, and full
history is available, so for example *paste-init*/ functions may
move words from <em><strong>BUFFER</strong></em> into/ *PASTED*/ to make those words
visible to the <em><strong>active-widgets</strong></em>./</p>
<p>
A non-zero return from a *paste-init*/ function does not prevent
the/ paste itself from proceeding.</p>
<p>
Loading *bracketed-paste-magic*/ defines <em><strong>backward-extend-paste</strong></em>,
a/ helper function for use in *paste-init*/./</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle :bracketed-paste-magic paste-init \ 
       backward-extend-paste
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
When a paste would insert into the middle of a word or append text
to a word already on the line, *backward-extend-paste*/ moves the
prefix/ from *LBUFFER*/ into <em><strong>PASTED</strong></em> so that the
<em><strong>active-widgets</strong></em> see the/ full word so far. This may be useful
with *url-quote-magic*/./</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>paste-finish</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Another list of function names called in order
until one returns non-zero. These functions are called <em>after the
pasted text has been processed</em> by the *active-widgets*/, but before
it is inserted into `/*BUFFER*/&#39;./ ZLE parameters have their normal
values and side-effects.</p>
<p>
A non-zero return from a *paste-finish*/ function does not prevent/
the paste itself from proceeding.</p>
<p>
Loading *bracketed-paste-magic*/ also defines <em><strong>quote-paste</strong></em>, a
helper/ function for use in *paste-finish*/./</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle :bracketed-paste-magic paste-finish \ 
       quote-paste
zstyle :bracketed-paste-magic:finish quote-style \ 
       qqq
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
When the pasted text is inserted into *BUFFER*/, it is quoted per
the/ *quote-style*/ value. To forcibly turn off the built-in numeric
prefix/ quoting of *bracketed-paste*/, use:/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle :bracketed-paste-magic:finish quote-style \ 
       none
</pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>Important: During /*active-widgets*</em> processing of the paste (after/
*paste-init*/ and before <em><strong>paste-finish</strong></em>), <em><strong>BUFFER</strong></em> starts empty
and/ history is restricted, so cursor motions, etc., may not pass
outside of the pasted content. Text assigned to *BUFFER*/ by the
active widgets/ is copied back into *PASTED*/ before
<em><strong>paste-finish</strong></em>./</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>copy-earlier-word</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This widget works like a combination of
*insert-last-word*/ and/ *copy-prev-shell-word*/. Repeated invocations
of the widget retrieve/ earlier words on the relevant history line.
With a numeric argument <em>N, insert the Nth word from the history line;
N may be</em> negative to count from the end of the line.

If *insert-last-word*/ has been used to retrieve the last word on a/
previous history line, repeated invocations will replace that word
with earlier words from the same line.

Otherwise, the widget applies to words on the line currently being
edited. The *widget*/ style can be set to the name of another widget
that should/ be called to retrieve words. This widget must accept the
same three arguments as *insert-last-word*/./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>cycle-completion-positions</strong>
</dt>
<dd>After inserting an unambiguous string
into the command line, the new function based completion system may
know about multiple places in this string where characters are missing
or differ from at least one of the possible matches. It will then
place the cursor on the position it considers to be the most
interesting one, i.e. the one where one can disambiguate between as
many matches as possible with as little typing as possible.

This widget allows the cursor to be easily moved to the other
interesting spots. It can be invoked repeatedly to cycle between all
positions reported by the completion system.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>delete-whole-word-match</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is another function which works like
the *-match*/ functions/ described immediately above, i.e. using
styles to decide the word boundaries. However, it is not a replacement
for any existing function.</p>
<p>
The basic behaviour is to delete the word around the cursor. There is
no numeric argument handling; only the single word around the cursor
is considered. If the widget contains the string *kill*/, the removed
text/ will be placed in the cutbuffer for future yanking. This can be
obtained by defining *kill-whole-word-match*/ as follows:/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zle -N kill-whole-word-match delete-whole-word-match
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
and then binding the widget *kill-whole-word-match*/./</p>
</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>up-line-or-beginning-search*/,
/*down-line-or-beginning-search</strong> :: These widgets are similar to the
builtin functions <strong>up-line-or-search</strong> and *down-line-or-search*/: if
in a multiline buffer they move up or/ down within the buffer,
otherwise they search for a history line matching the start of the
current line. In this case, however, they search for a line which
matches the current line up to the current cursor position, in the
manner of <strong>history-beginning-search-backward*/ and /</strong>-forward*/,
rather/ than the first word on the line.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>edit-command-line</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Edit the command line using your visual editor,
as in *ksh*/./</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
bindkey -M vicmd v edit-command-line
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The editor to be used can also be specified using the *editor*/ style
in/ the context of the widget. It is specified as an array of command
and arguments:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle :zle:edit-command-line editor gvim -f
</pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>expand-absolute-path</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Expand the file name under the cursor to an
absolute path, resolving symbolic links. Where possible, the initial
path segment is turned into a named directory or reference to a user&#39;s
home directory.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>history-search-end</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This function implements the widgets
*history-beginning-search-backward-end*/ and/
*history-beginning-search-forward-end*/. These commands work by first/
calling the corresponding builtin widget (see `History Control&#39; in
<em>zshzle(1)) and then moving the cursor to the end of the line. The
original cursor</em> position is remembered and restored before calling
the builtin widget a second time, so that the same search is repeated
to look farther through the history.</p>
<p>
Although you *autoload*/ only one function, the commands to use it
are/ slightly different because it implements two widgets.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zle -N history-beginning-search-backward-end \ 
       history-search-end
zle -N history-beginning-search-forward-end \ 
       history-search-end
bindkey &#39;\e^P&#39; history-beginning-search-backward-end
bindkey &#39;\e^N&#39; history-beginning-search-forward-end
</pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>history-beginning-search-menu</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This function implements yet
another form of history searching. The text before the cursor is used
to select lines from the history, as for
*history-beginning-search-backward*/ except that all matches are/
shown in a numbered menu. Typing the appropriate digits inserts the
full history line. Note that leading zeroes must be typed (they are
only shown when necessary for removing ambiguity). The entire history
is searched; there is no distinction between forwards and backwards.</p>
<p>
With a numeric argument, the search is not anchored to the start of
the line; the string typed by the use may appear anywhere in the line
in the history.</p>
<p>
If the widget name contains `*-end*/&#39; the cursor is moved to the end
of/ the line inserted. If the widget name contains `*-space*/&#39; any
space/ in the text typed is treated as a wildcard and can match
anything (hence a leading space is equivalent to giving a numeric
argument). Both forms can be combined, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zle -N history-beginning-search-menu-space-end \ 
       history-beginning-search-menu
</pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>history-pattern-search</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The function *history-pattern-search*/
implements widgets which prompt/ for a pattern with which to search
the history backwards or forwards. The pattern is in the usual zsh
format, however the first character may be *^*/ to anchor the search
to the start of the line, and the last character/ may be *$*/ to
anchor the search to the end of the line. If the/ search was not
anchored to the end of the line the cursor is positioned just after
the pattern found.</p>
<p>
The commands to create bindable widgets are similar to those in the
example immediately above:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
autoload -U history-pattern-search
zle -N history-pattern-search-backward history-pattern-search
zle -N history-pattern-search-forward history-pattern-search
</pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>incarg</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Typing the keystrokes for this widget with the cursor
placed on or to the left of an integer causes that integer to be
incremented by one. With a numeric argument, the number is incremented
by the amount of the argument (decremented if the numeric argument is
negative). The shell parameter *incarg*/ may be set to change the
default increment to/ something other than one.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
bindkey &#39;^X+&#39; incarg
</pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>incremental-complete-word</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This allows incremental completion of a
word. After starting this command, a list of completion choices can be
shown after every character you type, which you can delete with *^H*/
or <em><strong>DEL</strong></em>. Pressing return/ accepts the completion so far and returns
you to normal editing (that is, the command line is <em>not immediately
executed). You can hit /*TAB*</em> to/ do normal completion, *^G*/ to
abort back to the state when you started,/ and *^D*/ to list the
matches./</p>
<p>
This works only with the new function based completion system.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
bindkey &#39;^Xi&#39; incremental-complete-word
</pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>insert-composed-char</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This function allows you to compose
characters that don&#39;t appear on the keyboard to be inserted into the
command line. The command is followed by two keys corresponding to
ASCII characters (there is no prompt). For accented characters, the
two keys are a base character followed by a code for the accent, while
for other special characters the two characters together form a
mnemonic for the character to be inserted. The two-character codes are
a subset of those given by RFC 1345 (see for example

<p>
The function may optionally be followed by up to two characters which
replace one or both of the characters read from the keyboard; if both
characters are supplied, no input is read. For example,
*insert-composed-char a:*/ can be used within a widget to insert an a
with/ umlaut into the command line. This has the advantages over use
of a literal character that it is more portable.</p>
<p>
For best results zsh should have been built with support for multibyte
characters (configured with *–enable-multibyte*/); however, the
function/ works for the limited range of characters available in
single-byte character sets such as ISO-8859-1.</p>
<p>
The character is converted into the local representation and inserted
into the command line at the cursor position. (The conversion is done
within the shell, using whatever facilities the C library provides.)
With a numeric argument, the character and its code are previewed in
the status line</p>
<p>
The function may be run outside zle in which case it prints the
character (together with a newline) to standard output. Input is still
read from keystrokes.</p>
<p>
See *insert-unicode-char*/ for an alternative way of inserting
Unicode/ characters using their hexadecimal character number.</p>
<p>
The set of accented characters is reasonably complete up to Unicode
character U+0180, the set of special characters less so. However, it
is very sporadic from that point. Adding new characters is easy,
however; see the function *define-composed-chars*/. Please send any/
additions to *zsh-workers@zsh.org*/./</p>

<strong>narrow-to-region-invisible</strong> Narrow the editable portion of the buffer
to the region between the cursor and the mark, which may be in either
order. The region may not be empty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*narrow-to-region*/ may be used as a widget or called as a function from
a/ user-defined widget; by default, the text outside the editable area
remains visible. A *recursive-edit*/ is performed and the original
widening/ status is then restored. Various options and arguments are
available when it is called as a function.</p>
<p>
The options <strong>-p*/ pretext and /</strong>-P*/ posttext may be/ used to replace
the text before and after the display for the duration of the function;
either or both may be an empty string.</p>
<p>
If the option *-n*/ is also given, pretext or posttext will only/ be
inserted if there is text before or after the region respectively which
will be made invisible.</p>
<p>
Two numeric arguments may be given which will be used instead of the
cursor and mark positions.</p>
<p>
The option *-S*/ statepm is used to narrow according to the other/
options while saving the original state in the parameter with name
<em>statepm, while the option /*-R*</em> statepm is used to restore the/ state
from the parameter; note in both cases the <em>name of the parameter</em> is
required. In the second case, other options and arguments are
irrelevant. When this method is used, no *recursive-edit*/ is
performed;/ the calling widget should call this function with the option
*-S*/,/ perform its own editing on the command line or pass control to
the user via `*zle recursive-edit*/&#39;, then call this function with the
option/ *-R*/. The argument statepm must be a suitable name for an
ordinary/ parameter, except that parameters beginning with the prefix
*_ntr_*/ are/ reserved for use within *narrow-to-region*/. Typically the
parameter will/ be local to the calling function.</p>
<p>
The options <strong>-l*/ lbufvar and /</strong>-r*/ rbufvar may be used to/ specify
parameters where the widget will store the resulting text from the
operation. The parameter <em>lbufvar will contain /*LBUFFER* and /rbufvar
will contain /*RBUFFER*</em>. Neither of these two options/ may be used with
<strong>-S*/ or /</strong>-R*/./</p>
<p>
*narrow-to-region-invisible*/ is a simple widget which calls/
<strong>narrow-to-region*/ with arguments which replace any text outside the/
region with `</strong>…*/&#39;. It does not take any arguments./</p>
<p>
The display is restored (and the widget returns) upon any zle command
which would usually cause the line to be accepted or aborted. Hence an
additional such command is required to accept or abort the current line.</p>
<p>
The return status of both widgets is zero if the line was accepted, else
non-zero.</p>
<p>
Here is a trivial example of a widget using this feature.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
local state
narrow-to-region -p $&#39;Editing restricted region\n&#39; \ 
  -P &#39;&#39; -S state
zle recursive-edit
narrow-to-region -R state
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>predict-on</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This set of functions implements predictive typing
using history search. After *predict-on*/, typing characters causes
the editor to look backward/ in the history for the first line
beginning with what you have typed so far. After *predict-off*/,
editing returns to normal for the line found./ In fact, you often
don&#39;t even need to use *predict-off*/, because if the/ line doesn&#39;t
match something in the history, adding a key performs standard
completion, and then inserts itself if no completions were found.
However, editing in the middle of a line is liable to confuse
prediction; see the *toggle*/ style below./</p>
<p>
With the function based completion system (which is needed for this),
you should be able to type *TAB*/ at almost any point to advance the
cursor/ to the next ``interesting&#39;&#39; character position (usually the
end of the current word, but sometimes somewhere in the middle of the
word). And of course as soon as the entire line is what you want, you
can accept with return, without needing to move the cursor to the end
first.</p>
<p>
The first time *predict-on*/ is used, it creates several additional/
widget functions:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>delete-backward-and-predict</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Replaces the <strong>backward-delete-char</strong>
widget. You do not need to bind this yourself.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>insert-and-predict</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Implements predictive typing by replacing
the *self-insert*/ widget. You do not need to bind this yourself./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>predict-off</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Turns off predictive typing.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Although you *autoload*/ only the <em><strong>predict-on</strong></em> function, it is/
necessary to create a keybinding for *predict-off*/ as well./</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zle -N predict-on
zle -N predict-off
bindkey &#39;^X^Z&#39; predict-on
bindkey &#39;^Z&#39; predict-off
</pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>read-from-minibuffer</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is most useful when called as a
function from inside a widget, but will work correctly as a widget in
its own right. It prompts for a value below the current command line;
a value may be input using all of the standard zle operations (and not
merely the restricted set available when executing, for example,
*execute-named-cmd*/). The value is then/ returned to the calling
function in the parameter *$REPLY*/ and the/ editing buffer restored
to its previous state. If the read was aborted by a keyboard break
(typically *^G*/), the function returns status 1/ and *$REPLY*/ is not
set./

If one argument is supplied to the function it is taken as a prompt,
otherwise `*? */&#39; is used. If two arguments are supplied, they are
the/ prompt and the initial value of *$LBUFFER*/, and if a third
argument is/ given it is the initial value of *$RBUFFER*/. This
provides a default/ value and starting cursor placement. Upon return
the entire buffer is the value of *$REPLY*/./

One option is available: `*-k*/ num&#39; specifies that num/ characters
are to be read instead of a whole line. The line editor is not invoked
recursively in this case, so depending on the terminal settings the
input may not be visible, and only the input keys are placed in
*$REPLY*/, not the entire buffer. Note that unlike the <em><strong>read</strong></em>
builtin/ <em>num must be given; there is no default.</em>

The name is a slight misnomer, as in fact the shell&#39;s own minibuffer
is not used. Hence it is still possible to call *executed-named-cmd*/
and/ similar functions while reading a value.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>replace-argument*/, /*replace-argument-edit</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The function
*replace-argument*/ can be used to replace a command/ line argument in
the current command line or, if the current command line is empty, in
the last command line executed (the new command line is not executed).
Arguments are as delimited by standard shell syntax,</p>
<p>
If a numeric argument is given, that specifies the argument to be
replaced. 0 means the command name, as in history expansion. A
negative numeric argument counts backward from the last word.</p>
<p>
If no numeric argument is given, the current argument is replaced;
this is the last argument if the previous history line is being used.</p>
<p>
The function prompts for a replacement argument.</p>
<p>
If the widget contains the string *edit*/, for example is defined as/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zle -N replace-argument-edit replace-argument
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
then the function presents the current value of the argument for
editing, otherwise the editing buffer for the replacement is initially
empty.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>replace-string*/, /*replace-pattern</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>replace-string-again*/, /*replace-pattern-again</strong> The function
*replace-string*/ implements three widgets./ If defined under the same
name as the function, it prompts for two strings; the first (source)
string will be replaced by the second everywhere it occurs in the line
editing buffer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the widget name contains the word `*pattern*/&#39;, for example by/
defining the widget using the command `*zle -N replace-pattern*
replace-string/&#39;, then the matching is performed using zsh patterns.
All/ zsh extended globbing patterns can be used in the source string;
note that unlike filename generation the pattern does not need to match
an entire word, nor do glob qualifiers have any effect. In addition, the
replacement string can contain parameter or command substitutions.
Furthermore, a `*&amp;*/&#39; in the replacement string will be replaced with/
the matched source string, and a backquoted digit `*\*/N&#39; will be/
replaced by the <em>Nth parenthesised expression matched. The form</em>
`*\{<strong><em>N</em></strong>}*/&#39; may be used to protect the digit from following/ digits.</p>
<p>
If the widget instead contains the word `*regex*/&#39; (or `/*regexp*/&#39;),/
then the matching is performed using regular expressions, respecting the
setting of the option *RE_MATCH_PCRE*/ (see the description of the/
function *regexp-replace*/ below). The special replacement facilities/
described above for pattern matching are available.</p>
<p>
By default the previous source or replacement string will not be offered
for editing. However, this feature can be activated by setting the style
<strong>edit-previous*/ in the context /</strong>:zle:*/widget (for example,/
*:zle:replace-string*/) to <em><strong>true</strong></em>. In addition, a positive/ numeric
argument forces the previous values to be offered, a negative or zero
argument forces them not to be.</p>
<p>
The function *replace-string-again*/ can be used to repeat the previous/
replacement; no prompting is done. As with *replace-string*/, if the
name/ of the widget contains the word `*pattern*/&#39; or `/*regex*/&#39;,
pattern or/ regular expression matching is performed, else a literal
string replacement. Note that the previous source and replacement text
are the same whether pattern, regular expression or string matching is
used.</p>
<p>
In addition, *replace-string*/ shows the previous replacement above/ the
prompt, so long as there was one during the current session; if the
source string is empty, that replacement will be repeated without the
widget prompting for a replacement string.</p>
<p>
For example, starting from the line:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
print This line contains fan and fond
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
and invoking *replace-pattern*/ with the source string/ `*f(?)n*/&#39; and/
the replacement string `*c\1r*/&#39; produces the not very useful line:/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
print This line contains car and cord
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The range of the replacement string can be limited by using the
*narrow-to-region-invisible*/ widget. One limitation of the current/
version is that *undo*/ will cycle through changes to the replacement/
and source strings before undoing the replacement itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>send-invisible</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is similar to read-from-minibuffer in that it
may be called as a function from a widget or as a widget of its own,
and interactively reads input from the keyboard. However, the input
being typed is concealed and a string of asterisks (`***/&#39;) is shown
instead. The value is saved in/ the parameter *$INVISIBLE*/ to which a
reference is inserted into the/ editing buffer at the restored cursor
position. If the read was aborted by a keyboard break (typically
*^G*/) or another escape from editing such/ as *push-line*/,
/*$INVISIBLE*/ is set to empty and the original buffer/ is restored
unchanged.

If one argument is supplied to the function it is taken as a prompt,
otherwise `*Non-echoed text: */&#39; is used (as in emacs). If a second
and/ third argument are supplied they are used to begin and end the
reference to *$INVISIBLE*/ that is inserted into the buffer. The
default is to/ open with *${<strong><em>, then /*INVISIBLE*</em>, and close with
/</strong>}*/, but many/ other effects are possible.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>smart-insert-last-word</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This function may replace the
*insert-last-word*/ widget, like so:/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zle -N insert-last-word smart-insert-last-word
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
With a numeric argument, or when passed command line arguments in a
call from another widget, it behaves like *insert-last-word*/, except
that/ words in comments are ignored when *INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS*/ is
set./</p>
<p>
Otherwise, the rightmost ``interesting&#39;&#39; word from the previous
command is found and inserted. The default definition of
``interesting&#39;&#39; is that the word contains at least one alphabetic
character, slash, or backslash. This definition may be overridden by
use of the *match*/ style. The/ context used to look up the style is
the widget name, so usually the context is *:insert-last-word*/.
However, you can bind this function to/ different widgets to use
different patterns:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zle -N insert-last-assignment smart-insert-last-word
zstyle :insert-last-assignment match &#39;[[:alpha:]][][[:alnum:]]#=*&#39;
bindkey &#39;\e=&#39; insert-last-assignment
</pre>

If no interesting word is found and the *auto-previous*/ style is set
to/ a true value, the search continues upward through the history.
When *auto-previous*/ is unset or false (the default), the widget must
be/ invoked repeatedly in order to search earlier history lines.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>transpose-lines</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Only useful with a multi-line editing buffer; the
lines here are lines within the current on-screen buffer, not history
lines. The effect is similar to the function of the same name in
Emacs.

Transpose the current line with the previous line and move the cursor
to the start of the next line. Repeating this (which can be done by
providing a positive numeric argument) has the effect of moving the
line above the cursor down by a number of lines.

With a negative numeric argument, requires two lines above the cursor.
These two lines are transposed and the cursor moved to the start of
the previous line. Using a numeric argument less than -1 has the
effect of moving the line above the cursor up by minus that number of
lines.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>url-quote-magic</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This widget replaces the built-in *self-insert*/
to make it easier to/ type URLs as command line arguments. As you
type, the input character is analyzed and, if it may need quoting, the
current word is checked for a URI scheme. If one is found and the
current word is not already in quotes, a backslash is inserted before
the input character.</p>
<p>
Styles to control quoting behavior:</p>
<p>
<strong>url-metas</strong> This style is looked up in the context
`*:url-quote-magic:*/scheme&#39;/ (where <em>scheme is that of the current
URL, e.g. &#34;/*ftp*</em>&#34;). The value/ is a string listing the characters to
be treated as globbing metacharacters when appearing in a URL using
that scheme. The default is to quote all zsh extended globbing
characters, excluding &#39;*&lt;*/&#39; and/ &#39;*&gt;*/&#39; but including braces (as in
brace expansion). See also/ *url-seps*/./</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>url-seps</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Like *url-metas*/, but lists characters that should be
considered command/ separators, redirections, history references,
etc. The default is to quote the standard set of shell separators,
excluding those that overlap with the extended globbing characters,
but including &#39;*&lt;*/&#39; and/ &#39;*&gt;*/&#39; and the first character of
<em><strong>$histchars</strong></em>./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>url-globbers</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This style is looked up in the context
`*:url-quote-magic*/&#39;. The values/ form a list of command names that
are expected to do their own globbing on the URL string. This
implies that they are aliased to use the `*noglob*/&#39; modifier. When
the first word on the line matches one of the/ values <em>and the URL
refers to a local file (see /*url-local-schema*</em>),/ only the
*url-seps*/ characters are quoted; the <em><strong>url-metas</strong></em> are left/
alone, allowing them to affect command-line parsing, completion,
etc. The default values are a literal `*noglob*/&#39; plus (when the
<em><strong>zsh/parameter</strong> module is available) any commands aliased to the
helper function `*urlglobber*</em>&#39; or its alias `/*globurl*/&#39;./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>url-local-schema</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This style is always looked up in the context
`*:urlglobber*/&#39;, even/ though it is used by both url-quote-magic
and urlglobber. The values form a list of URI schema that should be
treated as referring to local files by their real local path names,
as opposed to files which are specified relative to a
web-server-defined document root. The defaults are &#34;*ftp*/&#34; and
&#34;<em><strong>file</strong></em>&#34;./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>url-other-schema</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Like *url-local-schema*/, but lists all other
URI schema upon which/ *urlglobber*/ and <em><strong>url-quote-magic</strong></em> should
act. If the URI on the/ command line does not have a scheme
appearing either in this list or in *url-local-schema*/, it is not
magically quoted. The default values are/ &#34;*http*/&#34;, &#34;<em><strong>https</strong></em>&#34;,
and &#34;<em><strong>ftp</strong></em>&#34;. When a scheme appears both here/ and in
*url-local-schema*/, it is quoted differently depending on whether/
the command name appears in *url-globbers*/./</dd>
</dl>
<p>Loading *url-quote-magic*/ also defines a helper function
`/*urlglobber*/&#39;/ and aliases `*globurl*/&#39; to `/*noglob urlglobber*/&#39;.
This function takes/ a local URL apart, attempts to pattern-match the
local file portion of the URL path, and then puts the results back
into URL format again.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>vi-pipe</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This function reads a movement command from the keyboard
and then prompts for an external command. The part of the buffer
covered by the movement is piped to the external command and then
replaced by the command&#39;s output. If the movement command is bound to
vi-pipe, the current line is used.

The function serves as an example for reading a vi movement command
from within a user-defined widget.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>which-command</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This function is a drop-in replacement for the
builtin widget *which-command*/. It has enhanced behaviour, in that it
correctly/ detects whether or not the command word needs to be
expanded as an alias; if so, it continues tracing the command word
from the expanded alias until it reaches the command that will be
executed.

The style <strong>whence*/ is available in the context /</strong>:zle:$WIDGET*/;
this/ may be set to an array to give the command and options that will
be used to investigate the command word found. The default is *whence
-c*/./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>zcalc-auto-insert</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This function is useful together with the
*zcalc*/ function described in/ the section `Mathematical Functions&#39;.
It should be bound to a key representing a binary operator such as
`*+*/&#39;, `/*-*/&#39;, `/***/&#39; or `/*/*/&#39;. When running in zcalc,/ if the
key occurs at the start of the line or immediately following an open
parenthesis, the text *&#34;ans &#34;*/ is inserted before the/ representation
of the key itself. This allows easy use of the answer from the
previous calculation in the current line. The text to be inserted
before the symbol typed can be modified by setting the variable
*ZCALC_AUTO_INSERT_PREFIX*/./

Hence, for example, typing `*+12*/&#39; followed by return adds 12/ to the
previous result.

If zcalc is in RPN mode (*-r*/ option) the effect of this binding is/
automatically suppressed as operators alone on a line are meaningful.

When not in zcalc, the key simply inserts the symbol itself.</dd>

Utility Functions

<p>These functions are useful in constructing widgets. They should be
loaded with `*autoload -U*/ function&#39; and called/ as indicated from
user-defined widgets.</p>
<p>
<strong>split-shell-arguments</strong> This function splits the line currently being
edited into shell arguments and whitespace. The result is stored in the
array *reply*/. The array/ contains all the parts of the line in order,
starting with any whitespace before the first argument, and finishing
with any whitespace after the last argument. Hence (so long as the
option *KSH_ARRAYS*/ is not set)/ whitespace is given by odd indices in
the array and arguments by even indices. Note that no stripping of
quotes is done; joining together all the elements of *reply*/ in order
is guaranteed to produce the/ original line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The parameter *REPLY*/ is set to the index of the word in <em><strong>reply</strong></em>
which/ contains the character after the cursor, where the first element
has index 1. The parameter *REPLY2*/ is set to the index of the
character under the/ cursor in that word, where the first character has
index 1.</p>
<p>
Hence *reply*/, <em><strong>REPLY</strong></em> and <em><strong>REPLY2</strong></em> should all be made local to/
the enclosing function.</p>
<p>
See the function *modify-current-argument*/, described below, for/ an
example of how to call this function.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
*modify-current-argument*/ [ expr-using-<em><strong>$ARG</strong></em> | func ]/
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This
function provides a simple method of allowing user-defined widgets to
modify the command line argument under the cursor (or immediately to
the left of the cursor if the cursor is between arguments).</p>
<p>
The argument can be an expression which when evaluated operates on the
shell parameter *ARG*/, which will have been set to the command line
argument/ under the cursor. The expression should be suitably quoted
to prevent it being evaluated too early.</p>
<p>
Alternatively, if the argument does not contain the string *ARG*/, it/
is assumed to be a shell function, to which the current command line
argument is passed as the only argument. The function should set the
variable *REPLY*/ to the new value for the command line argument./ If
the function returns non-zero status, so does the calling function.</p>
<p>
For example, a user-defined widget containing the following code
converts the characters in the argument under the cursor into all
upper case:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
modify-current-argument &#39;${(U)ARG}&#39;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The following strips any quoting from the current word (whether
backslashes or one of the styles of quotes), and replaces it with
single quoting throughout:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
modify-current-argument &#39;${(qq)${(Q)ARG}}&#39;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The following performs directory expansion on the command line
argument and replaces it by the absolute path:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
expand-dir() {
  REPLY=${~1}
  REPLY=${REPLY:a}
}
modify-current-argument expand-dir

In practice the function *expand-dir*/ would probably not be defined/

Styles

<p>The behavior of several of the above widgets can be controlled by the
use of the *zstyle*/ mechanism. In particular, widgets that interact
with/ the completion system pass along their context to any completions
that they invoke.</p>
<p>
<strong>break-keys</strong> This style is used by the *incremental-complete-word*/
widget. Its value/ should be a pattern, and all keys matching this
pattern will cause the widget to stop incremental completion without the
key having any further effect. Like all styles used directly by
<strong>incremental-complete-word*/, this style is looked up using the/ context

<dl>
<dt>
<strong>completer</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The *incremental-complete-word*/ and
<em><strong>insert-and-predict</strong></em> widgets set/ up their top-level context name
before calling completion. This allows one to define different sets of
completer functions for normal completion and for these widgets. For
example, to use completion, approximation and correction for normal
completion, completion and correction for incremental completion and
only completion for prediction one could use:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:completion:*&#39; completer \ 
        _complete _correct _approximate
zstyle &#39;:completion:incremental:*&#39; completer \ 
        _complete _correct
zstyle &#39;:completion:predict:*&#39; completer \ 
        _complete
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is a good idea to restrict the completers used in prediction,
because they may be automatically invoked as you type. The *_list*/
and/ *_menu*/ completers should never be used with prediction. The/
*_approximate*/, <em><strong>_correct</strong></em>, <em><strong>_expand</strong></em>, and <em><strong>_match</strong></em> completers
may/ be used, but be aware that they may change characters anywhere in
the word behind the cursor, so you need to watch carefully that the
result is what you intended.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>cursor</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>insert-and-predict*/ widget uses this style, in the
context/ `</strong>:predict*/&#39;, to decide where to place the cursor after

<p>
<strong>complete</strong> The cursor is left where it was when completion finished,
but only if it is after a character equal to the one just inserted by
the user. If it is after another character, this value is the same as
`*key*/&#39;./</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>key</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The cursor is left after the <em>nth occurrence of the

just typed even if the completion code found out that no other

However, you might want to include words that contain spaces:</p>

EXCEPTION HANDLING
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-40" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Two functions are provided to enable zsh to provide exception handling
in a form that should be familiar from other languages.</p>
<p>
*throw*/ exception/ The function *throw*/ throws the named exception.
The name is/ an arbitrary string and is only used by the <strong>throw*/ and
/*catch</strong> functions. An exception is for the most part treated the same
as a shell error, i.e. an unhandled exception will cause the shell to
abort all processing in a function or script and to return to the top
level in an interactive shell.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
*catch*/ exception-pattern/
</dt>
<dd>The function *catch*/ returns status
zero if an exception was thrown and/ the pattern <em>exception-pattern
matches its name. Otherwise it</em> returns status 1. <em>exception-pattern
is a standard</em> shell pattern, respecting the current setting of the
<strong>EXTENDED_GLOB</strong> option. An alias *catch*/ is also defined to prevent
the argument to the/ function from matching filenames, so patterns may
be used unquoted. Note that as exceptions are not fundamentally
different from other shell errors it is possible to catch shell errors
by using an empty string as the exception name. The shell variable
*CAUGHT*/ is set by <em><strong>catch</strong></em> to the/ name of the exception caught. It
is possible to rethrow an exception by calling the *throw*/ function
again once an exception has been caught./</dd>
</dl>
<p>The functions are designed to be used together with the *always*/
construct/ described in <em>zshmisc(1). This is important as only this</em>
construct provides the required support for exceptions. A typical
example is as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
{
  # &#34;try&#34; block
  # ... nested code here calls &#34;throw MyExcept&#34;
} always {
  # &#34;always&#34; block
  if catch MyExcept; then
    print &#34;Caught exception MyExcept&#34;
  elif catch &#39;&#39;; then
    print &#34;Caught a shell error.  Propagating...&#34;
    throw &#39;&#39;
  fi
  # Other exceptions are not handled but may be caught further
  # up the call stack.
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If all exceptions should be caught, the following idiom might be
preferable.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
{
  # ... nested code here throws an exception
} always {
  if catch *; then
    case $CAUGHT in
      (MyExcept)
      print &#34;Caught my own exception&#34;
      ;;
      (*)
      print &#34;Caught some other exception&#34;
      ;;
    esac
  fi
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In common with exception handling in other languages, the exception may
be thrown by code deeply nested inside the `try&#39; block. However, note
that it must be thrown inside the current shell, not in a subshell
forked for a pipeline, parenthesised current-shell construct, or some
form of command or process substitution.</p>
<p>
The system internally uses the shell variable *EXCEPTION*/ to record
the/ name of the exception between throwing and catching. One drawback
of this scheme is that if the exception is not handled the variable
<strong>EXCEPTION</strong> remains set and may be incorrectly recognised as the name of
an exception if a shell error subsequently occurs. Adding *unset
EXCEPTION*/ at the/ start of the outermost layer of any code that uses
exception handling will eliminate this problem.</p>

MIME FUNCTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-41" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Three functions are available to provide handling of files recognised by
extension, for example to dispatch a file *text.ps*/ when executed as a/
command to an appropriate viewer.</p>
<p>
<strong>zsh-mime-setup*/ [ /</strong>-fv*/ ] [ <em><strong>-l</strong></em> [ suffix … ] ]/</p>
<p>
<strong>zsh-mime-handler*/ [ /</strong>-l*/ ] command argument …/ These two functions
use the files *~/.mime.types*/ and <em><strong>/etc/mime.types</strong></em>,/ which associate
types and extensions, as well as *~/.mailcap*/ and/ */etc/mailcap*/
files, which associate types and the programs that/ handle them. These
are provided on many systems with the Multimedia Internet Mail
Extensions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To enable the system, the function *zsh-mime-setup*/ should be/
autoloaded and run. This allows files with extensions to be treated as
executable; such files be completed by the function completion system.
The function *zsh-mime-handler*/ should not need to be called by the/
user.</p>
<p>
The system works by setting up suffix aliases with `*alias -s*/&#39;./
Suffix aliases already installed by the user will not be overwritten.</p>
<p>
For suffixes defined in lower case, upper case variants will also
automatically be handled (e.g. *PDF*/ is automatically handled if/
handling for the suffix *pdf*/ is defined), but not vice versa./</p>
<p>
Repeated calls to <strong>zsh-mime-setup*/ do not override the existing/
mapping between suffixes and executable files unless the option *-f</strong> is
given. Note, however, that this does not override existing suffix
aliases assigned to handlers other than *zsh-mime-handler*/./</p>
<p>
Calling <strong>zsh-mime-setup*/ with the option /</strong>-l*/ lists the existing/
mappings without altering them. Suffixes to list (which may contain
pattern characters that should be quoted from immediate interpretation
on the command line) may be given as additional arguments, otherwise all
suffixes are listed.</p>
<p>
Calling *zsh-mime-setup*/ with the option/ *-v*/ causes verbose output
to be shown during the setup operation./</p>
<p>
The system respects the *mailcap*/ flags <em><strong>needsterminal</strong></em> and/
*copiousoutput*/; see mailcap(4) or mailcap(5)/ (the man page&#39;s name
varies across platforms).</p>
<p>
The functions use the following styles, which are defined with the
*zstyle*/ builtin command (see zshmodules(1)). They should be defined/
before *zsh-mime-setup*/ is run. The contexts used all/ start with
*:mime:*/, with additional components in some cases./ It is recommended
that a trailing ***/ (suitably quoted) be appended/ to style patterns in
case the system is extended in future. Some examples are given below.</p>
<p>
For files that have multiple suffixes, e.g. *.pdf.gz*/, where the/
context includes the suffix it will be looked up starting with the
longest possible suffix until a match for the style is found. For
example, if *.pdf.gz*/ produces a match for the handler, that/ will be
used; otherwise the handler for *.gz*/ will be used. Note/ that, owing
to the way suffix aliases work, it is always required that there be a
handler for the shortest possible suffix, so in this example <strong>.pdf.gz*/
can only be handled if /</strong>.gz*/ is also handled (though/ not necessarily
in the same way). Alternatively, if no handling for *.gz*/ on its own is
needed, simply adding the command/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
alias -s gz=zsh-mime-handler
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
to the initialisation code is sufficient; *.gz*/ will not be handled/ on
its own, but may be in combination with other suffixes.</p>
<p>
<strong>current-shell</strong> If this boolean style is true, the mailcap handler for
the context in question is run using the *eval*/ builtin instead of by
starting a new/ *sh*/ process. This is more efficient, but may not work
in the occasional/ cases where the mailcap handler uses strict POSIX
syntax.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>disown</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If this boolean style is true, mailcap handlers started in
the background will be disowned, i.e. not subject to job control
within the parent shell. Such handlers nearly always produce their own
windows, so the only likely harmful side effect of setting the style
is that it becomes harder to kill jobs from within the shell.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>execute-as-is</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This style gives a list of patterns to be matched
against files passed for execution with a handler program. If the file
matches the pattern, the entire command line is executed in its
current form, with no handler. This is useful for files which might
have suffixes but nonetheless be executable in their own right. If the
style is not set, the pattern <strong>*(</strong>) *(<em>)*</em> is used;/ hence executable
files are executed directly and not passed to a handler, and the
option *AUTO_CD*/ may be used to change to directories/ that happen to
have MIME suffixes.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>execute-never</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This style is useful in combination with
*execute-as-is*/. It is/ set to an array of patterns corresponding to
full paths to files that should never be treated as executable, even
if the file passed to the MIME handler matches *execute-as-is*/. This
is useful for file/ systems that don&#39;t handle execute permission or
that contain executables from another operating system. For example,
if */mnt/windows*/ is a/ Windows mount, then</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:mime:*&#39; execute-never &#39;/mnt/windows/*&#39;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
will ensure that any files found in that area will be executed as MIME
types even if they are executable. As this example shows, the complete
file name is matched against the pattern, regardless of how the file
was passed to the handler. The file is resolved to a full path using
the *:P*/ modifier described in/ the subsection `Modifiers&#39; in
<em>zshexpn(1);</em> this means that symbolic links are resolved where
possible, so that links into other file systems behave in the correct
fashion.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>file-path</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Used if the style *find-file-in-path*/ is true for the
same context./ Set to an array of directories that are used for
searching for the file to be handled; the default is the command path
given by the special parameter *path*/. The shell option <em><strong>PATH_DIRS</strong></em>
is respected;/ if that is set, the appropriate path will be searched
even if the name of the file to be handled as it appears on the

<strong>:mime:.*/suffix/</strong>:*/, as described for the style/ *handler*/./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>find-file-in-path</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set, allows files whose names do not contain
absolute paths to be searched for in the command path or the path
specified by the *file-path*/ style. If the file is not found in the
path, it is looked/ for locally (whether or not the current directory
is in the path); if it is not found locally, the handler will abort
unless the <strong>handle-nonexistent</strong> style is set. Files found in the path
are tested as described for the style <strong>execute-as-is*/./ The full
context is *:mime:.*/suffix/</strong>:*/, as described for the style/
*handler*/./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>flags</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Defines flags to go with a handler; the context is as for

<em><strong>mailcap</strong></em>./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>handle-nonexistent</strong>
</dt>
<dd>By default, arguments that don&#39;t correspond to
files are not passed to the MIME handler in order to prevent it from
intercepting commands found in the path that happen to have suffixes.
This style may be set to an array of extended glob patterns for
arguments that will be passed to the handler even if they don&#39;t exist.
If it is not explicitly set it defaults to *<a href=":alpha:">:alpha:</a>#:/**/ which
allows URLs to be passed to the MIME/ handler even though they don&#39;t
exist in that format in the file system. The full context is
<strong>:mime:.*/suffix/</strong>:*/, as described for the style/ *handler*/./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>handler</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a handler for a suffix; the suffix is given by
the context as <strong>:mime:.*/suffix/</strong>:*/, and the format of the handler is
exactly/ that in <strong>mailcap*/. Note in particular the `/</strong>.*/&#39; and
trailing colon/ to distinguish this use of the context. This overrides
any handler specified by the *mailcap*/ files. If the handler requires
a terminal,/ the *flags*/ style should be set to include the word
<em><strong>needsterminal</strong></em>,/ or if the output is to be displayed through a
pager (but not if the handler is itself a pager), it should include
*copiousoutput*/./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>mailcap</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A list of files in the format of *~/.mailcap*/ and/
*/etc/mailcap*/ to be read during setup, replacing the default list/
which consists of those two files. The context is *:mime:*/./ A *+*/
in the list will be replaced by the default files./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>mailcap-priorities</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This style is used to resolve multiple mailcap
entries for the same MIME type. It consists of an array of the
following elements, in descending order of priority; later entries
will be used if earlier entries are unable to resolve the entries
being compared. If none of the tests resolve the entries, the first
entry encountered is retained.</p>
<p>
<strong>files</strong> The order of files (entries in the *mailcap*/ style) read.
Earlier/ files are preferred. (Note this does not resolve entries in
the same file.)</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>priority</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The priority flag from the mailcap entry. The priority
is an integer from 0 to 9 with the default value being 5.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>flags</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The test given by the *mailcap-prio-flags*/ option is
used to resolve/ entries.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>place</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Later entries are preferred; as the entries are strictly
ordered, this test always succeeds.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that as this style is handled during initialisation, the context
is always *:mime:*/, with no discrimination by suffix./</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>mailcap-prio-flags</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This style is used when the keyword *flags*/
is encountered in the/ list of tests specified by the
*mailcap-priorities*/ style./ It should be set to a list of patterns,
each of which is tested against the flags specified in the mailcap
entry (in other words, the sets of assignments found with some entries
in the mailcap file). Earlier patterns in the list are preferred to
later ones, and matched patterns are preferred to unmatched ones.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>mime-types</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A list of files in the format of *~/.mime.types*/ and/
*/etc/mime.types*/ to be read during setup, replacing the default
list/ which consists of those two files. The context is *:mime:*/./ A
*+*/ in the list will be replaced by the default files./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>never-background</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If this boolean style is set, the handler for
the given context is always run in the foreground, even if the flags
provided in the mailcap entry suggest it need not be (for example, it
doesn&#39;t require a terminal).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>pager</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set, will be used instead of *$PAGER*/ or <em><strong>more</strong></em> to
handle/ suffixes where the <strong>copiousoutput*/ flag is set. The context
is/ as for *handler*/, i.e. /</strong>:mime:.*/suffix/*:*/ for handling/ a
file with the given <em>suffix.</em></dd>
</dl>
<p>Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:mime:*&#39; mailcap ~/.mailcap /usr/local/etc/mailcap
zstyle &#39;:mime:.txt:&#39; handler less %s
zstyle &#39;:mime:.txt:&#39; flags needsterminal
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
When <strong>zsh-mime-setup*/ is subsequently run, it will look for/ *mailcap*/
entries in the two files given. Files of suffix /</strong>.txt* will be handled
by running `*less*/ file.txt&#39;. The flag/ *needsterminal*/ is set to show
that this program must run attached to a/ terminal.</p>
<p>
As there are several steps to dispatching a command, the following
should be checked if attempting to execute a file by extension *.*/ext
does not have the expected effect./</p>
<p>
The command `*alias -s*/ ext&#39; should show/ `*ps=zsh-mime-handler*/&#39;. If
it shows something else, another suffix/ alias was already installed and
was not overwritten. If it shows nothing, no handler was installed: this
is most likely because no handler was found in the *.mime.types*/ and
<em><strong>mailcap</strong></em> combination for/ *.ext*/ files. In that case, appropriate
handling should be added to/ *~/.mime.types*/ and <em><strong>mailcap</strong></em>./</p>
<p>
If the extension is handled by *zsh-mime-handler*/ but the file is/ not
opened correctly, either the handler defined for the type is incorrect,
or the flags associated with it are in appropriate. Running
*zsh-mime-setup -l*/ will show the handler and, if there are any, the/
flags. A *%s*/ in the handler is replaced by the file (suitably quoted/
if necessary). Check that the handler program listed lists and can be
run in the way shown. Also check that the flags *needsterminal*/ or/
*copiousoutput*/ are set if the handler needs to be run under a/
terminal; the second flag is used if the output should be sent to a
pager. An example of a suitable *mailcap*/ entry for such a program is:/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
text/html; /usr/bin/lynx &#39;%s&#39;; needsterminal
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Running `*zsh-mime-handler -l*/ command line&#39; prints the command/ line
that would be executed, simplified to remove the effect of any flags,
and quoted so that the output can be run as a complete zsh command line.
This is used by the completion system to decide how to complete after a
file handled by *zsh-mime-setup*/./</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<strong>pick-web-browser</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This function is separate from the two MIME
functions described above and can be assigned directly to a suffix:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
autoload -U pick-web-browser
alias -s html=pick-web-browser
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is provided as an intelligent front end to dispatch a web browser.
It may be run as either a function or a shell script. The status 255
is returned if no browser could be started.</p>
<p>
Various styles are available to customize the choice of browsers:</p>
<p>
<strong>browser-style</strong> The value of the style is an array giving preferences
in decreasing order for the type of browser to use. The values of
elements may be</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>running</strong> Use a GUI browser that is already running when an X Window
display is available. The browsers listed in the *x-browsers*/ style
are tried/ in order until one is found; if it is, the file will be
displayed in that browser, so the user may need to check whether it
has appeared. If no running browser is found, one is not started.
Browsers other than Firefox, Opera and Konqueror are assumed to
understand the Mozilla syntax for opening a URL remotely.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>x</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Start a new GUI browser when an X Window display is
available. Search for the availability of one of the browsers listed
in the *x-browsers*/ style/ and start the first one that is found.
No check is made for an already running browser.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>tty</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Start a terminal-based browser. Search for the availability
of one of the browsers listed in the *tty-browsers*/ style and start
the/ first one that is found.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the style is not set the default *running x tty*/ is used./</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>x-browsers</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>An array in decreasing order of preference of
browsers to use when running under the X Window System. The array
consists of the command name under which to start the browser. They
are looked up in the context *:mime:*/ (which may/ be extended in
future, so appending `***/&#39; is recommended). For/ example,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zstyle &#39;:mime:*&#39; x-browsers opera konqueror firefox
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
specifies that *pick-web-browser*/ should first look for a running/
instance of Opera, Konqueror or Firefox, in that order, and if it
fails to find any should attempt to start Opera. The default is
*firefox mozilla netscape opera konqueror*/./</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>tty-browsers</strong>
</dt>
<dd>An array similar to *x-browsers*/, except that it
gives browsers to/ use when no X Window display is available. The
default is *elinks links lynx*/./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>command</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If it is set this style is used to pick the command
used to open a page for a browser. The context is
*:mime:browser:new:$browser:*/ to start a new browser or/
*:mime:browser:running:$browser:*/ to open a URL in a browser
already/ running on the current X display, where *$browser*/ is the
value matched/ in the *x-browsers*/ or <em><strong>tty-browsers</strong></em> style. The
escape sequence/ <strong>%b*/ in the style&#39;s value will be replaced by the
browser, while /*%u</strong> will be replaced by the URL. If the style is
not set, the default for all new instances is equivalent to *%b %u*/
and the defaults for using running/ browsers are equivalent to the
values <strong>kfmclient openURL %u*/ for/ Konqueror, *firefox -new-tab
%u*/ for Firefox, /*opera -newpage %u</strong> for Opera, and *%b -remote
&#34;openUrl(%u)&#34;*/ for all others./</dd>

MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-42" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>zcalc*/ [ /</strong>-erf*/ ] [ expression … ]/ A reasonably powerful
calculator based on zsh&#39;s arithmetic evaluation facility. The syntax is
similar to that of formulae in most programming languages; see the
section `Arithmetic Evaluation&#39; in <em>zshmisc(1) for details.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Non-programmers should note that, as in many other programming
languages, expressions involving only integers (whether constants
without a `*.*/&#39;, variables containing such constants as strings, or/
variables declared to be integers) are by default evaluated using
integer arithmetic, which is not how an ordinary desk calculator
operates. To force floating point operation, pass the option *-f*/;/ see
further notes below.</p>
<p>
If the file *~/.zcalcrc*/ exists it will be sourced inside the function/
once it is set up and about to process the command line. This can be
used, for example, to set shell options; <strong>emulate -L zsh</strong> and *setopt
extendedglob*/ are in effect at this point. Any/ failure to source the
file if it exists is treated as fatal. As with other initialisation
files, the directory *$ZDOTDIR*/ is used/ instead of *$HOME*/ if it is
set./</p>
<p>
The mathematical library *zsh/mathfunc*/ will be loaded if it is/
available; see the section `The zsh/mathfunc Module&#39; in <em>zshmodules(1).
The mathematical functions</em> correspond to the raw system libraries, so
trigonometric functions are evaluated using radians, and so on.</p>
<p>
Each line typed is evaluated as an expression. The prompt shows a
number, which corresponds to a positional parameter where the result of
that calculation is stored. For example, the result of the calculation
on the line preceded by `*4&gt; */&#39; is available as <em><strong>$4</strong></em>. The last value/
calculated is available as *ans*/. Full command line editing, including/
the history of previous calculations, is available; the history is saved
in the file <strong>~/.zcalc_history*/. To exit, enter a blank line or type
`/</strong>:q*/&#39;/ on its own (`*q*/&#39; is allowed for historical compatibility)./</p>
<p>
A line ending with a single backslash is treated in the same fashion as
it is in command line editing: the backslash is removed, the function
prompts for more input (the prompt is preceded by `*…*/&#39;/ to indicate
this), and the lines are combined into one to get the final result. In
addition, if the input so far contains more open than close parentheses
*zcalc*/ will prompt for more input./</p>
<p>
If arguments are given to *zcalc*/ on start up, they are used to prime
the/ first few positional parameters. A visual indication of this is
given when the calculator starts.</p>
<p>
The constants *PI*/ (3.14159…) and <em><strong>E</strong></em> (2.71828…) are provided./
Parameter assignment is possible, but note that all parameters will be
put into the global namespace unless the *:local*/ special command is/
used. The function creates local variables whose names start with *_*/,
so users should avoid doing so. The variables <em><strong>ans</strong></em> (the last/ answer)
and *stack*/ (the stack in RPN mode) may be referred to/ directly;
*stack*/ is an array but elements of it are numeric. Various/ other
special variables are used locally with their standard meaning, for
example *compcontext*/, <em><strong>match</strong></em>, <em><strong>mbegin</strong></em>, <em><strong>mend</strong></em>, <em><strong>psvar</strong></em>./</p>
<p>
The output base can be initialised by passing the option `*-#*/base&#39;,/
for example `*zcalc -#16*/&#39; (the `/*#*/&#39; may have to be quoted,
depending/ on the globbing options set).</p>
<p>
If the option `*-e*/&#39; is set, the function runs non-interactively:/ the
arguments are treated as expressions to be evaluated as if entered
interactively line by line.</p>
<p>
If the option `*-f*/&#39; is set, all numbers are treated as floating/
point, hence for example the expression `*3/4*/&#39; evaluates to 0.75/
rather than 0. Options must appear in separate words.</p>
<p>
If the option `*-r*/&#39; is set, RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) mode is/
entered. This has various additional properties:</p>
<p>
Stack Evaluated values are maintained in a stack; this is contained in
an array named *stack*/ with the most recent value in <em><strong>${stack[1]}</strong></em>./</p>
<dl>
<dt>
Operators and functions
</dt>
<dd>If the line entered matches an operator
(<strong>+*/, /</strong>-*/, <em><strong>*</strong></em>,/ */*/, <em><strong>**</strong></em>, <em><strong>^</strong></em>, <em><strong>|</strong></em> or <em><strong>&amp;</strong></em>) or a
function supplied by the/ *zsh/mathfunc*/ library, the bottom element
or elements of the stack/ are popped to use as the argument or
arguments. The higher elements of stack (least recent) are used as
earlier arguments. The result is then pushed into *${stack[1]}*/./</dd>
<dt>
Expressions
</dt>
<dd>Other expressions are evaluated normally, printed, and
added to the stack as numeric values. The syntax within expressions on
a single line is normal shell arithmetic (not RPN).</dd>
<dt>
Stack listing
</dt>
<dd>If an integer follows the option *-r*/ with no space,
then/ on every evaluation that many elements of the stack, where
available, are printed instead of just the most recent result. Hence,
for example, *zcalc -r4*/ shows <em><strong>$stack[4]</strong></em> to <em><strong>$stack[1]</strong></em> each
time results/ are printed.</dd>
<dt>
Duplication: <strong>=</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The pseudo-operator *=*/ causes the most recent
element of/ the stack to be duplicated onto the stack.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>pop</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The pseudo-function *pop*/ causes the most recent element of/
the stack to be popped. A `*&gt;*/&#39; on its own has the same effect./</dd>
<dt>
*&gt;*/ident/
</dt>
<dd>The expression *&gt;*/ followed (with no space) by a shell
identifier/ causes the most recent element of the stack to be popped
and assigned to the variable with that name. The variable is local to
the *zcalc*/ function./</dd>
<dt>
*&lt;*/ident/
</dt>
<dd>The expression *&lt;*/ followed (with no space) by a shell
identifier/ causes the value of the variable with that name to be
pushed onto the stack. <em>ident may be an integer, in which</em> case the
previous result with that number (as shown before the *&gt;*/ in the
standard <em><strong>zcalc</strong></em> prompt) is put on the stack./</dd>
<dt>
Exchange: <strong>xy</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The pseudo-function *xy*/ causes the most recent two
elements of/ the stack to be exchanged. `*&lt;&gt;*/&#39; has the same effect./</dd>
</dl>
<p>The prompt is configurable via the parameter *ZCALCPROMPT*/, which/
undergoes standard prompt expansion. The index of the current entry is
stored locally in the first element of the array *psvar*/, which can be/
referred to in *ZCALCPROMPT*/ as `/*%1v*/&#39;. The default prompt is/
`*%1v&gt; */&#39;./</p>
<p>
The variable *ZCALC_ACTIVE*/ is set within the function and can/ be
tested by nested functions; it has the value *rpn*/ if RPN mode is/
active, else 1.</p>
<p>
A few special commands are available; these are introduced by a colon.
For backward compatibility, the colon may be omitted for certain
commands. Completion is available if *compinit*/ has been run./</p>
<p>
The output precision may be specified within zcalc by special commands
familiar from many calculators.</p>
<p>
<strong>:norm</strong> The default output format. It corresponds to the printf <strong>%g</strong>
specification. Typically this shows six decimal digits.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
*:sci*/ digits/
</dt>
<dd>Scientific notation, corresponding to the printf
*%g*/ output format with/ the precision given by <em>digits. This
produces either fixed point or</em> exponential notation depending on the
value output.</dd>
<dt>
*:fix*/ digits/
</dt>
<dd>Fixed point notation, corresponding to the printf
*%f*/ output format with/ the precision given by <em>digits.</em></dd>
<dt>
*:eng*/ digits/
</dt>
<dd>Exponential notation, corresponding to the printf
*%E*/ output format with/ the precision given by <em>digits.</em></dd>
<dt>
<strong>:raw</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Raw output: this is the default form of the output from a
math evaluation. This may show more precision than the number actually

it</em> is executed in the context of the function, i.e. with local
variables. Space is optional after *:!*/./</p>
<dl>
<dt>
*:local*/ arg …/
</dt>
<dd>Declare variables local to the function. Other
variables may be used, too, but they will be taken from or put into

below./</p>
<p>
Note that *zcalc*/ takes care of all quoting. Hence for example:/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
:f cube $1 * $1 * $1
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
defines a function to cube the sole argument. Functions so defined, or
indeed any functions defined directly or indirectly using <strong>functions</strong>
-M/, are available to execute by typing only the name on the line in
RPN/ mode; this pops the appropriate number of arguments off the stack
to pass to the function, i.e. 1 in the case of the example <strong>cube</strong>
function. If there are optional arguments only the mandatory arguments
are supplied by this means.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>[#*/base/*]</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is not a special command, rather part of normal
arithmetic syntax; however, when this form appears on a line by itself
the default output radix is set to <em>base. Use, for example,
`/*[#16]*</em>&#39; to display/ hexadecimal output preceded by an indication
of the base, or `*[##16]*/&#39;/ just to display the raw number in the
given base. Bases themselves are always specified in decimal. `*[#]*/&#39;
restores the normal output format./ Note that setting an output base
suppresses floating point output; use `*[#]*/&#39; to return to normal
operation./</dd>
<dt>
*$*/var/
</dt>
<dd>Print out the value of var literally; does not affect the
calculation. To use the value of var, omit the leading `*$*/&#39;./</dd>

*zmathfuncdef*/ [ mathfunc [ body ] ]/
</dt>
<dd>A convenient front end to
*functions -M*/./

With two arguments, define a mathematical function named <em>mathfunc</em>
which can be used in any form of arithmetic evaluation. <em>body</em> is a
mathematical expression to implement the function. It may contain
references to position parameters <strong>$1*/, /*$2*/, …/ to refer to
mandatory parameters and *${1:-*/defvalue/</strong>}*/ …/ to refer to
optional parameters. Note that the forms must be strictly adhered to
for the function to calculate the correct number of arguments. The
implementation is held in a shell function named
*zsh_math_func_*/mathfunc; usually the user will not need/ to refer to
the shell function directly. Any existing function of the same name is
silently replaced.

With one argument, remove the mathematical function <em>mathfunc</em> as well
as the shell function implementation.

With no arguments, list all <em>mathfunc functions in a form</em> suitable

USER CONFIGURATION FUNCTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-43" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The *zsh/newuser*/ module comes with a function to aid in configuring/
shell options for new users. If the module is installed, this function
can also be run by hand. It is available even if the module&#39;s default
behaviour, namely running the function for a new user logging in without
startup files, is inhibited.</p>
<p>
<strong>zsh-newuser-install*/ [ /</strong>-f*/ ]/ The function presents the user with
various options for customizing their initialization scripts. Currently
only *~/.zshrc*/ is handled./ *$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc*/ is used instead if the
parameter <em><strong>ZDOTDIR</strong></em> is/ set; this provides a way for the user to
configure a file without altering an existing *.zshrc*/./</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default the function exits immediately if it finds any of the files
<strong>.zshenv*/, /</strong>.zprofile*/, <em><strong>.zshrc</strong></em>, or <em><strong>.zlogin</strong></em> in the
appropriate/ directory. The option *-f*/ is required in order to force
the function/ to continue. Note this may happen even if *.zshrc*/ itself
does not/ exist.</p>
<p>
As currently configured, the function will exit immediately if the user
has root privileges; this behaviour cannot be overridden.</p>
<p>
Once activated, the function&#39;s behaviour is supposed to be
self-explanatory. Menus are present allowing the user to alter the value
of options and parameters. Suggestions for improvements are always
welcome.</p>
<p>
When the script exits, the user is given the opportunity to save the new
file or not; changes are not irreversible until this point. However, the
script is careful to restrict changes to the file only to a group marked
by the lines `*# Lines configured by zsh-newuser-install*/&#39; and/ `*# End
of lines configured by zsh-newuser-install*/&#39;. In addition,/ the old
version of *.zshrc*/ is saved to a file with the suffix/ *.zni*/
appended./</p>
<p>
If the function edits an existing *.zshrc*/, it is up to the user/ to
ensure that the changes made will take effect. For example, if control
usually returns early from the existing *.zshrc*/ the lines/ will not be
executed; or a later initialization file may override options or
parameters, and so on. The function itself does not attempt to detect
any such conflicts.</p>

<em><strong>reverse</strong></em>,/ and *conceal*/. Finally, there are seven codes used to
negate attributes:/ <strong>none*/ (reset all attributes to the defaults),
/*normal</strong> (neither bold nor faint), *no-standout*/, <em><strong>no-underline</strong></em>,
<em><strong>no-blink</strong></em>,/ *no-reverse*/, and <em><strong>no-conceal</strong></em>./</p>
<p>
Some terminals do not support all combinations of colors and
intensities.</p>
<p>
The associative arrays are:</p>
<p>
<strong>color</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>colour</strong> Map all the color names to their integer codes, and integer
codes to the color names. The eight base names map to the foreground
color codes, as do names prefixed with `*fg-*/&#39;, such as `/*fg-red*/&#39;.
Names prefixed/ with `*bg-*/&#39;, such as `/*bg-blue*/&#39;, refer to the
background codes. The/ reverse mapping from code to color yields base
name for foreground codes and the *bg-*/ form for backgrounds./</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although it is a misnomer to call them `colors&#39;, these arrays also map
the other fourteen attributes from names to codes and codes to names.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>fg</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>fg_bold</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>fg_no_bold</strong> Map the eight basic color names to ANSI terminal escape
sequences that set the corresponding foreground text properties. The
*fg*/ sequences change/ the color without changing the eight intensity
attributes.</p>
<p>
<strong>bg</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>bg_bold</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>bg_no_bold</strong> Map the eight basic color names to ANSI terminal escape
sequences that set the corresponding background properties. The *bg*/
sequences change the/ color without changing the eight intensity
attributes.</p>
<p>
In addition, the scalar parameters *reset_color*/ and <em><strong>bold_color</strong></em>
are/ set to the ANSI terminal escapes that turn off all attributes and
turn on bold intensity, respectively.</p>

behaves exactly like the standard /*nslookup</strong> except that it provides
customizable prompts (including a right-side prompt) and completion of
nslookup commands, host names, etc. (if you use the function-based

extended regular expressions (ERE) are used, unless the option
*RE_MATCH_PCRE*/ has been set, in which case/ Perl-compatible regular
expressions are used (this requires the shell to be linked against the
<strong>pcre</strong> library).

<em>var is the name of the variable containing the string to be matched.</em>
The variable will be modified directly by the function. The variables
<strong>MATCH*/, <em><strong>MBEGIN</strong></em>, <em><strong>MEND</strong></em>, <em><strong>match</strong></em>, <em><strong>mbegin</strong></em>, /*mend</strong> should
be avoided as these are used by the regular expression code.

<em>regexp is the regular expression to match against the string.</em>

<em>replace is the replacement text. This can contain parameter, command</em>
and arithmetic expressions which will be replaced: in particular, a
reference to *$MATCH*/ will be replaced by the text matched by the
pattern./

The return status is 0 if at least one match was performed, else 1.

Note that if using POSIX EREs, the *^*/ or word boundary operators/
(where available) may not work properly.</dd>

*run-help*/ cmd/
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This function is designed to be invoked by the
*run-help*/ ZLE widget,/ in place of the default alias. See `Accessing
On-Line Help&#39; above for setup instructions.</p>
<p>
In the discussion which follows, if <em>cmd is a file system path, it is</em>
first reduced to its rightmost component (the file name).</p>
<p>
Help is first sought by looking for a file named <em>cmd in the
directory</em> named by the *HELPDIR*/ parameter. If no file is found, an
assistant/ function, alias, or command named *run-help-*/cmd is
sought. If/ found, the assistant is executed with the rest of the
current command line (everything after the command name <em>cmd) as its
arguments. When</em> neither file nor assistant is found, the external
command `*man*/ cmd&#39; is run./</p>
<p>
An example assistant for the &#34;ssh&#34; command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
run-help-ssh() {
    emulate -LR zsh
    local -a args
    # Delete the &#34;-l username&#34; option
    zparseopts -D -E -a args l:
    # Delete other options, leaving: host command
    args=(${@:#-*})
    if [[ ${#args} -lt 2 ]]; then
        man ssh
    else
        run-help $args[2]
    fi
}

<strong>tetris</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Zsh was once accused of not being as complete as Emacs,
because it lacked a Tetris game. This function was written to refute
this vicious slander.</p>
<p>
This function must be used as a ZLE widget:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
autoload -U tetris
zle -N tetris
bindkey keys tetris
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
To start a game, execute the widget by typing the <em>keys. Whatever
command</em> line you were editing disappears temporarily, and your keymap
is also temporarily replaced by the Tetris control keys. The previous
editor state is restored when you quit the game (by pressing `*q*/&#39;)
or when you lose./</p>
<p>
If you quit in the middle of a game, the next invocation of the
<strong>tetris</strong> widget will continue where you left off. If you lost, it will
start a new game.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>tetriscurses</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a port of the above to zcurses. The input
handling is improved a bit so that moving a block sideways doesn&#39;t
automatically advance a timestep, and the graphics use unicode block
graphics.</p>
<p>
This version does not save the game state between invocations, and is
not invoked as a widget, but rather as:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
autoload -U tetriscurses
tetriscurses
</pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>

<dd>
<p><strong>zargs*/ [ option … /</strong>–<strong>/ ] [ input … ] [ /</strong>–*/ command [ arg
… ] ]/ :: This function has a similar purpose to GNU xargs. Instead
of reading lines of arguments from the standard input, it takes them
from the command line. This is useful because zsh, especially with
recursive glob operators, often can construct a command line for a
shell function that is longer than can be accepted by an external
command.</p>
<p>
The <em>option list represents options of the /*zargs*</em> command itself,/
which are the same as those of *xargs*/. The input list is the/
collection of strings (often file names) that become the arguments of
the *command*/, analogous to the standard input of <em><strong>xargs</strong></em>. Finally,
the/ <em>arg list consists of those arguments (usually options) that are</em>
passed to the <em>command each time it runs. The arg list precedes</em> the
elements from the *input*/ list in each run. If no command is/
provided, then no <em>arg list may be provided, and in that event the</em>
default command is `*print*/&#39; with arguments `/*-r –*/&#39;./</p>
<p>
For example, to get a long *ls*/ listing of all non-hidden plain
files/ in the current directory or its subdirectories:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
autoload -U zargs
zargs -- **/*(.) -- ls -ld --
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The first and third occurrences of `*–*/&#39; are used to mark the end/
of options for <strong>zargs*/ and <em><strong>ls</strong></em> respectively to guard against/
filenames starting with `</strong>-*/&#39;, while the second is used to separate
the/ list of files from the command to run (`*ls -ld –*/&#39;)./</p>
<p>
The first `*–*/&#39; would also be needed if there was a chance the/ list
might be empty as in:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zargs -r -- ./*.back(#qN) -- rm -f
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the event that the string `*–*/&#39; is or may be an input, the/ *-e*/
option may be used to change the end-of-inputs marker. Note that/ this
does <em>not change the end-of-options marker. For example, to use</em>
`*..*/&#39; as the marker:/</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zargs -e.. -- **/*(.) .. ls -ld --
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is a good choice in that example because no plain file can be
named `*..*/&#39;, but the best end-marker depends on the circumstances./</p>
<p>
The options <strong>-i*/, /</strong>-I*/, <em><strong>-l</strong></em>, <em><strong>-L</strong></em>, and <em><strong>-n</strong></em> differ slightly/
from their usage in <strong>xargs*/. There are no input lines for <em><strong>zargs</strong></em>
to/ count, so *-l*/ and /</strong>-L*/ count through the input list, and <em><strong>-n</strong>
counts the number of arguments passed to each execution of /command,</em>
<em>including any arg list. Also, any time /*-i*</em> or <em><strong>-I</strong></em> is used,/
each <em>input is processed separately as if by `/*-L*</em> <em><strong>1</strong></em>&#39;./</p>
<p>
For details of the other *zargs*/ options, see the xargs(1) man page
(but note/ the difference in function between <strong>zargs*/ and <em><strong>xargs</strong></em>)
or run/ *zargs*/ with the /</strong>–help*/ option./</p>

<p>
<strong>zed*/ [ /</strong>-h*/ [ name ] size ]/</p>
<p>
<strong>zed -b</strong> This function uses the ZLE editor to edit a file or function.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only one <em>name argument is allowed.</em> If the *-f*/ option is given, the
name is taken to be that of/ a function; if the function is marked for
autoloading, *zed*/ searches/ for it in the *fpath*/ and loads it. Note
that functions edited this way/ are installed into the current shell,
but <em>not written back to the</em> autoload file. In this case the *-x*/
option specifies that leading/ tabs indenting the function according to
syntax should be converted into the given number of spaces; `*-x 2*/&#39; is
consistent with the layout/ of functions distributed with the shell.</p>
<p>
Without *-f*/, name is the path name of the file to edit, which need/
not exist; it is created on write, if necessary. With *-h*/, the file
is/ presumed to contain history events.</p>
<p>
When no file name is provided for *-h*/ the current shell history is
edited/ in place. The history is renumbered when zed exits successfully.</p>
<p>
When editing history, multi-line events must have a trailing backslash
on every line before the last.</p>
<p>
While editing, the function sets the main keymap to *zed*/ and the/ vi
command keymap to <strong>zed-vicmd*/. These will be copied from the existing/
*main*/ and <em><strong>vicmd</strong></em> keymaps if they do not exist the first time /*zed</strong>
is run. They can be used to provide special key bindings used only in
zed.</p>
<p>
If it creates the keymap, *zed*/ rebinds the return key to insert a
line/ break and `*^X^W*/&#39; to accept the edit in the <em><strong>zed</strong></em> keymap, and
binds/ `*ZZ*/&#39; to accept the edit in the <em><strong>zed-vicmd</strong></em> keymap./</p>
<p>
The bindings alone can be installed by running `*zed -b*/&#39;. This is/
suitable for putting into a startup file. Note that, if rerun, this will
overwrite the existing *zed*/ and <em><strong>zed-vicmd</strong></em> keymaps./</p>
<p>
Completion is available, and styles may be set with the context prefix
`*:completion:zed:*/&#39;./</p>
<p>
A zle widget <strong>zed-set-file-name*/ is available. This can be called/ by
name from within zed using `</strong>\ex zed-set-file-name*/&#39; or can be/ bound
to a key in either of the *zed*/ or <em><strong>zed-vicmd</strong></em> keymaps after/ `*zed
-b*/&#39; has been run. When the widget is called, it prompts for/ a new
name for the file being edited. When zed exits the file will be written
under that name and the original file will be left alone. The widget has
no effect when invoked from `*zed -f*/&#39;. The completion/ context is
changed to `*:completion:zed-set-file-name:*/&#39;. When editing/ the
current history with `*zed -h*/&#39;, the history is first updated and/ then
the file is written, but the global setting of *HISTFILE*/ is not/
altered.</p>
<p>
While *zed-set-file-name*/ is running, zed uses the keymap/
*zed-normal-keymap*/, which is linked from the main keymap in effect/ at
the time zed initialised its bindings. (This is to make the return key
operate normally.) The result is that if the main keymap has been
changed, the widget won&#39;t notice. This is not a concern for most users.</p>

The pattern is always treated as an *EXTENDED_GLOB*/ pattern. Any file/
