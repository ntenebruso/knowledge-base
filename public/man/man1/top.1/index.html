DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The <strong>top</strong> program provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system.
It can display* system* summary information as well as a list of
<strong>processes</strong> or <strong>threads</strong> currently being managed by the Linux kernel.
The types of system summary information shown and the types, order and
size of information displayed for processes are all user configurable
and that configuration can be made persistent across restarts.</p>
<p>
The program provides a limited interactive interface for process
manipulation as well as a much more extensive interface for personal
configuration encompassing every aspect of its operation. And while
<strong>top</strong> is referred to throughout this document, you are free to name the
program anything you wish. That new name, possibly an alias, will then
be reflected on &#39;s display and used when reading and writing a
configuration file.</p>

Operation
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>When operating , the two most important keys are the help (h or ?) key
and quit (`q&#39;) key. Alternatively, you could simply use the traditional
interrupt key (^C) when you&#39;re done.</p>
<p>
When started for the first time, you&#39;ll be presented with these
traditional elements on the main screen: 1) Summary Area; 2)
Fields/Columns Header; 3) Task Area. Each of these will be explored in
the sections that follow. There is also an Input/Message line between
the Summary Area and Columns Header which needs no further explanation.</p>
<p>
The main screen is <em>generally</em> quite adaptive to changes in terminal
dimensions under X-Windows. Other screens may be less so, especially
those with static text. It ultimately depends, however, on your
particular window manager and terminal emulator. There may be occasions
when their view of terminal size and current contents differs from &#39;s
view, which is always based on operating system calls.</p>
<p>
Following any re-size operation, if a screen is corrupted, appears
incomplete or disordered, simply typing something innocuous like a
punctuation character or cursor motion key will usually restore it. In
extreme cases, the following sequence almost certainly will:</p>
<pre class="example">
       key/cmd  objective 
       ^Z       suspend 
       fg       resume 
       &lt;Left&gt;   force a screen redraw (if necessary)
</pre>
<p>
But if the display is still corrupted, there is one more step you could
try. Insert this command after has been suspended but before resuming
it.</p>
<pre class="example">
       key/cmd  objective 
       reset    restore your terminal settings
</pre>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: the width of &#39;s display will be limited to positions. Displaying
all fields requires characters. Remaining screen width is usually
allocated to any variable width columns currently visible. The variable
width columns, such as COMMAND, are noted in topic 3a. DESCRIPTIONS of
Fields. Actual output width may also be influenced by the -w switch,
which is discussed in topic 1. COMMAND-LINE Options.</p>
<p>
Lastly, some of &#39;s screens or functions require the use of cursor motion
keys like the standard arrow keys plus the Home, End, PgUp and PgDn
keys. If your terminal or emulator does not provide those keys, the
following combinations are accepted as alternatives:</p>
<pre class="example">
       key      equivalent-keys 
       Left     alt + h 
       Down     alt + j 
       Up       alt + k 
       Right    alt + l 
       Home     alt + ctrl + h 
       PgDn     alt + ctrl + j 
       PgUp     alt + ctrl + k 
       End      alt + ctrl + l
</pre>
<p>
The <strong>Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> arrow keys have special significance when prompted
for line input terminated with the &lt;Enter&gt; key. Those keys, or their
aliases, can be used to retrieve previous input lines which can then be
edited and re-input. And there are four additional keys available with
line oriented input.</p>
<pre class="example">
       key      special-significance 
       Up       recall older strings for re-editing
       Down     recall newer strings or erase entire line
       Insert   toggle between insert and overtype modes
       Delete   character removed at cursor, moving others left
       Home     jump to beginning of input line
       End      jump to end of input line

Linux Memory Types
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>For our purposes there are three types of memory, and one is optional.
First is physical memory, a limited resource where code and data must
reside when executed or referenced. Next is the optional swap file,
where modified (dirty) memory can be saved and later retrieved if too
many demands are made on physical memory. Lastly we have virtual memory,
a nearly unlimited resource serving the following goals:</p>
<pre class="example">
   1. abstraction, free from physical memory addresses/limits
   2. isolation, every process in a separate address space
   3. sharing, a single mapping can serve multiple needs
   4. flexibility, assign a virtual address to a file
</pre>
<p>
Regardless of which of these forms memory may take, all are managed as
pages (typically 4096 bytes) but expressed by default in as KiB
(kibibyte). The memory discussed under topic `2c. MEMORY Usage&#39; deals
with physical memory and the swap file for the system as a whole. The
memory reviewed in topic `3. FIELDS / Columns Display&#39; embraces all
three memory types, but for individual processes.</p>
<p>
For each such process, every memory page is restricted to a single
quadrant from the table below. Both physical memory and virtual memory
can include any of the four, while the swap file only includes #1
through #3. The memory in quadrant #4, when modified, acts as its own
dedicated swap file.</p>
<pre class="example">
                              Private | Shared
                          1           |          2
     Anonymous  . stack               |
                . malloc()            |
                . brk()/sbrk()        | . POSIX shm*
                . mmap(PRIVATE, ANON) | . mmap(SHARED, ANON)
               -----------------------+----------------------
                . mmap(PRIVATE, fd)   | . mmap(SHARED, fd)
   File-backed  . pgms/shared libs    |
                          3           |          4
</pre>
<p>
The following may help in interpreting process level memory values
displayed as scalable columns and discussed under topic `3a.
DESCRIPTIONS of Fields&#39;.</p>
<pre class="example">
   %MEM - simply RES divided by total physical memory
   CODE - the `pgms&#39; portion of quadrant 3
   DATA - the entire quadrant 1 portion of VIRT plus all
          explicit mmap file-backed pages of quadrant 3
   RES  - anything occupying physical memory which, beginning with
          Linux-4.5, is the sum of the following three fields:
          RSan - quadrant 1 pages, which include any
                 former quadrant 3 pages if modified
          RSfd - quadrant 3 and quadrant 4 pages
          RSsh - quadrant 2 pages
   RSlk - subset of RES which cannot be swapped out (any quadrant)
   SHR  - subset of RES (excludes 1, includes all 2 &amp; 4, some 3)
   SWAP - potentially any quadrant except 4
   USED - simply the sum of RES and SWAP
   VIRT - everything in-use and/or reserved (all quadrants)
</pre>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: Even though program images and shared libraries are considered
<em>private</em> to a process, they will be accounted for as <em>shared</em> (SHR) by
the kernel.</p>

Line 1 shows total* tasks* or* threads*, depending on the state of the
Threads-mode toggle. That total is further classified as:</p>
<pre class="example">
    running; sleeping; stopped; zombie
</pre>
<p>
Line 2 shows CPU state percentages based on the interval since the last

</pre>
<p>
Line 2 reflects mostly virtual memory, classified as:</p>
<pre class="example">
    total, free, used and avail (which is physical memory)
</pre>
<p>
The <strong>avail</strong> number on line 2 is an estimation of physical memory
available for starting new applications, without swapping. Unlike the
<strong>free</strong> field, it attempts to account for readily reclaimable page cache
and memory slabs. It is available on kernels 3.14, emulated on kernels
2.6.27+, otherwise the same as <strong>free</strong>.</p>
<p>
In the alternate memory display modes, two abbreviated summary lines are
shown consisting of these elements:</p>

    GiB Mem : 18.7/15.738   [ ...
    GiB Swap:  0.0/7.999    [ ...
</pre>
<p>
Where: a) is the percentage used; b) is the total available; and c) is
one of two visual graphs of those representations.</p>
<p>
In the case of physical memory, the percentage represents the <strong>total</strong>
minus the estimated <strong>avail</strong> noted above. The `Mem&#39; graph itself is
divided between <strong>used</strong> and any remaining memory not otherwise accounted
for by <strong>avail</strong>. See topic 4b. SUMMARY AREA Commands and the `m&#39; command
for additional information on that special 4-way toggle.</p>

3a. DESCRIPTIONS of Fields
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Listed below are &#39;s available process fields (columns). They are shown
in strict ascii alphabetical order. You may customize their position and
whether or not they are displayable with the `f&#39; or `F&#39; (Fields
Management) interactive commands.</p>
<p>
Any field is selectable as the sort field, and you control whether they
are sorted high-to-low or low-to-high. For additional information on
sort provisions see topic 4c. TASK AREA Commands, SORTING.</p>
<p>
The fields related to physical memory or virtual memory reference
`(KiB)&#39; which is the unsuffixed display mode. Such fields may, however,
be scaled from KiB through PiB. That scaling is influenced via the `e&#39;
interactive command or established for startup through a build option.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
1.* %CPU CPU Usage *
</dt>
<dd>The task&#39;s share of the elapsed CPU time
since the last screen update, expressed as a percentage of total CPU
time.

In a true SMP environment, if a process is multi-threaded and is <em>not</em>
operating in Threads mode, amounts greater than 100% may be reported.
You toggle Threads mode with the `H&#39; interactive command.

Also for multi-processor environments, if Irix mode is , will operate
in Solaris mode where a task&#39;s cpu usage will be divided by the total
number of CPUs. You toggle Irix/Solaris modes with the `I&#39; interactive
command.

<strong>Note</strong>: When running in forest view mode (`V&#39;) with children collapsed
(`v&#39;), this field will also include the CPU time of those unseen
children. See topic 4c. TASK AREA Commands, CONTENT for more
information regarding the `V&#39; and `v&#39; toggles.</dd>
<dt>
2.* %MEM Memory Usage (RES) *
</dt>
<dd>A task&#39;s currently resident share of
available physical memory.

See `OVERVIEW, Linux Memory Types&#39; for additional details.</dd>
<dt>
3.* CGNAME Control Group Name *
</dt>
<dd>The name of the control group to
which a process belongs, or `-&#39; if not applicable for that process.

This will typically be the last entry in the full list of control
groups as shown under the next heading (CGROUPS). And as is true
there, this field is also variable width.</dd>
<dt>
4.* CGROUPS Control Groups *
</dt>
<dd>The names of the control group(s) to
which a process belongs, or `-&#39; if not applicable for that process.

Control Groups provide for allocating resources (cpu, memory, network
bandwidth, etc.) among installation-defined groups of processes. They
enable fine-grained control over allocating, denying, prioritizing,
managing and monitoring those resources.

Many different hierarchies of cgroups can exist simultaneously on a
system and each hierarchy is attached to one or more subsystems. A
subsystem represents a single resource.

<strong>Note</strong>: The CGROUPS field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
When displayed, it plus any other variable width columns will be
allocated all remaining screen width (up to the maximum characters).
Even so, such variable width fields could still suffer truncation. See
topic 5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information on accessing
any truncated data.</dd>
<dt>
5.* CODE Code Size (KiB) *
</dt>
<dd>The amount of physical memory currently
devoted to executable code, also known as the Text Resident Set size
or TRS.

See `OVERVIEW, Linux Memory Types&#39; for additional details.</dd>
<dt>
6.* COMMAND Command Name* or Command* Line *
</dt>
<dd>Display the command
line used to start a task or the name of the associated program. You
toggle between command/ line/ and/ name/ with `c&#39;, which is both a
command-line option and an interactive command.

When you&#39;ve chosen to display command lines, processes without a
command line (like kernel threads) will be shown with only the program
name in brackets, as in this example: [kthreadd]

This field may also be impacted by the forest view display mode. See
the `V&#39; interactive command for additional information regarding that
mode.

<strong>Note</strong>: The COMMAND field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
When displayed, it plus any other variable width columns will be
allocated all remaining screen width (up to the maximum characters).
Even so, such variable width fields could still suffer truncation.
This is especially true for this field when command lines are being
displayed (the `c&#39; interactive command.) See topic 5c. SCROLLING a
Window for additional information on accessing any truncated data.</dd>
<dt>
7.* DATA Data + Stack Size (KiB) *
</dt>
<dd>The amount of private memory
<em>reserved</em> by a process. It is also known as the Data Resident Set or
DRS. Such memory may not yet be mapped to physical memory (RES) but
will always be included in the virtual memory (VIRT) amount.

See `OVERVIEW, Linux Memory Types&#39; for additional details.</dd>
<dt>
8.* ENVIRON Environment variables *
</dt>
<dd>Display all of the environment
variables, if any, as seen by the respective processes. These
variables will be displayed in their raw native order, not the sorted
order you are accustomed to seeing with an unqualified `set&#39;.

<strong>Note</strong>: The ENVIRON field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
When displayed, it plus any other variable width columns will be
allocated all remaining screen width (up to the maximum characters).
Even so, such variable width fields could still suffer truncation.
This is especially true for this field. See topic 5c. SCROLLING a
Window for additional information on accessing any truncated data.</dd>
<dt>
9.* Flags Task Flags *
</dt>
<dd>This column represents the task&#39;s current
scheduling flags which are expressed in hexadecimal notation and with
zeros suppressed. These flags are officially documented in
&lt;linux/sched.h&gt;.</dd>
<dt>
10.* GID Group Id *
</dt>
<dd>The/ effective/ group ID.</dd>
<dt>
11.* GROUP Group Name *
</dt>
<dd>The/ effective/ group name.</dd>
<dt>
12.* LXC Lxc Container Name *
</dt>
<dd>The name of the lxc container within
which a task is running. If a process is not running inside a
container, a dash (`-&#39;) will be shown.</dd>
<dt>
13.* NI Nice Value *
</dt>
<dd>The nice value of the task. A negative nice
value means higher priority, whereas a positive nice value means lower
priority. Zero in this field simply means priority will not be
adjusted in determining a task&#39;s dispatch-ability.</dd>
<dt>
14.* NU Last known NUMA node *
</dt>
<dd>A number representing the NUMA node
associated with the last used processor (`P&#39;). When -1 is displayed it
means that NUMA information is not available.

See the `&#39;2&#39; and `3&#39; interactive commands for additional NUMA
provisions affecting the summary area.</dd>
<dt>
15.* OOMa Out of Memory Adjustment Factor *
</dt>
<dd>The value, ranging from
-1000 to +1000, added to the current out of memory score (OOMs) which
is then used to determine which task to kill when memory is exhausted.</dd>
<dt>
16.* OOMs Out of Memory Score *
</dt>
<dd>The value, ranging from 0 to +1000,
used to select task(s) to kill when memory is exhausted. Zero
translates to `never kill&#39; whereas 1000 means `always kill&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
17.* P Last used CPU (SMP) *
</dt>
<dd>A number representing the last used
processor. In a true SMP environment this will likely change
frequently since the kernel intentionally uses weak affinity. Also,
the very act of running may break this weak affinity and cause more
processes to change CPUs more often (because of the extra demand for
cpu time).</dd>
<dt>
18.* PGRP Process Group Id *
</dt>
<dd>Every process is member of a unique
process group which is used for distribution of signals and by
terminals to arbitrate requests for their input and output. When a
process is created (forked), it becomes a member of the process group
of its parent. By convention, this value equals the process ID ( PID)
of the first member of a process group, called the process group
leader.</dd>
<dt>
19.* PID Process Id *
</dt>
<dd>The task&#39;s unique process ID, which
periodically wraps, though never restarting at zero. In kernel terms,
it is a dispatchable entity defined by a task_struct.

This value may also be used as: a process group ID ( PGRP); a session
ID for the session leader ( SID); a thread group ID for the thread
group leader ( TGID); and a TTY process group ID for the process group
leader ( TPGID).</dd>
<dt>
20.* PPID Parent Process Id *
</dt>
<dd>The process ID (pid) of a task&#39;s
parent.</dd>
<dt>
21.* PR Priority *
</dt>
<dd>The scheduling priority of the task. If you see
`rt&#39; in this field, it means the task is running under real time
scheduling priority.

Under linux, real time priority is somewhat misleading since
traditionally the operating itself was not preemptible. And while the
2.6 kernel can be made mostly preemptible, it is not always so.</dd>
<dt>
22.* RES Resident Memory Size (KiB) *
</dt>
<dd>A subset of the virtual
address space (VIRT) representing the non-swapped physical memory a
task is currently using. It is also the sum of the RSan, RSfd and RSsh
fields.

It can include private anonymous pages, private pages mapped to files
(including program images and shared libraries) plus shared anonymous
pages. All such memory is backed by the swap file represented
separately under SWAP.

Lastly, this field may also include shared file-backed pages which,
when modified, act as a dedicated swap file and thus will never impact
SWAP.

See `OVERVIEW, Linux Memory Types&#39; for additional details.</dd>
<dt>
23.* RSan Resident Anonymous Memory Size (KiB) *
</dt>
<dd>A subset of
resident memory (RES) representing private pages not mapped to a file.</dd>
<dt>
24.* RSfd Resident File-Backed Memory Size (KiB) *
</dt>
<dd>A subset of
resident memory (RES) representing the implicitly shared pages
supporting program images and shared libraries. It also includes
explicit file mappings, both private and shared.</dd>
<dt>
25.* RSlk Resident Locked Memory Size (KiB) *
</dt>
<dd>A subset of resident
memory (RES) which cannot be swapped out.</dd>
<dt>
26.* RSsh Resident Shared Memory Size (KiB) *
</dt>
<dd>A subset of resident
memory (RES) representing the explicitly shared anonymous shm*/mmap
pages.</dd>
<dt>
27.* RUID Real User Id *
</dt>
<dd>The/ real/ user ID.</dd>
<dt>
28.* RUSER Real User Name *
</dt>
<dd>The/ real/ user name.</dd>
<dt>
29.* S Process Status *
</dt>
<dd>The status of the task which can be one of:
<strong>D</strong> = uninterruptible sleep <strong>I</strong> = idle <strong>R</strong> = running <strong>S</strong> = sleeping
<strong>T</strong> = stopped by job control signal <strong>t</strong> = stopped by debugger during
trace <strong>Z</strong> = zombie

Tasks shown as running should be more properly thought of as ready to
run their task_struct is simply represented on the Linux run-queue.
Even without a true SMP machine, you may see numerous tasks in this
state depending on &#39;s delay interval and nice value.</dd>
<dt>
30.* SHR Shared Memory Size (KiB) *
</dt>
<dd>A subset of resident memory
(RES) that may be used by other processes. It will include shared
anonymous pages and shared file-backed pages. It also includes private
pages mapped to files representing program images and shared
libraries.

See `OVERVIEW, Linux Memory Types&#39; for additional details.</dd>
<dt>
31.* SID Session Id *
</dt>
<dd>A session is a collection of process groups (
PGRP), usually established by the login shell. A newly forked process
joins the session of its creator. By convention, this value equals the
process ID ( PID) of the first member of the session, called the
session leader, which is usually the login shell.</dd>
<dt>
32.* SUID Saved User Id *
</dt>
<dd>The/ saved/ user ID.</dd>
<dt>
33.* SUPGIDS Supplementary Group IDs *
</dt>
<dd>The IDs of any supplementary
group(s) established at login or inherited from a task&#39;s parent. They
are displayed in a comma delimited list.

<strong>Note</strong>: The SUPGIDS field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
When displayed, it plus any other variable width columns will be
allocated all remaining screen width (up to the maximum characters).
Even so, such variable width fields could still suffer truncation. See
topic 5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information on accessing
any truncated data.</dd>
<dt>
34.* SUPGRPS Supplementary Group Names *
</dt>
<dd>The names of any
supplementary group(s) established at login or inherited from a task&#39;s
parent. They are displayed in a comma delimited list.

<strong>Note</strong>: The SUPGRPS field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
When displayed, it plus any other variable width columns will be
allocated all remaining screen width (up to the maximum characters).
Even so, such variable width fields could still suffer truncation. See
topic 5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information on accessing
any truncated data.</dd>
<dt>
35.* SUSER Saved User Name *
</dt>
<dd>The/ saved/ user name.</dd>
<dt>
36.* SWAP Swapped Size (KiB) *
</dt>
<dd>The formerly resident portion of a
task&#39;s address space written to the swap file when physical memory
becomes over committed.

See `OVERVIEW, Linux Memory Types&#39; for additional details.</dd>
<dt>
37.* TGID Thread Group Id *
</dt>
<dd>The ID of the thread group to which a
task belongs. It is the PID of the thread group leader. In kernel
terms, it represents those tasks that share an mm_struct.</dd>
<dt>
38.* TIME CPU Time *
</dt>
<dd>Total CPU time the task has used since it
started. When Cumulative mode is <em>On</em>, each process is listed with the
cpu time that it and its dead children have used. You toggle
Cumulative mode with `S&#39;, which is both a command-line option and an
interactive command. See the `S&#39; interactive command for additional
information regarding this mode.</dd>
<dt>
39.* TIME+ CPU Time, hundredths *
</dt>
<dd>The same as TIME, but reflecting
more granularity through hundredths of a second.</dd>
<dt>
40.* TPGID Tty Process Group Id *
</dt>
<dd>The process group ID of the
foreground process for the connected tty, or -1 if a process is not
connected to a terminal. By convention, this value equals the process
ID ( PID) of the process group leader ( PGRP).</dd>
<dt>
41.* TTY Controlling Tty *
</dt>
<dd>The name of the controlling terminal.
This is usually the device (serial port, pty, etc.) from which the
process was started, and which it uses for input or output. However, a
task need not be associated with a terminal, in which case you&#39;ll see
`?&#39; displayed.</dd>
<dt>
42.* UID User Id *
</dt>
<dd>The/ effective/ user ID of the task&#39;s owner.</dd>
<dt>
43.* USED Memory in Use (KiB) *
</dt>
<dd>This field represents the
non-swapped physical memory a task is using (RES) plus the swapped out
portion of its address space (SWAP).

See `OVERVIEW, Linux Memory Types&#39; for additional details.</dd>
<dt>
44.* USER User Name *
</dt>
<dd>The/ effective/ user name of the task&#39;s
owner.</dd>
<dt>
45.* VIRT Virtual Memory Size (KiB) *
</dt>
<dd>The total amount of virtual
memory used by the task. It includes all code, data and shared
libraries plus pages that have been swapped out and pages that have
been mapped but not used.

See `OVERVIEW, Linux Memory Types&#39; for additional details.</dd>
<dt>
46.* WCHAN Sleeping in Function *
</dt>
<dd>This field will show the name of
the kernel function in which the task is currently sleeping. Running
tasks will display a dash (`-&#39;) in this column.</dd>
<dt>
47.* nDRT Dirty Pages Count *
</dt>
<dd>The number of pages that have been
modified since they were last written to auxiliary storage. Dirty
pages must be written to auxiliary storage before the corresponding
physical memory location can be used for some other virtual page.

This field was deprecated with linux 2.6 and is always zero.</dd>
<dt>
48.* nMaj Major Page Fault Count *
</dt>
<dd>The number of* major* page
faults that have occurred for a task. A page fault occurs when a
process attempts to read from or write to a virtual page that is not
currently present in its address space. A major page fault is when
auxiliary storage access is involved in making that page available.</dd>
<dt>
49.* nMin Minor Page Fault count *
</dt>
<dd>The number of* minor* page
faults that have occurred for a task. A page fault occurs when a
process attempts to read from or write to a virtual page that is not

involve auxiliary storage access in making that page available.</dd>
<dt>
50.* nTH Number of Threads *
</dt>
<dd>The number of threads associated with
a process.</dd>
<dt>
51.* nsIPC IPC namespace *

isolate interprocess communication (IPC) resources such as System V
IPC objects and POSIX message queues.</dd>
<dt>
52.* nsMNT MNT namespace *
</dt>
<dd>The Inode of the namespace used to
isolate filesystem mount points thus offering different views of the
filesystem hierarchy.</dd>
<dt>
53.* nsNET NET namespace *
</dt>
<dd>The Inode of the namespace used to
isolate resources such as network devices, IP addresses, IP routing,
port numbers, etc.</dd>
<dt>
54.* nsPID PID namespace *
</dt>
<dd>The Inode of the namespace used to
isolate process ID numbers meaning they need not remain unique. Thus,
each such namespace could have its own `init/systemd&#39; (PID #1) to
manage various initialization tasks and reap orphaned child processes.</dd>
<dt>
55.* nsUSER USER namespace *
</dt>
<dd>The Inode of the namespace used to
isolate the user and group ID numbers. Thus, a process could have a
normal unprivileged user ID outside a user namespace while having a
user ID of 0, with full root privileges, inside that namespace.</dd>
<dt>
56.* nsUTS UTS namespace *
</dt>
<dd>The Inode of the namespace used to
isolate hostname and NIS domain name. UTS simply means &#34;UNIX
Time-sharing System&#34;.</dd>

<p>The global interactive commands are* always* available in both
full-screen mode and alternate-display mode. However, some of these
interactive commands are* not available* when running in Secure mode.</p>
<p>
If you wish to know in advance whether or not your has been secured,
simply ask for help and view the system summary on the second line.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
&lt;*Enter*&gt; or &lt;*Space*&gt; :/Refresh-Display /
</dt>
<dd>These commands awaken
and following receipt of any input the entire display will be
repainted. They also force an update of any hotplugged cpu or physical
memory changes.

Use either of these keys if you have a large delay interval and wish
to see current status,</dd>
<dt>
<strong>?</strong> | <strong>h</strong> :/Help /
</dt>
<dd>There are two help levels available. The first
will provide a reminder of all the basic interactive commands. If is/
secured/, that screen will be abbreviated.

Typing `h&#39; or `?&#39; on that help screen will take you to help for those
interactive commands applicable to alternate-display mode.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>=</strong> :/Exit-Display-Limits /
</dt>
<dd>Removes restrictions on what is shown.
This command will reverse any `i&#39; (idle tasks), `n&#39; (max tasks) and
`v&#39; (hide children) commands that might be active. It also provides
for an exit from PID monitoring, User filtering, Other filtering,
Locate processing and Combine Cpus mode.

Additionally, if the window has been scrolled it will be reset with
this command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>0</strong> :/Zero-Suppress/ toggle 
</dt>
<dd>This command determines whether zeros
are shown or suppressed for many of the fields in a task window.
Fields like UID, GID, NI, PR or P are not affected by this toggle.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>A</strong> :/Alternate-Display-Mode/ toggle 
</dt>
<dd>This command will switch
between full-screen mode and alternate-display mode. See topic 5.
ALTERNATE-DISPLAY Provisions and the `g&#39; interactive command for
insight into `current&#39; windows and field groups.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>B</strong> :/Bold-Disable/Enable/ toggle 
</dt>
<dd>This command will influence use
of the bold terminfo capability and alters* both* the summary area and
task area for the `current&#39; window. While it is intended primarily for
use with dumb terminals, it can be applied anytime.

<strong>Note</strong>: When this toggle is <em>On</em> and is operating in monochrome mode,
the* entire display* will appear as normal text. Thus, unless the `x&#39;
and/or `y&#39; toggles are using reverse for emphasis, there will be no
visual confirmation that they are even on.</dd>
<dt>
* <strong>d</strong> | <strong>s</strong> :/Change-Delay-Time-interval /
</dt>
<dd>You will be prompted to
enter the delay time, in seconds, between display updates.

Fractional seconds are honored, but a negative number is not allowed.
Entering 0 causes (nearly) continuous updates, with an unsatisfactory
display as the system and tty driver try to keep up with &#39;s demands.
The delay value is inversely proportional to system loading, so set it
with care.

If at any time you wish to know the current delay time, simply ask for
help and view the system summary on the second line.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>E</strong> :/Enforce-Summary-Memory-Scale/ in Summary Area

scaling which ranges from KiB (kibibytes or 1,024 bytes) through EiB
(exbibytes or 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 bytes).

If you see a `+&#39; between a displayed number and the following label,
it means that was forced to truncate some portion of that number. By
raising the scaling factor, such truncation can be avoided.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>e</strong> :/Enforce-Task-Memory-Scale/ in Task Area
</dt>
<dd>With this command

ranges from KiB (kibibytes or 1,024 bytes) through PiB (pebibytes or
1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes).

While will try to honor the selected target range, additional scaling
might still be necessary in order to accommodate current values. If
you wish to see a more homogeneous result in the memory columns,
raising the scaling range will usually accomplish that goal. Raising
it too high, however, is likely to produce an all zero result which
cannot be suppressed with the `0&#39; interactive command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>g</strong> :/Choose-Another-Window/Field-Group /

<strong>I</strong> :/Irix/Solaris-Mode/ toggle 
</dt>
<dd>When operating in Solaris mode
(`I&#39; toggled ), a task&#39;s cpu usage will be divided by the total number

this toggle.</dd>
<dt>
* <strong>k</strong> :/Kill-a-task /
</dt>
<dd>You will be prompted for a PID and then the
signal to send.

Entering no PID or a negative number will be interpreted as the
default shown in the prompt (the first task displayed). A PID value of
zero means the program itself.

The default signal, as reflected in the prompt, is SIGTERM. However,
you can send any signal, via number or name.

If you wish to abort the kill process, do one of the following
depending on your progress:</dd>
</dl>
<pre class="example">
    1) at the pid prompt, type an invalid number
    2) at the signal prompt, type 0 (or any invalid signal)
    3) at any prompt, type &lt;Esc&gt;

<dl>
<dt>
<strong>q</strong> :/Quit /
</dt>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>
* <strong>r</strong> :/Renice-a-Task /
</dt>
<dd>You will be prompted for
a PID and then the value to nice it to.

Entering no PID or a negative number will be interpreted as the
default shown in the prompt (the first task displayed). A PID value
of zero means the program itself.

A positive nice value will cause a process to lose priority.
Conversely, a negative nice value will cause a process to be viewed
more favorably by the kernel. As a general rule, ordinary users can
only increase the nice value and are prevented from lowering it.

If you wish to abort the renice process, do one of the following
depending on your progress:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<pre class="example">
    1) at the pid prompt, type an invalid number

<strong>X</strong> :/Extra-Fixed-Width /
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Some fields are fixed width and not
scalable. As such, they are subject to truncation which would be
indicated by a `+&#39; in the last position.</p>
<p>
This interactive command can be used to alter the widths of the
following fields:</p>
<pre class="example">
    field  default    field  default    field  default 
    GID       5       GROUP     8       WCHAN    10
    RUID      5       LXC       8       nsIPC    10
    SUID      5       RUSER     8       nsMNT    10
    UID       5       SUSER     8       nsNET    10
                      TTY       8       nsPID    10
                      USER      8       nsUSER   10
                                        nsUTS    10
</pre>
<p>
You will be prompted for the amount to be added to the default widths
shown above. Entering zero forces a return to those defaults.</p>
<p>
If you enter a negative number, will automatically increase the column
size as needed until there is no more truncated data. You can
accelerate this process by reducing the delay interval or holding down
the &lt;Space&gt; bar.</p>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: Whether explicitly or automatically increased, the widths for
these fields are never decreased by . To narrow them you must specify
a smaller number or restore the defaults.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Y</strong> :/Inspect-Other-Output /
</dt>
<dd>
<p>After issuing the `Y&#39; interactive
command, you will be prompted for a target PID. Typing a value or
accepting the default results in a separate screen. That screen can be
used to view a variety of files or piped command output while the
normal iterative display is paused.</p>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: This interactive command is only fully realized when
supporting entries have been manually added to the end of the
configuration file. For details on creating those entries, see topic
6b. ADDING INSPECT Entries.</p>
<p>
Most of the keys used to navigate the Inspect feature are reflected in
its header prologue. There are, however, additional keys available
once you have selected a particular file or command. They are familiar
to anyone who has used the pager `less&#39; and are summarized here for
future reference.</p>

4b. SUMMARY AREA Commands
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-18" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The summary area interactive commands are* always available* in both
full-screen mode and alternate-display mode. They affect the beginning
lines of your display and will determine the position of messages and
prompts.</p>
<p>
These commands always impact just the `current&#39; window/field group. See
topic 5. ALTERNATE-DISPLAY Provisions and the `g&#39; interactive command
for insight into `current&#39; windows and field groups.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>C</strong> :/Show-scroll-coordinates/ toggle 
</dt>
<dd>Toggle an informational
message which is displayed whenever the message line is not otherwise
being used. For additional information see topic 5c. SCROLLING a
Window.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>l</strong> :/Load-Average/Uptime/ toggle 
</dt>
<dd>This is also the line
containing the program name (possibly an alias) when operating in
full-screen mode or the `current&#39; window name when operating in
alternate-display mode.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>t</strong> :/Task/Cpu-States/ toggle 
</dt>
<dd>This command affects from 2 to many
summary area lines, depending on the state of the `1&#39;, `2&#39; or `3&#39;
command toggles and whether or not is running under true SMP.

This portion of the summary area is also influenced by the `H&#39;
interactive command toggle, as reflected in the total label which
shows either Tasks or Threads.

This command serves as a 4-way toggle, cycling through these modes:</dd>
</dl>
<pre class="example">
    1. detailed percentages by category
    2. abbreviated user/system and total % + bar graph
    3. abbreviated user/system and total % + block graph
    4. turn off task and cpu states display
</pre>
<p>
When operating in either of the graphic modes, the display becomes much
more meaningful when individual CPUs or NUMA nodes are also displayed.
See the the `1&#39;, `2&#39; and `3&#39; commands below for additional information.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>m</strong> :/Memory/Swap-Usage/ toggle 
</dt>
<dd>This command affects the two
summary area lines dealing with physical and virtual memory.

This command serves as a 4-way toggle, cycling through these modes:</dd>
</dl>
<pre class="example">
    1. detailed percentages by memory type
    2. abbreviated % used/total available + bar graph
    3. abbreviated % used/total available + block graph
    4. turn off memory display
</pre>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>1</strong> :/Single/Separate-Cpu-States/ toggle 
</dt>
<dd>This command affects how
the `t&#39; command&#39;s Cpu States portion is shown. Although this toggle
exists primarily to serve massively-parallel SMP machines, it is not
restricted to solely SMP environments.

When you see `%Cpu(s):&#39; in the summary area, the `1&#39; toggle is <em>On</em>
and all cpu information is gathered in a single line. Otherwise, each
cpu is displayed separately as: `%Cpu0, %Cpu1, â€¦&#39; up to available
screen height.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>2</strong> :/NUMA-Nodes/Cpu-Summary/ toggle 
</dt>
<dd>This command toggles between
the `1&#39; command cpu summary display (only) or a summary display plus
the cpu usage statistics for each NUMA Node. It is only available if a
system has the requisite NUMA support.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>3</strong> :/Expand-NUMA-Node /
</dt>
<dd>You will be invited to enter a number
representing a NUMA Node. Thereafter, a node summary plus the
statistics for each cpu in that node will be shown until the `1&#39;, `2&#39;
or `4&#39; command toggle is pressed. This interactive command is only
available if a system has the requisite NUMA support.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>4</strong> :/Display-Cpus-Two-Abreast /
</dt>
<dd>This command turns the `1&#39; toggle
for individual cpu display but prints the results two abreast. It
requires a terminal with a minimum width of 80 columns. If a
terminal&#39;s width is decreased below the minimum while is running,
reverts to the normal `1&#39; toggle state.

To avoid truncation when displaying detailed cpu statistcs, as opposed
to the graphic representations, a minimum width of 165 columns would
be required.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>!</strong> :/Combine-Cpus-Mode /
</dt>
<dd>This command toggle is intended for
massively parallel SMP environments where, even with the `4&#39; command
toggle, not all processors can be displayed. With each press of `!&#39;
the number of additional cpu&#39;s combined is doubled thus reducing the
total number of cpu lines displayed.

For example, with the first press of `!&#39; one additional cpu will be
combined and displayed as `0-1, 2-3, â€¦&#39; instead of the normal
`%Cpu0, %Cpu1, %Cpu2, %Cpu3, â€¦&#39;. With a second `!&#39; command toggle
two additional cpus are combined and shown as `0-2, 3-5, â€¦&#39;. Then
the third &#39;!&#39; press, combining four additional cpus, shows as `0-4,
5-9, â€¦&#39;, etc.

Such progression continues until individual cpus are again displayed
and impacts both the `1&#39; and `4&#39; toggles (one or two columns). Use the
`=&#39; command to exit <strong>Combine Cpus</strong> mode.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If the entire summary area has been toggled for any window, you
would be left with just the* message line*. In that way, you will have
maximized available task rows but (temporarily) sacrificed the program
name in full-screen mode or the `current&#39; window name when in
alternate-display mode.</p>

effective, saved, or filesystem).

Thereafter, in that task window only matching users will be shown, or
possibly no processes will be shown. Prepending an exclamation point
(`!&#39;) to the user id or name instructs to display only processes with
users not matching the one provided.

Different task windows can be used to filter different users. Later,

switches between the currently visible task display(s) and any task
display(s) you had toggled . If all 4 task displays are currently
visible, this interactive command will leave the summary area as the
only display element.</dd>
<dt>
* <strong>=</strong> | <strong>+</strong> :/Equalize/Reset-Window(s) /
</dt>
<dd>The `=&#39; key forces the
`current&#39; window&#39;s task display to be visible. It also reverses any
active `i&#39; (idle tasks), `n&#39; (max tasks), `u/U&#39; (user filter), `o/O&#39;
(other filter), `v&#39; (hide children), `L&#39; (locate) and `!&#39; (combine
cpus) commands. Also, if the window had been scrolled, it will be
reset with this command. See topic 5c. SCROLLING a Window for
additional information regarding vertical and horizontal scrolling.

The `+&#39; key does the same for all windows. The four task displays will
reappear, evenly balanced, while retaining any customizations
previously applied beyond those noted for the `=&#39; command toggle.</dd>
<dt>
* <strong>A</strong> :/Alternate-Display-Mode/ toggle 
</dt>
<dd>This command will switch
between full-screen mode and alternate-display mode.

shown. Thereafter when you switch modes, you will see only the task
display(s) you&#39;ve chosen to make visible.</dd>
<dt>
* <strong>a</strong> | <strong>w</strong> :/Next-Window-Forward/Backward /
</dt>
<dd>This will change the
`current&#39; window, which in turn changes the window to which commands
are directed. These keys act in a circular fashion so you can reach
any desired window using either key.

Assuming the window name is visible (you have not toggled `l&#39; ),
whenever the `current&#39; window name loses its emphasis/color, that&#39;s a
reminder the task display is and many commands will be restricted.</dd>

<dd>You will be prompted to
enter a number between 1 and 4 designating the field group which
should be made the `current&#39; window.

In full-screen mode, this command is necessary to alter the `current&#39;

5c. SCROLLING a Window
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-24" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Typically a task window is a partial view into a systems&#39;s total
tasks/threads which shows only some of the available fields/columns.
With these scrolling keys, you can move that view vertically or
horizontally to reveal any desired task or column.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Up</strong>,*PgUp* :/Scroll-Tasks /
</dt>
<dd>Move the view up toward the first task
row, until the first task is displayed at the top of the `current&#39;
window. The <em>Up</em> arrow key moves a single line while <em>PgUp</em> scrolls
the entire window.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Down</strong>,*PgDn* :/Scroll-Tasks /
</dt>
<dd>Move the view down toward the last
task row, until the last task is the only task displayed at the top of
the `current&#39; window. The <em>Down</em> arrow key moves a single line while
<em>PgDn</em> scrolls the entire window.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Left</strong>,*Right* :/Scroll-Columns /
</dt>
<dd>Move the view of displayable
fields horizontally one column at a time.

<strong>Note</strong>: As a reminder, some fields/columns are not fixed-width but
allocated all remaining screen width when visible. When scrolling
right or left, that feature may produce some unexpected results
initially.

Additionally, there are special provisions for any variable width
field when positioned as the last displayed field. Once that field is
reached via the right arrow key, and is thus the only column shown,
you can continue scrolling horizontally within such a field. See the
`C&#39; interactive command below for additional information.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Home</strong> :/Jump-to-Home-Position /
</dt>
<dd>Reposition the display to the
un-scrolled coordinates.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>End</strong> :/Jump-to-End-Position /
</dt>
<dd>Reposition the display so that the
rightmost column reflects the last displayable field and the bottom
task row represents the last task.

<strong>Note</strong>: From this position it is still possible to scroll/ down/ and/
right/ using the arrow keys. This is true until a single column and a
single task is left as the only display element.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>C</strong> :/Show-scroll-coordinates/ toggle 
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Toggle an informational
message which is displayed whenever the message line is not otherwise
being used. That message will take one of two forms depending on
whether or not a variable width column has also been scrolled.</p>
<pre class="example">
  scroll coordinates: y = n/n (tasks), x = n/n (fields)
  scroll coordinates: y = n/n (tasks), x = n/n (fields) + nn
</pre>
<p>
The coordinates shown as <strong>n*/*n</strong> are relative to the upper left corner
of the `current&#39; window. The additional `*+ nn*&#39; represents the
displacement into a variable width column when it has been scrolled
horizontally. Such displacement occurs in normal 8 character tab stop
amounts via the right and left arrow keys.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
*y = n/n (tasks) *
</dt>
<dd>The first <strong>n</strong> represents the topmost visible
task and is controlled by scrolling keys. The second <strong>n</strong> is updated
automatically to reflect total tasks.</dd>
<dt>
*x = n/n (fields) *
</dt>
<dd>The first <strong>n</strong> represents the leftmost displayed
column and is controlled by scrolling keys. The second <strong>n</strong> is the
total number of displayable fields and is established with the `*f*&#39;
interactive command.

The above interactive commands are* always* available in full-screen
mode but* never* available in alternate-display mode if the `current&#39;
window&#39;s task display has been toggled .

<strong>Note</strong>: When any form of filtering is active, you can expect some
slight aberrations when scrolling since not all tasks will be visible.
This is particularly apparent when using the Up/Down arrow keys.</dd>

5d. SEARCHING in a Window

<p>You can use these interactive commands to locate a task row containing a
particular value.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>L</strong> :/Locate-a-string/
</dt>
<dd>You will be prompted for the case-sensitive
string to locate starting from the current window coordinates. There
are no restrictions on search string content.

Searches are not limited to values from a single field or column. All
of the values displayed in a task row are allowed in a search string.
You may include spaces, numbers, symbols and even forest view artwork.

Keying &lt;Enter&gt; with no input will effectively disable the `&amp;&#39; key
until a new search string is entered.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>&amp;</strong> :/Locate-next/
</dt>
<dd>Assuming a search string has been established,
will attempt to locate the next occurrence.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When a match is found, the current window is repositioned vertically so
the task row containing that string is first. The scroll coordinates
message can provide confirmation of such vertical repositioning (see the
`C&#39; interactive command). Horizontal scrolling, however, is never
altered via searching.</p>
<p>
The availability of a matching string will be influenced by the
following factors.</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
a. Which fields are displayable from the total available,
</dt>

</dt>
<dd>see the `c&#39;

<dt>
d. The stability of the chosen sort column,
</dt>
<dd>for example PID is good
but %CPU bad.

If a search fails, restoring the `current&#39; window home (unscrolled)
position, scrolling horizontally, displaying command-lines or choosing
a more stable sort field could yet produce a successful `&amp;&#39; search.

The above interactive commands are* always* available in full-screen
mode but* never* available in alternate-display mode if the `current&#39;
window&#39;s task display has been toggled .

<strong>Note</strong>: Whenever a Search is active in a window, will turn column
highlighting to prevent false matches on internal non-display escape
sequences. Such highlighting will be restored when a window&#39;s search

5e. FILTERING in a Window
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-26" class="outline-text-3">
<p>You can use this `Other Filter&#39; feature to establish selection criteria
which will then determine which tasks are shown in the `current&#39; window.
Such filters can be made presistent if preserved in the rcfile via the
&#39;W&#39; interactive command.</p>
<p>
Establishing a filter requires: 1) a field name; 2) an operator; and 3)
a selection value, as a minimum. This is the most complex of &#39;s user
input requirements so, when you make a mistake, command recall will be
your friend. Remember the Up/Down arrow keys or their aliases when
prompted for input.</p>
<p>
<strong>Filter Basics</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
1. field names are case sensitive and spelled as in the header
</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>
selection values need not comprise the full displayed field :: - 3.
 a selection is either case insensitive or sensitive to case :: - 4.
   the default is inclusion, prepending `!&#39; denotes
   exclusions :: - 5. multiple selection criteria can be applied to
     a task window :: - 6. inclusion and exclusion criteria can be
       used simultaneously :: - 7. the 1 equality and 2 relational
         filters can be freely mixed :: - 8. separate unique
           filters are maintained for each task window :: </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If a field is not turned on or is not currently in view, then your
selection criteria will not affect the display. Later, should a filtered
field become visible, the selection criteria will then be applied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Keyboard Summary</strong></p>

<dt>
<strong>^O</strong> :/Show-Active-Filters/ (Ctrl key + `o&#39;)

<dt>
<strong>=</strong> :/Reset-Filtering/ in current window
</dt>
<dd>This clears all of your
selection criteria in the `current&#39; window. It also has additional
impact so please see topic 4a. GLOBAL Commands.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>+</strong> :/Reset-Filtering/ in all windows
</dt>
<dd>This clears the selection
criteria in all windows, assuming you are in alternate-display mode.
As with the `=&#39; interactive command, it too has additional
consequences so you might wish to see topic 5b. COMMANDS for Windows.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Input Requirements</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When prompted for selection criteria, the data you provide must take one
of two forms. There are 3 required pieces of information, with a 4th as
optional. These examples use spaces for clarity but your input generally
would not.</p>
<pre class="example">
        #1           #2  #3              ( required )
        Field-Name   ?   include-if-value
     !  Field-Name   ?   exclude-if-value
     #4                                  ( optional )
</pre>
<p>
Items #1, #3 and #4 should be self-explanatory. Item <strong>#2</strong> represents
both a required <em>delimiter</em> and the <em>operator</em> which must be one of
either equality (`=&#39;) or relation (`&lt;&#39; or `&gt;&#39;).</p>
<p>
The `=&#39; equality operator requires only a partial match and that can
reduce your `if-value&#39; input requirements. The `&gt;&#39; or `&lt;&#39; relational
operators always employ string comparisons, even with numeric fields.
They are designed to work with a field&#39;s default <em>justification</em> and
with homogeneous data. When some field&#39;s numeric amounts have been
subjected to <em>scaling</em> while others have not, that data is no longer
homogeneous.</p>
<p>
If you establish a relational filter and you <strong>have</strong> changed the default
Numeric or Character <em>justification</em>, that filter is likely to fail.
When a relational filter is applied to a memory field and you <strong>have not</strong>
changed the <em>scaling</em>, it may produce misleading results. This happens,
for example, because `100.0m&#39; (MiB) would appear greater than `1.000g&#39;
(GiB) when compared as strings.</p>
<p>
If your filtered results appear suspect, simply altering justification
or scaling may yet achieve the desired objective. See the `j&#39;, `J&#39; and
`e&#39; interactive commands for additional information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Potential Problems</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These <strong>GROUP</strong> filters could produce the exact same results or the second
one might not display anything at all, just a blank task window.</p>
<pre class="example">
     GROUP=root        ( only the same results when )
     GROUP=ROOT        ( invoked via lower case `o&#39; )
</pre>
<p>
Either of these <strong>RES</strong> filters might yield inconsistent and/or misleading
results, depending on the current memory scaling factor. Or both filters
could produce the exact same results.</p>
<pre class="example">
     RES&gt;9999          ( only the same results when )
     !RES&lt;10000        ( memory scaling is at `KiB&#39; )
</pre>
<p>
This <strong>nMin</strong> filter illustrates a problem unique to scalable fields. This
particular field can display a maximum of 4 digits, beyond which values
are automatically scaled to KiB or above. So while amounts greater than
9999 exist, they will appear as 2.6m, 197k, etc.</p>
<pre class="example">
     nMin&gt;9999         ( always a blank task window )
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Potential Solutions</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These examples illustrate how Other Filtering can be creatively applied
to achieve almost any desired result. Single quotes are sometimes shown
to delimit the spaces which are part of a filter or to represent a
request for status (^O) accurately. But if you used them with if-values
in real life, no matches would be found.</p>
<p>
Assuming field <strong>nTH</strong> is displayed, the first filter will result in only
multi-threaded processes being shown. It also reminds us that a trailing
space is part of every displayed field. The second filter achieves the
exact same results with less typing.</p>
<pre class="example">
     !nTH=` 1 &#39;                ( &#39; for clarity only )
     nTH&gt;1                     ( same with less i/p )
</pre>
<p>
With Forest View mode active and the <strong>COMMAND</strong> column in view, this
filter effectively collapses child processes so that just 3 levels are
shown.</p>
<pre class="example">
     !COMMAND=`       `- &#39;     ( &#39; for clarity only )
</pre>
<p>
The final two filters appear as in response to the status request key
(^O). In reality, each filter would have required separate input. The
<strong>PR</strong> example shows the two concurrent filters necessary to display tasks
with priorities of 20 or more, since some might be negative. Then by
exploiting trailing spaces, the <strong>nMin</strong> series of filters could achieve
the failed `9999&#39; objective discussed above.</p>
<pre class="example">
     `PR&gt;20&#39; + `!PR=-&#39;         ( 2 for right result )
     `!nMin=0 &#39; + `!nMin=1 &#39; + `!nMin=2 &#39; + `!nMin=3 &#39; ...
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Whenever Other Filtering is active in a window, will turn column
highlighting to prevent false matches on internal non-display escape
sequences. Such highlighting will be restored when a window is no longer
subject to filtering. See the `x&#39; interactive command for additional
information on sort column highlighting.</p>

6b. ADDING INSPECT Entries
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-29" class="outline-text-3">
<p>To exploit the `Y&#39; interactive command, you must add entries at the*
end* of the personal configuration file. Such entries simply reflect a
file to be read or command/pipeline to be executed whose results will
then be displayed in a separate scrollable, searchable window.</p>
<p>
If you don&#39;t know the location or name of your rcfile, use the `W&#39;
interactive command to rewrite it and note those details.</p>
<p>
Inspect entries can be added with a redirected echo or by editing the
configuration file. Redirecting an echo risks overwriting the rcfile
should it replace (&gt;) rather than append (&gt;&gt;) to that file. Conversely,
when using an editor care must be taken not to corrupt existing lines,
some of which will contain unprintable data or unusual characters.</p>
<p>
Those Inspect entries beginning with a `#&#39; character are ignored,
regardless of content. Otherwise they consist of the following 3
elements, each of which/ must/ be separated by a tab character (thus 2
`\t&#39; total):</p>
<pre class="example">
  .type:  literal `file&#39; or `pipe&#39;
  .name:  selection shown on the Inspect screen
  .fmts:  string representing a path or command
</pre>
<p>
The two types of Inspect entries are/ not/ interchangeable. Those
designated `*file*&#39; will be accessed using fopen and must reference a
single file in the `.fmts&#39; element. Entries specifying `*pipe*&#39; will
employ popen, their `.fmts&#39; element could contain many pipelined
commands and, none can be interactive.</p>
<p>
If the file or pipeline represented in your `.fmts&#39; deals with the
specific PID input or accepted when prompted, then the format string
must also contain the `*%d*&#39; specifier, as these examples illustrate.</p>
<pre class="example">
  .fmts=  /proc/%d/numa_maps
  .fmts=  lsof -P -p %d
</pre>
<p>
For `*pipe*&#39; type entries only, you may also wish to redirect stderr to
stdout for a more comprehensive result. Thus the format string becomes:</p>
<pre class="example">
  .fmts=  pmap -x %d 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre>
<p>
Here are examples of both types of Inspect entries as they might appear
in the rcfile. The first entry will be ignored due to the initial `#&#39;
character. For clarity, the pseudo tab depictions (^I) are surrounded by
an extra space but the actual tabs would not be.</p>
<pre class="example">
  # pipe ^I Sockets ^I lsof -n -P -i 2&gt;&amp;1
  pipe ^I Open Files ^I lsof -P -p %d 2&gt;&amp;1
  file ^I NUMA Info ^I /proc/%d/numa_maps
  pipe ^I Log ^I tail -n100 /var/log/syslog | sort -Mr
</pre>
<p>
Except for the commented entry above, these next examples show what
could be echoed to achieve similar results, assuming the rcfile name was
`.toprc&#39;. However, due to the embedded tab characters, each of these
lines should be preceded by `*/bin/echo -e*&#39;, not just a simple an
`echo&#39;, to enable backslash interpretation regardless of which shell you
use.</p>
<pre class="example">
  &#34;pipe\tOpen Files\tlsof -P -p %d 2&gt;&amp;1&#34; &gt;&gt; ~/.toprc
  &#34;file\tNUMA Info\t/proc/%d/numa_maps&#34; &gt;&gt; ~/.toprc
  &#34;pipe\tLog\ttail -n200 /var/log/syslog | sort -Mr&#34; &gt;&gt; ~/.toprc
</pre>
<p>
If any inspect entry you create produces output with unprintable
characters they will be displayed in either the ^C notation or
hexadecimal &lt;FF&gt; form, depending on their value. This applies to tab
characters as well, which will show as `^I&#39;. If you want a truer
representation, any embedded tabs should be expanded. The following
example takes what could have been a `file&#39; entry but employs a `pipe&#39;
instead so as to expand the embedded tabs.</p>
<pre class="example">
  # next would have contained `\t&#39; ...
  # file ^I &lt;your_name&gt; ^I /proc/%d/status
  # but this will eliminate embedded `\t&#39; ...
  pipe ^I &lt;your_name&gt; ^I cat /proc/%d/status | expand -
</pre>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: Some programs might rely on <em>SIGINT</em> to end. Therefore, if a
`*pipe*&#39; such as the following is established, one must use Ctrl-C to
terminate it in order to review the results. This is the single occasion
where a `^C&#39; will not also terminate .</p>
<pre class="example">
  pipe ^I Trace ^I /usr/bin/strace -p %d 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre>
<p>
Lastly, while `*pipe*&#39; type entries have been discussed in terms of
pipelines and commands, there is nothing to prevent you from including /
shell scripts/ as well. Perhaps even newly created scripts designed
specifically for the `Y&#39; interactive command.</p>
<p>
For example, as the number of your Inspect entries grows over time, the
`Options:&#39; row will be truncated when screen width is exceeded. That
does not affect operation other than to make some selections invisible.
However, if some choices are lost to truncation but you want to see more
options, there is an easy solution hinted at below.</p>
<pre class="example">
  Inspection Pause at pid ...
  Use:  left/right then &lt;Enter&gt; ...
  Options:  help  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11 ...
</pre>
<p>
The entries in the rcfile would have a number for the `.name&#39; element
and the `help&#39; entry would identify a shell script you&#39;ve written
explaining what those numbered selections actually mean. In that way,
many more choices can be made visible.</p>

7. STUPID TRICKS Sampler
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-32" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Many of these tricks work best when you give a scheduling boost. So plan
on starting him with a nice value of -10, assuming you&#39;ve got the
authority.</p>

7a. Kernel Magic
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-33" class="outline-text-3">
<p>For these stupid tricks, needs full-screen mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>The user interface, through prompts and help, intentionally implies
that the delay interval is limited to tenths of a second. However,
you&#39;re free to set any desired delay. If you want to see Linux at his
scheduling best, try a delay of .09 seconds or less.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this experiment, under x-windows open an xterm and maximize it. Then
do the following:</p>
<pre class="example">
  . provide a scheduling boost and tiny delay via:
      nice -n -10  -d.09
  . keep sorted column highlighting  so as to
    minimize path length
  . turn On reverse row highlighting for emphasis
  . try various sort columns (TIME/MEM work well),
    and normal or reverse sorts to bring the most
    active processes into view
</pre>
<p>
What you&#39;ll see is a very busy Linux doing what he&#39;s always done for
you, but there was no program available to illustrate this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Under an xterm using `white-on-black&#39; colors, on &#39;s Color Mapping
screen set the task color to black and be sure that task highlighting
is set to bold, not reverse. Then set the delay interval to around .3
seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>After bringing the most active processes into view, what you&#39;ll see are
the ghostly images of just the currently running tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete the existing rcfile, or create a new symlink. Start this new
version then type `T&#39; (a secret key, see topic 4c. Task Area Commands,
SORTING) followed by `W&#39; and `q&#39;. Finally, restart the program with
-d0 (zero delay).</li>
</ul>
<p>Your display will be refreshed at three times the rate of the former , a
300% speed advantage. As climbs the TIME ladder, be as patient as you
can while speculating on whether or not will ever reach the .</p>

7b. Bouncing Windows
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-34" class="outline-text-3">
<p>For these stupid tricks, needs alternate-display mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>With 3 or 4 task displays visible, pick any window other than the last
and turn idle processes using the `i&#39; command toggle. Depending on
where you applied `i&#39;, sometimes several task displays are bouncing
and sometimes it&#39;s like an accordion, as tries his best to allocate
space.</li>
<li>Set each window&#39;s summary lines differently: one with no memory (`m&#39;);
another with no states (`t&#39;); maybe one with nothing at all, just the
message line. Then hold down `a&#39; or `w&#39; and watch a variation on
bouncing windows hopping windows.</li>
<li>Display all 4 windows and for each, in turn, set idle processes to
using the `i&#39; command toggle. You&#39;ve just entered the &#34;extreme bounce&#34;
zone.</li>

7c. The Big Bird Window
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-35" class="outline-text-3">
<p>This stupid trick also requires alternate-display mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>Display all 4 windows and make sure that 1:Def is the `current&#39;
window. Then, keep increasing window size with the `n&#39; interactive
command until all the other task displays are &#34;pushed out of the
nest&#34;.</li>
</ul>
<p>When they&#39;ve all been displaced, toggle between all visible/invisible
windows using the `_&#39; command toggle. Then ponder this:<br>
is fibbing or telling honestly your imposed truth?</p>

7d. The Ol&#39; Switcheroo
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-36" class="outline-text-3">
<p>This stupid trick works best without alternate-display mode, since
justification is active on a per window basis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start and make COMMAND the last (rightmost) column displayed. If
necessary, use the `c&#39; command toggle to display command lines and
ensure that forest view mode is active with the `V&#39; command toggle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then use the up/down arrow keys to position the display so that some
truncated command lines are shown (`+&#39; in last position). You may have
to resize your xterm to produce truncation.</p>
<p>
Lastly, use the `j&#39; command toggle to make the COMMAND column right
justified.</p>
<p>
Now use the right arrow key to reach the COMMAND column. Continuing with
the right arrow key, watch closely the direction of travel for the
command lines being shown.</p>
<p>
\\
some lines travel left, while others travel right</p>
<p>
eventually all lines will Switcheroo, and move right</p>
