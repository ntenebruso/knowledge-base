The &#34;quickref&#34; help section is a condensed reference of editor features:</p>

If you are new to Vim/Nvim, start with the 30-minute tutorial:</p>

<p>
Recovery mode. If</p>

independently from instances of</p>

Execute Lua</p>
<p>

is,</p>
<p>
stops processing of Nvim arguments.</p>
<p>
Execute</p>
<p>
after the first file argument has been read. If</p>

Dump API metadata serialized to msgpack and exit.</p>
<p>
Use standard input and standard output as a msgpack-rpc channel. :help
–embed</p>
<p>
Do not start a UI. When supplied with –embed this implies that the
embedding application does not intend to (immediately) start a UI. Also
useful for &#34;scraping&#34; messages in a pipe. :help –headless</p>
