DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Traditionally, tips of branches and tags (collectively known as <em>refs</em>)
were stored one file per ref in a (sub)directory under <strong>$GIT_DIR/refs</strong>
directory. While many branch tips tend to be updated often, most tags
and some branch tips are never updated. When a repository has hundreds
or thousands of tags, this one-file-per-ref format both wastes storage
and hurts performance.</p>
<p>
This command is used to solve the storage and performance problem by
storing the refs in a single file, <strong>$GIT_DIR/packed-refs</strong>. When a ref is
missing from the traditional <strong>$GIT_DIR/refs</strong> directory hierarchy, it is
looked up in this file and used if found.</p>
<p>
Subsequent updates to branches always create new files under
<strong>$GIT_DIR/refs</strong> directory hierarchy.</p>
<p>
A recommended practice to deal with a repository with too many refs is
to pack its refs with <strong>–all</strong> once, and occasionally run <strong>git
pack-refs</strong>. Tags are by definition stationary and are not expected to
change. Branch heads will be packed with the initial <strong>pack-refs –all</strong>,
but only the currently active branch heads will become unpacked, and the
next <strong>pack-refs</strong> (without <strong>–all</strong>) will leave them unpacked.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>–all</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The command by default packs all tags and refs that are already packed,
and leaves other refs alone. This is because branches are expected to be
actively developed and packing their tips does not help performance.
This option causes all refs to be packed as well, with the exception of
hidden refs, broken refs, and symbolic refs. Useful for a repository
with many branches of historical interests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-prune</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The command usually removes loose refs under <strong>$GIT_DIR/refs</strong> hierarchy
after packing them. This option tells it not to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–auto</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pack refs as needed depending on the current state of the ref database.
The behavior depends on the ref format used by the repository and may
change in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
&#34;files&#34;: No special handling for <strong>–auto</strong> has been implemented.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
&#34;reftable&#34;: Tables are compacted such that they form a geometric
sequence. For two tables N and N+1, where N+1 is newer, this maintains
the property that N is at least twice as big as N+1. Only tables that
violate this property are compacted.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
–include &lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pack refs based on a <strong>glob(7)</strong> pattern. Repetitions of this option
accumulate inclusion patterns. If a ref is both included in <strong>–include</strong>
and <strong>–exclude</strong>, <strong>–exclude</strong> takes precedence. Using <strong>–include</strong> will
preclude all tags from being included by default. Symbolic refs and
broken refs will never be packed. When used with <strong>–all</strong>, it will be a
noop. Use <strong>–no-include</strong> to clear and reset the list of patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–exclude &lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not pack refs matching the given <strong>glob(7)</strong> pattern. Repetitions of
this option accumulate exclusion patterns. Use <strong>–no-exclude</strong> to clear
and reset the list of patterns. If a ref is already packed, including it
with <strong>–exclude</strong> will not unpack it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
When used with <strong>–all</strong>, pack only loose refs which do not match any of
the provided <strong>–exclude</strong> patterns.</p>
<p>
When used with <strong>–include</strong>, refs provided to <strong>–include</strong>, minus refs
that are provided to <strong>–exclude</strong> will be packed.</p>

BUGS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Older documentation written before the packed-refs mechanism was
introduced may still say things like &#34;.git/refs/heads/&lt;branch&gt; file
exists&#34; when it means &#34;branch &lt;branch&gt; exists&#34;.</p>
