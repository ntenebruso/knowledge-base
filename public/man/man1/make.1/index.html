DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The <em>make</em> utility will determine automatically which pieces of a large
program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile them.
The manual describes the GNU implementation of <strong>make</strong>, which was written
by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is currently maintained by
Paul Smith. Our examples show C programs, since they are very common,
but you can use <strong>make</strong> with any programming language whose compiler can
be run with a shell command. In fact, <strong>make</strong> is not limited to programs.
You can use it to describe any task where some files must be updated
automatically from others whenever the others change.</p>
<p>
To prepare to use <strong>make</strong>, you must write a file called the <em>makefile</em>
that describes the relationships among files in your program, and
provides commands for updating each file. In a program, typically the
executable file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by
compiling source files.</p>
<p>
Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files,
this simple shell command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>make</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
suffices to perform all necessary recompilations. The <strong>make</strong> program
uses the makefile description and the last-modification times of the
files to decide which of the files need to be updated. For each of those
files, it issues the commands recorded in the makefile.</p>
<p>
<strong>make</strong> executes commands in the <em>makefile</em> to update one or more
<em>targets</em>, where <em>target</em> is typically a program. If no <strong>-f</strong> option is
present, <strong>make</strong> will look for the makefiles <em>GNUmakefile</em>, <em>makefile</em>,
and <em>Makefile</em>, in that order.</p>
<p>
Normally you should call your makefile either <em>makefile</em> or <em>Makefile</em>.
(We recommend <em>Makefile</em> because it appears prominently near the
beginning of a directory listing, right near other important files such
as <em>README</em>.) The first name checked, <em>GNUmakefile</em>, is not recommended
for most makefiles. You should use this name if you have a makefile that
is specific to GNU Make, and will not be understood by other versions of
<strong>make</strong>. If <em>makefile</em> is &#39;-&#39;, the standard input is read.</p>
<p>
<strong>make</strong> updates a target if it depends on prerequisite files that have
been modified since the target was last modified, or if the target does
not exist.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-b</strong>, <strong>-m</strong>
</dt>
<dd>These options are ignored for compatibility with other
versions of <strong>make</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-B</strong>, <strong>–always-make</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Unconditionally make all targets.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-C</strong> <em>dir</em>, *–directory*=/dir/
</dt>
<dd>Change to directory <em>dir</em> before
reading the makefiles or doing anything else. If multiple <strong>-C</strong> options
are specified, each is interpreted relative to the previous one: *-C
<strong>/ *-C *etc is equivalent to *-C */etc. This is typically used with
recursive invocations of *make</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-d</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print debugging information in addition to normal processing.
The debugging information says which files are being considered for
remaking, which file-times are being compared and with what results,
which files actually need to be remade, which implicit rules are
considered and which are applied—everything interesting about how
<strong>make</strong> decides what to do.</dd>
<dt>
*–debug*/[=FLAGS]/
</dt>
<dd>Print debugging information in addition to
normal processing. If the <em>FLAGS</em> are omitted, then the behavior is
the same as if <strong>-d</strong> was specified. <em>FLAGS</em> may be any or all of the
following names, comma- or space-separated. Only the first character
is significant: the rest may be omitted: <em>all</em> for all debugging
output (same as using <strong>-d</strong>), <em>basic</em> for basic debugging, <em>verbose</em>
for more verbose basic debugging, <em>implicit</em> for showing implicit rule
search operations, <em>jobs</em> for details on invocation of commands,
<em>makefile</em> for debugging while remaking makefiles, <em>print</em> shows all
recipes that are run even if they are silent, and <em>why</em> shows the
reason <strong>make</strong> decided to rebuild each target. Use <em>none</em> to disable
all previous debugging flags.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-e</strong>, <strong>–environment-overrides</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Give variables taken from the
environment precedence over variables from makefiles.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-E</strong> <em>string</em>, <strong>–eval</strong> <em>string</em>
</dt>
<dd>Interpret <em>string</em> using the
<strong>eval</strong> function, before parsing any makefiles.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-f</strong> <em>file</em>, *–file*=/file/, *–makefile*=/FILE/
</dt>
<dd>Use <em>file</em> as a
makefile.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-i</strong>, <strong>–ignore-errors</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Ignore all errors in commands executed to
remake files.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-I</strong> <em>dir</em>, *–include-dir*=/dir/
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a directory <em>dir</em> to
search for included makefiles. If several <strong>-I</strong> options are used to
specify several directories, the directories are searched in the order
specified. Unlike the arguments to other flags of <strong>make</strong>, directories
given with <strong>-I</strong> flags may come directly after the flag: <strong>-I*/dir/ is
allowed, as well as *-I</strong> <em>dir</em>. This syntax is allowed for
compatibility with the C preprocessor&#39;s <strong>-I</strong> flag.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-j</strong> [/jobs/], <strong>–jobs</strong>[=/jobs/]
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the number of <em>jobs</em>
(commands) to run simultaneously. If there is more than one <strong>-j</strong>
option, the last one is effective. If the <strong>-j</strong> option is given without
an argument, <strong>make</strong> will not limit the number of jobs that can run
simultaneously.</dd>
<dt>
*–jobserver-style=*/style/
</dt>
<dd>The style of jobserver to use. The
<em>style</em> may be one of <strong>fifo</strong>, <strong>pipe</strong>, or <strong>sem</strong> (Windows only).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-k</strong>, <strong>–keep-going</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Continue as much as possible after an error.
While the target that failed, and those that depend on it, cannot be
remade, the other dependencies of these targets can be processed all
the same.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-l</strong> [/load/], <strong>–load-average</strong>[=/load/]
</dt>
<dd>Specifies that no new jobs
(commands) should be started if there are others jobs running and the
load average is at least <em>load</em> (a floating-point number). With no
argument, removes a previous load limit.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-L</strong>, <strong>–check-symlink-times</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use the latest mtime between symlinks
and target.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-n</strong>, <strong>–just-print</strong>, <strong>–dry-run</strong>, <strong>–recon</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print the commands
that would be executed, but do not execute them (except in certain
circumstances).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-o</strong> <em>file</em>, *–old-file*=/file/, *–assume-old*=/file/
</dt>
<dd>Do not
remake the file <em>file</em> even if it is older than its dependencies, and
do not remake anything on account of changes in <em>file</em>. Essentially
the file is treated as very old and its rules are ignored.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-O</strong>[/type/], <strong>–output-sync</strong>[=/type/]
</dt>
<dd>When running multiple jobs
in parallel with <strong>-j</strong>, ensure the output of each job is collected
together rather than interspersed with output from other jobs. If
<em>type</em> is not specified or is <strong>target</strong> the output from the entire
recipe for each target is grouped together. If <em>type</em> is <strong>line</strong> the
output from each command line within a recipe is grouped together. If
<em>type</em> is <strong>recurse</strong> output from an entire recursive make is grouped
together. If <em>type</em> is <strong>none</strong> output synchronization is disabled.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-p</strong>, <strong>–print-data-base</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print the data base (rules and variable
values) that results from reading the makefiles; then execute as usual
or as otherwise specified. This also prints the version information
given by the <strong>-v</strong> switch (see below). To print the data base without
trying to remake any files, use <em>make -p -f/dev/null</em>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-q</strong>, <strong>–question</strong>
</dt>
<dd>``Question mode&#39;&#39;. Do not run any commands, or
print anything; just return an exit status that is zero if the
specified targets are already up to date, nonzero otherwise.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-r</strong>, <strong>–no-builtin-rules</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Eliminate use of the built-in implicit
rules. Also clear out the default list of suffixes for suffix rules.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-R</strong>, <strong>–no-builtin-variables</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t define any built-in variables.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-s</strong>, <strong>–silent</strong>, <strong>–quiet</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Silent operation; do not print the
commands as they are executed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-silent</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Cancel the effect of the <strong>-s</strong> option.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-S</strong>, <strong>–no-keep-going</strong>, <strong>–stop</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Cancel the effect of the <strong>-k</strong>
option.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-t</strong>, <strong>–touch</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Touch files (mark them up to date without really
changing them) instead of running their commands. This is used to
pretend that the commands were done, in order to fool future
invocations of <strong>make</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–trace</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Information about the disposition of each target is
printed (why the target is being rebuilt and what commands are run to
rebuild it).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-v</strong>, <strong>–version</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print the version of the <strong>make</strong> program plus a
copyright, a list of authors and a notice that there is no warranty.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-w</strong>, <strong>–print-directory</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print a message containing the working
directory before and after other processing. This may be useful for
tracking down errors from complicated nests of recursive <strong>make</strong>
commands.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-print-directory</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Turn off <strong>-w</strong>, even if it was turned on
implicitly.</dd>
<dt>
*–shuffle*/[=MODE]/
</dt>
<dd>Enable shuffling of goal and prerequisite
ordering. <em>MODE</em> is one of <em>none</em> to disable shuffle mode, <em>random</em> to
shuffle prerequisites in random order, <em>reverse</em> to consider
prerequisites in reverse order, or an integer <em>&lt;seed&gt;</em> which enables
<em>random</em> mode with a specific <em>seed</em> value. If <em>MODE</em> is omitted the
default is <em>random</em>.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd><strong>-W</strong> <em>file</em>, *–what-if*=/file/, *–new-file*=/file/,
<strong>–assume-new*=/file/ :: Pretend that the target <em>file</em> has just been
modified. When used with the *-n</strong> flag, this shows you what would
happen if you were to modify that file. Without <strong>-n</strong>, it is almost the
same as running a <em>touch</em> command on the given file before running
<strong>make</strong>, except that the modification time is changed only in the
imagination of <strong>make</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–warn-undefined-variables</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Warn when an undefined variable is
referenced.</dd>

EXIT STATUS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>GNU Make exits with a status of zero if all makefiles were successfully
parsed and no targets that were built failed. A status of one will be
returned if the <strong>-q</strong> flag was used and <strong>make</strong> determines that a target
needs to be rebuilt. A status of two will be returned if any errors were
encountered.</p>
