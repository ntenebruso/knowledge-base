DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Show changes between the working tree and the index or a tree, changes
between the index and a tree, changes between two trees, changes
resulting from a merge, changes between two blob objects, or changes
between two files on disk.</p>
<p>
<em>git diff</em> [&lt;options&gt;] [–] [&lt;path&gt;…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This form is to view the changes you made relative to the index (staging
area for the next commit). In other words, the differences are what you
<em>could</em> tell Git to further add to the index but you still haven&#39;t. You
can stage these changes by using *git-add*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>git diff</em> [&lt;options&gt;] –no-index [–] &lt;path&gt; &lt;path&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This form is to compare the given two paths on the filesystem. You can
omit the <strong>–no-index</strong> option when running the command in a working tree
controlled by Git and at least one of the paths points outside the
working tree, or when running the command outside a working tree
controlled by Git. This form implies <strong>–exit-code</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>git diff</em> [&lt;options&gt;] –cached [–merge-base] [&lt;commit&gt;] [–]
[&lt;path&gt;…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This form is to view the changes you staged for the next commit relative
to the named &lt;commit&gt;. Typically you would want comparison with the
latest commit, so if you do not give &lt;commit&gt;, it defaults to HEAD. If
HEAD does not exist (e.g. unborn branches) and &lt;commit&gt; is not given, it
shows all staged changes. –staged is a synonym of –cached.</p>
<p>
If –merge-base is given, instead of using &lt;commit&gt;, use the merge base
of &lt;commit&gt; and HEAD. <strong>git diff –cached –merge-base A</strong> is equivalent
to <strong>git diff –cached $(git merge-base A HEAD)</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>git diff</em> [&lt;options&gt;] [–merge-base] &lt;commit&gt; [–] [&lt;path&gt;…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This form is to view the changes you have in your working tree relative
to the named &lt;commit&gt;. You can use HEAD to compare it with the latest
commit, or a branch name to compare with the tip of a different branch.</p>
<p>
If –merge-base is given, instead of using &lt;commit&gt;, use the merge base
of &lt;commit&gt; and HEAD. <strong>git diff –merge-base A</strong> is equivalent to <strong>git
diff $(git merge-base A HEAD)</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>git diff</em> [&lt;options&gt;] [–merge-base] &lt;commit&gt; &lt;commit&gt; [–] [&lt;path&gt;…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is to view the changes between two arbitrary &lt;commit&gt;.</p>
<p>
If –merge-base is given, use the merge base of the two commits for the
&#34;before&#34; side. <strong>git diff –merge-base A B</strong> is equivalent to <strong>git diff
$(git merge-base A B) B</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>git diff</em> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;commit&gt; &lt;commit&gt;… &lt;commit&gt; [–] [&lt;path&gt;…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This form is to view the results of a merge commit. The first listed
&lt;commit&gt; must be the merge itself; the remaining two or more commits
should be its parents. Convenient ways to produce the desired set of
revisions are to use the suffixes <strong>^@</strong> and <strong>^!</strong>. If A is a merge commit,
then <strong>git diff A A^@</strong>, <strong>git diff A^!</strong> and <strong>git show A</strong> all give the same
combined diff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>git diff</em> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;commit&gt;..&lt;commit&gt; [–] [&lt;path&gt;…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is synonymous to the earlier form (without the <strong>..</strong>) for viewing
the changes between two arbitrary &lt;commit&gt;. If &lt;commit&gt; on one side is
omitted, it will have the same effect as using HEAD instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>git diff</em> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;commit&gt;…&lt;commit&gt; [–] [&lt;path&gt;…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This form is to view the changes on the branch containing and up to the
second &lt;commit&gt;, starting at a common ancestor of both &lt;commit&gt;. <strong>git
diff A…B</strong> is equivalent to <strong>git diff $(git merge-base A B) B</strong>. You can
omit any one of &lt;commit&gt;, which has the same effect as using HEAD
instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Just in case you are doing something exotic, it should be noted that all
of the &lt;commit&gt; in the above description, except in the <strong>–merge-base</strong>
case and in the last two forms that use <strong>..</strong> notations, can be any
&lt;tree&gt;. A tree of interest is the one pointed to by the ref named
<strong>AUTO_MERGE</strong>, which is written by the <em>ort</em> merge strategy upon hitting
merge conflicts (see <strong>git-merge*(1)). Comparing the working tree with
*AUTO_MERGE</strong> shows changes you&#39;ve made so far to resolve textual
conflicts (see the examples below).</p>
<p>
For a more complete list of ways to spell &lt;commit&gt;, see &#34;SPECIFYING
REVISIONS&#34; section in *gitrevisions*(7). However, &#34;diff&#34; is about
comparing two <em>endpoints</em>, not ranges, and the range notations
(<strong>&lt;commit&gt;..&lt;commit&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;commit&gt;…&lt;commit&gt;</strong>) do not mean a range as
defined in the &#34;SPECIFYING RANGES&#34; section in *gitrevisions*(7).</p>
<p>
<em>git diff</em> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;blob&gt; &lt;blob&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This form is to view the differences between the raw contents of two
blob objects.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>-p, -u, –patch</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generate patch (see the section called “GENERATING PATCH TEXT WITH -P”).
This is the default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-s, –no-patch</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppress all output from the diff machinery. Useful for commands like
<strong>git show</strong> that show the patch by default to squelch their output, or to
cancel the effect of options like <strong>–patch</strong>, <strong>–stat</strong> earlier on the
command line in an alias.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-U&lt;n&gt;, –unified=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generate diffs with &lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of the usual three.
Implies <strong>–patch</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–output=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output to a specific file instead of stdout.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–output-indicator-new=&lt;char&gt;, –output-indicator-old=&lt;char&gt;,
–output-indicator-context=&lt;char&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the character used to indicate new, old or context lines in the
generated patch. Normally they are <em>+</em>, <em>-</em> and respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–raw</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generate the diff in raw format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–patch-with-raw</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synonym for <strong>-p –raw</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–indent-heuristic</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable the heuristic that shifts diff hunk boundaries to make patches
easier to read. This is the default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-indent-heuristic</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disable the indent heuristic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–minimal</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is produced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–patience</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generate a diff using the &#34;patience diff&#34; algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–histogram</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generate a diff using the &#34;histogram diff&#34; algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–anchored=&lt;text&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generate a diff using the &#34;anchored diff&#34; algorithm.</p>
<p>
This option may be specified more than once.</p>
<p>
If a line exists in both the source and destination, exists only once,
and starts with this text, this algorithm attempts to prevent it from
appearing as a deletion or addition in the output. It uses the &#34;patience
diff&#34; algorithm internally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–diff-algorithm={patience|minimal|histogram|myers}</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Choose a diff algorithm. The variants are as follows:</p>
<p>
<strong>default</strong>, <strong>myers</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>minimal</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is produced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>patience</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use &#34;patience diff&#34; algorithm when generating patches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>histogram</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to &#34;support low-occurrence
common elements&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For instance, if you configured the <strong>diff.algorithm</strong> variable to a
non-default value and want to use the default one, then you have to use
<strong>–diff-algorithm=default</strong> option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–stat[=&lt;width&gt;[,&lt;name-width&gt;[,&lt;count&gt;]]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generate a diffstat. By default, as much space as necessary will be used
for the filename part, and the rest for the graph part. Maximum width
defaults to terminal width, or 80 columns if not connected to a
terminal, and can be overridden by <strong>&lt;width&gt;</strong>. The width of the filename
part can be limited by giving another width <strong>&lt;name-width&gt;</strong> after a comma
or by setting <strong>diff.statNameWidth=&lt;width&gt;</strong>. The width of the graph part
can be limited by using <strong>–stat-graph-width=&lt;width&gt;</strong> or by setting
<strong>diff.statGraphWidth=&lt;width&gt;</strong>. Using <strong>–stat</strong> or <strong>–stat-graph-width</strong>
affects all commands generating a stat graph, while setting
<strong>diff.statNameWidth</strong> or <strong>diff.statGraphWidth</strong> does not affect <strong>git
format-patch</strong>. By giving a third parameter <strong>&lt;count&gt;</strong>, you can limit the
output to the first <strong>&lt;count&gt;</strong> lines, followed by <strong>…</strong> if there are
more.</p>
<p>
These parameters can also be set individually with
<strong>–stat-width=&lt;width&gt;</strong>, <strong>–stat-name-width=&lt;name-width&gt;</strong> and
<strong>–stat-count=&lt;count&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–compact-summary</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output a condensed summary of extended header information such as file
creations or deletions (&#34;new&#34; or &#34;gone&#34;, optionally &#34;+l&#34; if it&#39;s a
symlink) and mode changes (&#34;+x&#34; or &#34;-x&#34; for adding or removing
executable bit respectively) in diffstat. The information is put between
the filename part and the graph part. Implies <strong>–stat</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–numstat</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similar to <strong>–stat</strong>, but shows number of added and deleted lines in
decimal notation and pathname without abbreviation, to make it more
machine friendly. For binary files, outputs two <strong>-</strong> instead of saying <strong>0
0</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–shortstat</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output only the last line of the <strong>–stat</strong> format containing total number
of modified files, as well as number of added and deleted lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-X[&lt;param1,param2,…&gt;], –dirstat[=&lt;param1,param2,…&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output the distribution of relative amount of changes for each
sub-directory. The behavior of <strong>–dirstat</strong> can be customized by passing
it a comma separated list of parameters. The defaults are controlled by
the <strong>diff.dirstat</strong> configuration variable (see *git-config*(1)). The
following parameters are available:</p>
<p>
<strong>changes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have been removed
from the source, or added to the destination. This ignores the amount of
pure code movements within a file. In other words, rearranging lines in
a file is not counted as much as other changes. This is the default
behavior when no parameter is given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>lines</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line-based diff
analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts. (For binary files,
count 64-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no natural concept
of lines). This is a more expensive <strong>–dirstat</strong> behavior than the
<strong>changes</strong> behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a file as
much as other changes. The resulting output is consistent with what you
get from the other <strong>–*stat</strong> options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>files</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files changed.
Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis. This is the
computationally cheapest <strong>–dirstat</strong> behavior, since it does not have to
look at the file contents at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>cumulative</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory as well.
Note that when using <strong>cumulative</strong>, the sum of the percentages reported
may exceed 100%. The default (non-cumulative) behavior can be specified
with the <strong>noncumulative</strong> parameter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;limit&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by default).
Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes are
not shown in the output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring
directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and
accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
<strong>–dirstat=files,10,cumulative</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–cumulative</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synonym for –dirstat=cumulative</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–dirstat-by-file[=&lt;param1,param2&gt;…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synonym for –dirstat=files,&lt;param1&gt;,&lt;param2&gt;…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–summary</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output a condensed summary of extended header information such as
creations, renames and mode changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–patch-with-stat</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synonym for <strong>-p –stat</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-z</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <strong>–raw</strong>, <strong>–numstat</strong>, <strong>–name-only</strong> or <strong>–name-status</strong> has been
given, do not munge pathnames and use NULs as output field terminators.</p>
<p>
Without this option, pathnames with &#34;unusual&#34; characters are quoted as
explained for the configuration variable <strong>core.quotePath</strong> (see
*git-config*(1)).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–name-only</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show only the name of each changed file in the post-image tree. The file
names are often encoded in UTF-8. For more information see the
discussion about encoding in the *git-log*(1) manual page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–name-status</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show only the name(s) and status of each changed file. See the
description of the <strong>–diff-filter</strong> option on what the status letters
mean. Just like <strong>–name-only</strong> the file names are often encoded in UTF-8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–submodule[=&lt;format&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify how differences in submodules are shown. When specifying
<strong>–submodule=short</strong> the <em>short</em> format is used. This format just shows
the names of the commits at the beginning and end of the range. When
<strong>–submodule</strong> or <strong>–submodule=log</strong> is specified, the <em>log</em> format is
used. This format lists the commits in the range like <strong>git-submodule*(1)
*summary</strong> does. When <strong>–submodule=diff</strong> is specified, the <em>diff</em> format
is used. This format shows an inline diff of the changes in the
submodule contents between the commit range. Defaults to
<strong>diff.submodule</strong> or the <em>short</em> format if the config option is unset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–color[=&lt;when&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show colored diff. <strong>–color</strong> (i.e. without <em>=&lt;when&gt;</em>) is the same as
<strong>–color=always</strong>. <em>&lt;when&gt;</em> can be one of <strong>always</strong>, <strong>never</strong>, or <strong>auto</strong>.
It can be changed by the <strong>color.ui</strong> and <strong>color.diff</strong> configuration
settings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-color</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn off colored diff. This can be used to override configuration
settings. It is the same as <strong>–color=never</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–color-moved[=&lt;mode&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moved lines of code are colored differently. It can be changed by the
<strong>diff.colorMoved</strong> configuration setting. The &lt;mode&gt; defaults to <em>no</em> if
the option is not given and to <em>zebra</em> if the option with no mode is
given. The mode must be one of:</p>
<p>
no</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moved lines are not highlighted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
default</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is a synonym for <strong>zebra</strong>. This may change to a more sensible mode in the
future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
plain</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any line that is added in one location and was removed in another
location will be colored with <em>color.diff.newMoved</em>. Similarly
<em>color.diff.oldMoved</em> will be used for removed lines that are added
somewhere else in the diff. This mode picks up any moved line, but it is
not very useful in a review to determine if a block of code was moved
without permutation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
blocks</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blocks of moved text of at least 20 alphanumeric characters are detected
greedily. The detected blocks are painted using either the
<em>color.diff.{old,new}Moved</em> color. Adjacent blocks cannot be told apart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
zebra</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blocks of moved text are detected as in <em>blocks</em> mode. The blocks are
painted using either the <em>color.diff.{old,new}Moved</em> color or
<em>color.diff.{old,new}MovedAlternative</em>. The change between the two
colors indicates that a new block was detected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
dimmed-zebra</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similar to <em>zebra</em>, but additional dimming of uninteresting parts of
moved code is performed. The bordering lines of two adjacent blocks are
considered interesting, the rest is uninteresting. <strong>dimmed_zebra</strong> is a
deprecated synonym.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-color-moved</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn off move detection. This can be used to override configuration
settings. It is the same as <strong>–color-moved=no</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–color-moved-ws=&lt;modes&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This configures how whitespace is ignored when performing the move
detection for <strong>–color-moved</strong>. It can be set by the <strong>diff.colorMovedWS</strong>
configuration setting. These modes can be given as a comma separated
list:</p>
<p>
no</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not ignore whitespace when performing move detection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
ignore-space-at-eol</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
ignore-space-change</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore changes in amount of whitespace. This ignores whitespace at line
end, and considers all other sequences of one or more whitespace
characters to be equivalent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
ignore-all-space</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores differences even if
one line has whitespace where the other line has none.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
allow-indentation-change</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Initially ignore any whitespace in the move detection, then group the
moved code blocks only into a block if the change in whitespace is the
same per line. This is incompatible with the other modes.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-color-moved-ws</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not ignore whitespace when performing move detection. This can be
used to override configuration settings. It is the same as
<strong>–color-moved-ws=no</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–word-diff[=&lt;mode&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show a word diff, using the &lt;mode&gt; to delimit changed words. By default,
words are delimited by whitespace; see <strong>–word-diff-regex</strong> below. The
&lt;mode&gt; defaults to <em>plain</em>, and must be one of:</p>
<p>
color</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Highlight changed words using only colors. Implies <strong>–color</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
plain</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show words as <strong>[-removed-]</strong> and <strong>{<del>added</del>}</strong>. Makes no attempts to escape
the delimiters if they appear in the input, so the output may be
ambiguous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
porcelain</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use a special line-based format intended for script consumption.
Added/removed/unchanged runs are printed in the usual unified diff
format, starting with a <strong>+*/</strong>-*/` ` character at the beginning of the
line and extending to the end of the line. Newlines in the input are
represented by a tilde <strong>~</strong> on a line of its own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
none</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disable word diff again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that despite the name of the first mode, color is used to highlight
the changed parts in all modes if enabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–word-diff-regex=&lt;regex&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use &lt;regex&gt; to decide what a word is, instead of considering runs of
non-whitespace to be a word. Also implies <strong>–word-diff</strong> unless it was
already enabled.</p>
<p>
Every non-overlapping match of the &lt;regex&gt; is considered a word.
Anything between these matches is considered whitespace and ignored(!)
for the purposes of finding differences. You may want to append
<strong>|[^[:space:]]</strong> to your regular expression to make sure that it matches
all non-whitespace characters. A match that contains a newline is
silently truncated(!) at the newline.</p>
<p>
For example, <strong>–word-diff-regex=.</strong> will treat each character as a word
and, correspondingly, show differences character by character.</p>
<p>
The regex can also be set via a diff driver or configuration option, see
*gitattributes*(5) or *git-config*(1). Giving it explicitly overrides
any diff driver or configuration setting. Diff drivers override
configuration settings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–color-words[=&lt;regex&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Equivalent to <strong>–word-diff=color</strong> plus (if a regex was specified)
<strong>–word-diff-regex=&lt;regex&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-renames</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration file gives the
default to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]rename-empty</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether to use empty blobs as rename source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–check</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warn if changes introduce conflict markers or whitespace errors. What
are considered whitespace errors is controlled by <strong>core.whitespace</strong>
configuration. By default, trailing whitespaces (including lines that
consist solely of whitespaces) and a space character that is immediately
followed by a tab character inside the initial indent of the line are
considered whitespace errors. Exits with non-zero status if problems are
found. Not compatible with –exit-code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ws-error-highlight=&lt;kind&gt;</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
-B[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;], –break-rewrites[=[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and create. This
serves two purposes:</p>
<p>
It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file
not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very few
lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single
deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything
new, and the number <strong>m</strong> controls this aspect of the -B option (defaults
to 60%). <strong>-B/70%</strong> specifies that less than 30% of the original should
remain in the result for Git to consider it a total rewrite (i.e.
otherwise the resulting patch will be a series of deletion and insertion
mixed together with context lines).</p>
<p>
When used with -M, a totally-rewritten file is also considered as the
source of a rename (usually -M only considers a file that disappeared as
the source of a rename), and the number <strong>n</strong> controls this aspect of the
-B option (defaults to 50%). <strong>-B20%</strong> specifies that a change with
addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file&#39;s size are
eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to another
file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-M[&lt;n&gt;], –find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Detect renames. If <strong>n</strong> is specified, it is a threshold on the similarity
index (i.e. amount of addition/deletions compared to the file&#39;s size).
For example, <strong>-M90%</strong> means Git should consider a delete/add pair to be a
rename if more than 90% of the file hasn&#39;t changed. Without a <strong>%</strong> sign,
the number is to be read as a fraction, with a decimal point before it.
I.e., <strong>-M5</strong> becomes 0.5, and is thus the same as <strong>-M50%</strong>. Similarly,
<strong>-M05</strong> is the same as <strong>-M5%</strong>. To limit detection to exact renames, use
<strong>-M100%</strong>. The default similarity index is 50%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-C[&lt;n&gt;], –find-copies[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Detect copies as well as renames. See also <strong>–find-copies-harder</strong>. If
<strong>n</strong> is specified, it has the same meaning as for <strong>-M&lt;n&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–find-copies-harder</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For performance reasons, by default, <strong>-C</strong> option finds copies only if
the original file of the copy was modified in the same changeset. This
flag makes the command inspect unmodified files as candidates for the
source of copy. This is a very expensive operation for large projects,
so use it with caution. Giving more than one <strong>-C</strong> option has the same
effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-D, –irreversible-delete</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Omit the preimage for deletes, i.e. print only the header but not the
diff between the preimage and <strong>/dev/null</strong>. The resulting patch is not
meant to be applied with <strong>patch</strong> or <strong>git apply</strong>; this is solely for
people who want to just concentrate on reviewing the text after the
change. In addition, the output obviously lacks enough information to
apply such a patch in reverse, even manually, hence the name of the
option.</p>
<p>
When used together with <strong>-B</strong>, omit also the preimage in the deletion
part of a delete/create pair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-l&lt;num&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>-M</strong> and <strong>-C</strong> options involve some preliminary steps that can detect
subsets of renames/copies cheaply, followed by an exhaustive fallback
portion that compares all remaining unpaired destinations to all
relevant sources. (For renames, only remaining unpaired sources are
relevant; for copies, all original sources are relevant.) For N sources
and destinations, this exhaustive check is O(N^2). This option prevents
the exhaustive portion of rename/copy detection from running if the
number of source/destination files involved exceeds the specified
number. Defaults to diff.renameLimit. Note that a value of 0 is treated
as unlimited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–diff-filter=[(A|C|D|M|R|T|U|X|B)…[*]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Select only files that are Added (<strong>A</strong>), Copied (<strong>C</strong>), Deleted (<strong>D</strong>),
Modified (<strong>M</strong>), Renamed (<strong>R</strong>), have their type (i.e. regular file,
symlink, submodule, …) changed (<strong>T</strong>), are Unmerged (<strong>U</strong>), are Unknown
(<strong>X</strong>), or have had their pairing Broken (<strong>B</strong>). Any combination of the
filter characters (including none) can be used. When <strong>*</strong> (All-or-none)
is added to the combination, all paths are selected if there is any file
that matches other criteria in the comparison; if there is no file that
matches other criteria, nothing is selected.</p>
<p>
Also, these upper-case letters can be downcased to exclude. E.g.
<strong>–diff-filter=ad</strong> excludes added and deleted paths.</p>
<p>
Note that not all diffs can feature all types. For instance, copied and
renamed entries cannot appear if detection for those types is disabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-S&lt;string&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look for differences that change the number of occurrences of the
specified string (i.e. addition/deletion) in a file. Intended for the
scripter&#39;s use.</p>
<p>
It is useful when you&#39;re looking for an exact block of code (like a
struct), and want to know the history of that block since it first came
into being: use the feature iteratively to feed the interesting block in
the preimage back into <strong>-S</strong>, and keep going until you get the very first
version of the block.</p>
<p>
Binary files are searched as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-G&lt;regex&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look for differences whose patch text contains added/removed lines that
match &lt;regex&gt;.</p>
<p>
To illustrate the difference between <strong>-S&lt;regex&gt; –pickaxe-regex</strong> and
<strong>-G&lt;regex&gt;</strong>, consider a commit with the following diff in the same file:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
+    return frotz(nitfol, two-&gt;ptr, 1, 0);
...
-    hit = frotz(nitfol, mf2.ptr, 1, 0);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
While <strong>git log -G&#34;frotz\(nitfol&#34;</strong> will show this commit, <strong>git log
-S&#34;frotz\(nitfol&#34; –pickaxe-regex</strong> will not (because the number of
occurrences of that string did not change).</p>
<p>
Unless <strong>–text</strong> is supplied patches of binary files without a textconv
filter will be ignored.</p>
<p>
See the <em>pickaxe</em> entry in *gitdiffcore*(7) for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–find-object=&lt;object-id&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look for differences that change the number of occurrences of the
specified object. Similar to <strong>-S</strong>, just the argument is different in
that it doesn&#39;t search for a specific string but for a specific object
id.</p>
<p>
The object can be a blob or a submodule commit. It implies the <strong>-t</strong>
option in <strong>git-log</strong> to also find trees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–pickaxe-all</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <strong>-S</strong> or <strong>-G</strong> finds a change, show all the changes in that
changeset, not just the files that contain the change in &lt;string&gt;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–pickaxe-regex</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Treat the &lt;string&gt; given to <strong>-S</strong> as an extended POSIX regular expression
to match.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-O&lt;orderfile&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Control the order in which files appear in the output. This overrides
the <strong>diff.orderFile</strong> configuration variable (see <strong>git-config*(1)). To
cancel *diff.orderFile</strong>, use <strong>-O/dev/null</strong>.</p>
<p>
The output order is determined by the order of glob patterns in
&lt;orderfile&gt;. All files with pathnames that match the first pattern are
output first, all files with pathnames that match the second pattern
(but not the first) are output next, and so on. All files with pathnames
that do not match any pattern are output last, as if there was an
implicit match-all pattern at the end of the file. If multiple pathnames
have the same rank (they match the same pattern but no earlier
patterns), their output order relative to each other is the normal
order.</p>
<p>
&lt;orderfile&gt; is parsed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Blank lines are ignored, so they can be used as separators for
readability.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Lines starting with a hash (&#34;<strong>#</strong>&#34;) are ignored, so they can be used for
comments. Add a backslash (&#34;<strong>\</strong>&#34;) to the beginning of the pattern if it
starts with a hash.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Each other line contains a single pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Patterns have the same syntax and semantics as patterns used for
fnmatch(3) without the FNM_PATHNAME flag, except a pathname also matches
a pattern if removing any number of the final pathname components
matches the pattern. For example, the pattern &#34;<strong>foo*bar</strong>&#34; matches
&#34;<strong>fooasdfbar</strong>&#34; and &#34;<strong>foo/bar/baz/asdf</strong>&#34; but not &#34;<strong>foobarx</strong>&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–skip-to=&lt;file&gt;, –rotate-to=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discard the files before the named &lt;file&gt; from the output (i.e. <em>skip
to</em>), or move them to the end of the output (i.e. <em>rotate to</em>). These
options were invented primarily for the use of the <strong>git difftool</strong>
command, and may not be very useful otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-R</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Swap two inputs; that is, show differences from index or on-disk file to
tree contents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–relative[=&lt;path&gt;], –no-relative</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When run from a subdirectory of the project, it can be told to exclude
changes outside the directory and show pathnames relative to it with
this option. When you are not in a subdirectory (e.g. in a bare
repository), you can name which subdirectory to make the output relative
to by giving a &lt;path&gt; as an argument. <strong>–no-relative</strong> can be used to
countermand both <strong>diff.relative</strong> config option and previous
<strong>–relative</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-a, –text</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Treat all files as text.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignore-cr-at-eol</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore carriage-return at the end of line when doing a comparison.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignore-space-at-eol</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-b, –ignore-space-change</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore changes in amount of whitespace. This ignores whitespace at line
end, and considers all other sequences of one or more whitespace
characters to be equivalent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-w, –ignore-all-space</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores differences even if
one line has whitespace where the other line has none.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignore-blank-lines</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.</p>

<p>
–inter-hunk-context=&lt;lines&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified number of

<strong>diff.interHunkContext</strong> or 0 if the config option is unset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-W, –function-context</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show whole function as context lines for each change. The function names
are determined in the same way as <strong>git diff</strong> works out patch hunk
headers (see <em>Defining a custom hunk-header</em> in *gitattributes*(5)).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–exit-code</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make the program exit with codes similar to diff(1). That is, it exits
with 1 if there were differences and 0 means no differences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–quiet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disable all output of the program. Implies <strong>–exit-code</strong>. Disables
execution of external diff helpers whose exit code is not trusted, i.e.
their respective configuration option <strong>diff.trustExitCode</strong> or
<strong>diff.&lt;driver&gt;.trustExitCode</strong> or environment variable
<strong>GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF_TRUST_EXIT_CODE</strong> is false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ext-diff</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow an external diff helper to be executed. If you set an external
diff driver with *gitattributes*(5), you need to use this option with
*git-log*(1) and friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-ext-diff</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disallow external diff drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–textconv, –no-textconv</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow (or disallow) external text conversion filters to be run when
comparing binary files. See *gitattributes*(5) for details. Because
textconv filters are typically a one-way conversion, the resulting diff
is suitable for human consumption, but cannot be applied. For this
reason, textconv filters are enabled by default only for *git-diff*(1)
and *git-log*(1), but not for *git-format-patch*(1) or diff plumbing
commands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignore-submodules[=&lt;when&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation. &lt;when&gt; can be
either &#34;none&#34;, &#34;untracked&#34;, &#34;dirty&#34; or &#34;all&#34;, which is the default.
Using &#34;none&#34; will consider the submodule modified when it either
contains untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit
recorded in the superproject and can be used to override any settings of
the <em>ignore</em> option in *git-config*(1) or *gitmodules*(5). When
&#34;untracked&#34; is used submodules are not considered dirty when they only
contain untracked content (but they are still scanned for modified
content). Using &#34;dirty&#34; ignores all changes to the work tree of
submodules, only changes to the commits stored in the superproject are
shown (this was the behavior until 1.7.0). Using &#34;all&#34; hides all changes
to submodules.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By default entries added by &#34;git add -N&#34; appear as an existing empty
file in &#34;git diff&#34; and a new file in &#34;git diff –cached&#34;. This option
makes the entry appear as a new file in &#34;git diff&#34; and non-existent in

<p>The raw output format from &#34;git-diff-index&#34;, &#34;git-diff-tree&#34;,
&#34;git-diff-files&#34; and &#34;git diff –raw&#34; are very similar.</p>
<p>
These commands all compare two sets of things; what is compared differs:</p>
<p>
git-diff-index &lt;tree-ish&gt;</p>

The &#34;git-diff-tree&#34; command begins its output by printing the hash of

The sha1 for &#34;dst&#34; is shown as all 0&#39;s if a file on the filesystem is
out of sync with the index.</p>

GENERATING PATCH TEXT WITH -P
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Running <strong>git-diff*(1), *git-log*(1), *git-show*(1), *git-diff-index*(1),
*git-diff-tree*(1), or *git-diff-files*(1) with the *-p</strong> option produces
patch text. You can customize the creation of patch text via the
<strong>GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF</strong> and the <strong>GIT_DIFF_OPTS</strong> environment variables (see
<strong>git*(1)), and the *diff</strong> attribute (see *gitattributes*(5)).</p>
<p>
What the -p option produces is slightly different from the traditional
diff format:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It is preceded by a &#34;git diff&#34; header that looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
diff --git a/file1 b/file2
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <strong>a/</strong> and <strong>b/</strong> filenames are the same unless rename/copy is involved.
Especially, even for a creation or a deletion, <strong>/dev/null</strong> is <em>not</em> used
in place of the <strong>a/</strong> or <strong>b/</strong> filenames.</p>
<p>
When a rename/copy is involved, <strong>file1</strong> and <strong>file2</strong> show the name of the
source file of the rename/copy and the name of the file that the
rename/copy produces, respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It is followed by one or more extended header lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
old mode &lt;mode&gt;
new mode &lt;mode&gt;
deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt;
new file mode &lt;mode&gt;
copy from &lt;path&gt;
copy to &lt;path&gt;
rename from &lt;path&gt;
rename to &lt;path&gt;
similarity index &lt;number&gt;
dissimilarity index &lt;number&gt;
index &lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt; &lt;mode&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
File modes are printed as 6-digit octal numbers including the file type
and file permission bits.</p>
<p>
Path names in extended headers do not include the <strong>a/</strong> and <strong>b/</strong>
prefixes.</p>
<p>
The similarity index is the percentage of unchanged lines, and the
dissimilarity index is the percentage of changed lines. It is a rounded
down integer, followed by a percent sign. The similarity index value of
100% is thus reserved for two equal files, while 100% dissimilarity
means that no line from the old file made it into the new one.</p>
<p>
The index line includes the blob object names before and after the
change. The &lt;mode&gt; is included if the file mode does not change;
otherwise, separate lines indicate the old and the new mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>

<p>All the <strong>file1</strong> files in the output refer to files before the commit,

COMBINED DIFF FORMAT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Any diff-generating command can take the <strong>-c</strong> or <strong>–cc</strong> option to
produce a <em>combined diff</em> when showing a merge. This is the default
format when showing merges with <strong>git-diff*(1) or *git-show*(1). Note
also that you can give suitable *–diff-merges</strong> option to any of these
commands to force generation of diffs in a specific format.</p>
<p>
A &#34;combined diff&#34; format looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
diff --combined describe.c
index fabadb8,cc95eb0..4866510
--- a/describe.c
+++ b/describe.c
@@@ -98,20 -98,12 +98,20 @@@

        if (!initialized) {
                initialized = 1;
                for_each_ref(get_name);

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It is preceded by a &#34;git diff&#34; header, that looks like this (when the
<strong>-c</strong> option is used):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
diff --combined file
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
or like this (when the <strong>–cc</strong> option is used):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
diff --cc file
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It is followed by one or more extended header lines (this example shows
a merge with two parents):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
index &lt;hash&gt;,&lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt;
mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt;
new file mode &lt;mode&gt;
deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <strong>mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt;</strong> line appears only if at least one of
the &lt;mode&gt; is different from the rest. Extended headers with information
about detected content movement (renames and copying detection) are
designed to work with the diff of two &lt;tree-ish&gt; and are not used by
combined diff format.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It is followed by a two-line from-file/to-file header:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
--- a/file
+++ b/file
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Similar to the two-line header for the traditional <em>unified</em> diff
format, <strong>/dev/null</strong> is used to signal created or deleted files.</p>
<p>
However, if the –combined-all-paths option is provided, instead of a
two-line from-file/to-file, you get an N+1 line from-file/to-file
header, where N is the number of parents in the merge commit:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
--- a/file
--- a/file
--- a/file
+++ b/file
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This extended format can be useful if rename or copy detection is
active, to allow you to see the original name of the file in different
parents.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Chunk header format is modified to prevent people from accidentally
feeding it to <strong>patch -p1</strong>. Combined diff format was created for review
of merge commit changes, and was not meant to be applied. The change is
similar to the change in the extended <em>index</em> header:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
@@@ &lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;to-file-range&gt; @@@
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are (number of parents + 1) <strong>@</strong> characters in the chunk header for
combined diff format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Unlike the traditional <em>unified</em> diff format, which shows two files A
and B with a single column that has <strong>-</strong> (minus — appears in A but
removed in B), <strong>+</strong> (plus — missing in A but added to B), or <strong>&#34; &#34;</strong>
(space — unchanged) prefix, this format compares two or more files
file1, file2,… with one file X, and shows how X differs from each of
fileN. One column for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to
note how X&#39;s line is different from it.</p>
<p>
A <strong>-</strong> character in the column N means that the line appears in fileN but
it does not appear in the result. A <strong>+</strong> character in the column N means
that the line appears in the result, and fileN does not have that line
(in other words, the line was added, from the point of view of that
parent).</p>
<p>
In the above example output, the function signature was changed from
both files (hence two <strong>-</strong> removals from both file1 and file2, plus <strong>++</strong>
to mean one line that was added does not appear in either file1 or
file2). Also, eight other lines are the same from file1 but do not
appear in file2 (hence prefixed with <strong>+</strong>).</p>
<p>
When shown by <strong>git diff-tree -c</strong>, it compares the parents of a merge
commit with the merge result (i.e. file1..fileN are the parents). When
shown by <strong>git diff-files -c</strong>, it compares the two unresolved merge
parents with the working tree file (i.e. file1 is stage 2 aka &#34;our
version&#34;, file2 is stage 3 aka &#34;their version&#34;).</p>

OTHER DIFF FORMATS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The <strong>–summary</strong> option describes newly added, deleted, renamed and
copied files. The <strong>–stat</strong> option adds diffstat(1) graph to the output.
These options can be combined with other options, such as <strong>-p</strong>, and are
meant for human consumption.</p>
<p>
When showing a change that involves a rename or a copy, <strong>–stat</strong> output
formats the pathnames compactly by combining common prefix and suffix of
the pathnames. For example, a change that moves <strong>arch/i386/Makefile</strong> to
<strong>arch/x86/Makefile</strong> while modifying 4 lines will be shown like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
arch/{i386 =&gt; x86}/Makefile    |   4 +--
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <strong>–numstat</strong> option gives the diffstat(1) information but is designed
for easier machine consumption. An entry in <strong>–numstat</strong> output looks
like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
1       2       README
3       1       arch/{i386 =&gt; x86}/Makefile
</pre>

</ol>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>a tab;</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>

</ol>
<p>pathname (possibly with rename/copy information);</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>a newline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
When <strong>-z</strong> output option is in effect, the output is formatted this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
1       2       README NUL
3       1       NUL arch/i386/Makefile NUL arch/x86/Makefile NUL
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>the number of added lines;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>a tab;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>a NUL (only exists if renamed/copied);</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>pathname in preimage;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>a NUL (only exists if renamed/copied);</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>pathname in postimage (only exists if renamed/copied);</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>a NUL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The extra <strong>NUL</strong> before the preimage path in renamed case is to allow
scripts that read the output to tell if the current record being read is
a single-path record or a rename/copy record without reading ahead.
After reading added and deleted lines, reading up to <strong>NUL</strong> would yield
the pathname, but if that is <strong>NUL</strong>, the record will show two paths.</p>

diff.autoRefreshIndex</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When using <em>git diff</em> to compare with work tree files, do not consider
stat-only changes as changed. Instead, silently run <strong>git update-index
–refresh</strong> to update the cached stat information for paths whose
contents in the work tree match the contents in the index. This option
defaults to true. Note that this affects only <em>git diff</em> Porcelain, and
not lower level <em>diff</em> commands such as <em>git diff-files</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.dirstat</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A comma separated list of <strong>–dirstat</strong> parameters specifying the default
behavior of the <strong>–dirstat</strong> option to *git-diff*(1) and friends. The
defaults can be overridden on the command line (using
<strong>–dirstat=&lt;param1,param2,…&gt;</strong>). The fallback defaults (when not
changed by <strong>diff.dirstat</strong>) are <strong>changes,noncumulative,3</strong>. The following
parameters are available:</p>
<p>
<strong>changes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have been removed
from the source, or added to the destination. This ignores the amount of
pure code movements within a file. In other words, rearranging lines in
a file is not counted as much as other changes. This is the default
behavior when no parameter is given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>lines</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line-based diff
analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts. (For binary files,
count 64-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no natural concept
of lines). This is a more expensive <strong>–dirstat</strong> behavior than the
<strong>changes</strong> behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a file as
much as other changes. The resulting output is consistent with what you
get from the other <strong>–*stat</strong> options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>files</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files changed.
Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis. This is the
computationally cheapest <strong>–dirstat</strong> behavior, since it does not have to
look at the file contents at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>cumulative</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory as well.
Note that when using <strong>cumulative</strong>, the sum of the percentages reported
may exceed 100%. The default (non-cumulative) behavior can be specified
with the <strong>noncumulative</strong> parameter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;limit&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by default).
Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes are
not shown in the output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring
directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and
accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
<strong>files,10,cumulative</strong>.</p>

diff.statNameWidth</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the width of the filename part in –stat output. If set, applies

<p>
diff.interHunkContext</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified number of

diff.external</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this config variable is set, diff generation is not performed using
the internal diff machinery, but using the given command. Can be
overridden with the ‘GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF&#39; environment variable. The
command is called with parameters as described under &#34;git Diffs&#34; in
*git*(1). Note: if you want to use an external diff program only on a
subset of your files, you might want to use *gitattributes*(5) instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.trustExitCode</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this boolean value is set to true then the <strong>diff.external</strong> command is
expected to return exit code 0 if it considers the input files to be
equal or 1 if it considers them to be different, like <strong>diff(1)</strong>. If it
is set to false, which is the default, then the command is expected to
return exit code 0 regardless of equality. Any other exit code causes
Git to report a fatal error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.ignoreSubmodules</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets the default value of –ignore-submodules. Note that this affects
only <em>git diff</em> Porcelain, and not lower level <em>diff</em> commands such as
<em>git diff-files</em>. <em>git checkout</em> and <em>git switch</em> also honor this
setting when reporting uncommitted changes. Setting it to <em>all</em> disables
the submodule summary normally shown by <em>git commit</em> and <em>git status</em>
when <strong>status.submoduleSummary</strong> is set unless it is overridden by using
the –ignore-submodules command-line option. The <em>git submodule</em>
commands are not affected by this setting. By default this is set to
untracked so that any untracked submodules are ignored.</p>

<p>
diff.mnemonicPrefix</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set, <em>git diff</em> uses a prefix pair that is different from the

<blockquote>
<p>The number of files to consider in the exhaustive portion of copy/rename
detection; equivalent to the <em>git diff</em> option <strong>-l</strong>. If not set, the
default value is currently 1000. This setting has no effect if rename
detection is turned off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.renames</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether and how Git detects renames. If set to &#34;false&#34;, rename detection
is disabled. If set to &#34;true&#34;, basic rename detection is enabled. If set
to &#34;copies&#34; or &#34;copy&#34;, Git will detect copies, as well. Defaults to
true. Note that this affects only <em>git diff</em> Porcelain like
*git-diff*(1) and *git-log*(1), and not lower level commands such as
*git-diff-files*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.suppressBlankEmpty</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean to inhibit the standard behavior of printing a space before
each empty output line. Defaults to false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.submodule</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the format in which differences in submodules are shown. The
&#34;short&#34; format just shows the names of the commits at the beginning and
end of the range. The &#34;log&#34; format lists the commits in the range like
<strong>git-submodule*(1) *summary</strong> does. The &#34;diff&#34; format shows an inline
diff of the changed contents of the submodule. Defaults to &#34;short&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.wordRegex</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A POSIX Extended Regular Expression used to determine what is a &#34;word&#34;
when performing word-by-word difference calculations. Character
sequences that match the regular expression are &#34;words&#34;, all other
characters are <strong>ignorable</strong> whitespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.&lt;driver&gt;.command</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The custom diff driver command. See *gitattributes*(5) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.&lt;driver&gt;.trustExitCode</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this boolean value is set to true then the <strong>diff.&lt;driver&gt;.command</strong>
command is expected to return exit code 0 if it considers the input
files to be equal or 1 if it considers them to be different, like
<strong>diff(1)</strong>. If it is set to false, which is the default, then the command
is expected to return exit code 0 regardless of equality. Any other exit
code causes Git to report a fatal error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.&lt;driver&gt;.xfuncname</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The regular expression that the diff driver should use to recognize the
hunk header. A built-in pattern may also be used. See *gitattributes*(5)
for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.&lt;driver&gt;.binary</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set this option to true to make the diff driver treat files as binary.
See *gitattributes*(5) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.&lt;driver&gt;.textconv</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The command that the diff driver should call to generate the
text-converted version of a file. The result of the conversion is used
to generate a human-readable diff. See *gitattributes*(5) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.&lt;driver&gt;.wordRegex</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The regular expression that the diff driver should use to split words in
a line. See *gitattributes*(5) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.&lt;driver&gt;.cachetextconv</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set this option to true to make the diff driver cache the text
conversion outputs. See *gitattributes*(5) for details.</p>

values, <strong>default</strong> reset the list to <strong>new</strong> and <strong>all</strong> is a shorthand for
<strong>old,new,context</strong>. The whitespace errors are colored with
<strong>color.diff.whitespace</strong>. The command line option
<strong>–ws-error-highlight=&lt;kind&gt;</strong> overrides this setting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.colorMoved</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to either a valid <strong>&lt;mode&gt;</strong> or a true value, moved lines in a diff
are colored differently, for details of valid modes see <em>–color-moved</em>
in *git-diff*(1). If simply set to true the default color mode will be
used. When set to false, moved lines are not colored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.colorMovedWS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When moved lines are colored using e.g. the <strong>diff.colorMoved</strong> setting,
this option controls the <strong>&lt;mode&gt;</strong> how spaces are treated. For details of
valid modes see <em>–color-moved-ws</em> in *git-diff*(1).</p>
