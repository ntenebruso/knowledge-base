DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>This command is used to create sparse checkouts, which change the
working tree from having all tracked files present to only having a
subset of those files. It can also switch which subset of files are
present, or undo and go back to having all tracked files present in the
working copy.</p>
<p>
The subset of files is chosen by providing a list of directories in cone
mode (the default), or by providing a list of patterns in non-cone mode.</p>
<p>
When in a sparse-checkout, other Git commands behave a bit differently.
For example, switching branches will not update paths outside the
sparse-checkout directories/patterns, and <strong>git commit -a</strong> will not
record paths outside the sparse-checkout directories/patterns as
deleted.</p>
<p>
THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. ITS BEHAVIOR, AND THE BEHAVIOR OF OTHER
COMMANDS IN THE PRESENCE OF SPARSE-CHECKOUTS, WILL LIKELY CHANGE IN THE
FUTURE.</p>

COMMANDS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p><em>list</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Describe the directories or patterns in the sparse-checkout file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>set</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable the necessary sparse-checkout config settings
(<strong>core.sparseCheckout</strong>, <strong>core.sparseCheckoutCone</strong>, and <strong>index.sparse</strong>)
if they are not already set to the desired values, populate the
sparse-checkout file from the list of arguments following the <em>set</em>
subcommand, and update the working directory to match.</p>
<p>
To ensure that adjusting the sparse-checkout settings within a worktree
does not alter the sparse-checkout settings in other worktrees, the
<em>set</em> subcommand will upgrade your repository config to use
worktree-specific config if not already present. The sparsity defined by
the arguments to the <em>set</em> subcommand are stored in the
worktree-specific sparse-checkout file. See <strong>git-worktree*(1) and the
documentation of *extensions.worktreeConfig</strong> in *git-config*(1) for more
details.</p>
<p>
When the <strong>–stdin</strong> option is provided, the directories or patterns are
read from standard in as a newline-delimited list instead of from the
arguments.</p>
<p>
By default, the input list is considered a list of directories, matching
the output of <strong>git ls-tree -d –name-only</strong>. This includes interpreting
pathnames that begin with a double quote (&#34;) as C-style quoted strings.
Note that all files under the specified directories (at any depth) will
be included in the sparse checkout, as well as files that are siblings
of either the given directory or any of its ancestors (see <em>CONE PATTERN
SET</em> below for more details). In the past, this was not the default, and
<strong>–cone</strong> needed to be specified or <strong>core.sparseCheckoutCone</strong> needed to
be enabled.</p>
<p>
When <strong>–no-cone</strong> is passed, the input list is considered a list of
patterns. This mode has a number of drawbacks, including not working
with some options like <strong>–sparse-index</strong>. As explained in the &#34;Non-cone
Problems&#34; section below, we do not recommend using it.</p>
<p>
Use the <strong>–[no-]sparse-index</strong> option to use a sparse index (the default
is to not use it). A sparse index reduces the size of the index to be
more closely aligned with your sparse-checkout definition. This can have
significant performance advantages for commands such as <strong>git status</strong> or
<strong>git add</strong>. This feature is still experimental. Some commands might be
slower with a sparse index until they are properly integrated with the
feature.</p>
<p>
<strong>WARNING:</strong> Using a sparse index requires modifying the index in a way
that is not completely understood by external tools. If you have trouble
with this compatibility, then run <strong>git sparse-checkout init
–no-sparse-index</strong> to rewrite your index to not be sparse. Older
versions of Git will not understand the sparse directory entries index
extension and may fail to interact with your repository until it is
disabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>add</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update the sparse-checkout file to include additional directories (in
cone mode) or patterns (in non-cone mode). By default, these directories
or patterns are read from the command-line arguments, but they can be
read from stdin using the <strong>–stdin</strong> option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>reapply</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reapply the sparsity pattern rules to paths in the working tree.
Commands like merge or rebase can materialize paths to do their work
(e.g. in order to show you a conflict), and other sparse-checkout
commands might fail to sparsify an individual file (e.g. because it has
unstaged changes or conflicts). In such cases, it can make sense to run
<strong>git sparse-checkout reapply</strong> later after cleaning up affected paths
(e.g. resolving conflicts, undoing or committing changes, etc.).</p>
<p>
The <strong>reapply</strong> command can also take <strong>–[no-]cone</strong> and
<strong>–[no-]sparse-index</strong> flags, with the same meaning as the flags from the
<strong>set</strong> command, in order to change which sparsity mode you are using
without needing to also respecify all sparsity paths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>disable</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disable the <strong>core.sparseCheckout</strong> config setting, and restore the
working directory to include all files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>init</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deprecated command that behaves like <strong>set</strong> with no specified paths. May
be removed in the future.</p>
<p>
Historically, <strong>set</strong> did not handle all the necessary config settings,
which meant that both <strong>init</strong> and <strong>set</strong> had to be called. Invoking both
meant the <strong>init</strong> step would first remove nearly all tracked files (and
in cone mode, ignored files too), then the <strong>set</strong> step would add many of
the tracked files (but not ignored files) back. In addition to the lost
files, the performance and UI of this combination was poor.</p>
<p>
Also, historically, <strong>init</strong> would not actually initialize the
sparse-checkout file if it already existed. This meant it was possible
to return to a sparse-checkout without remembering which paths to pass
to a subsequent <em>set</em> or <em>add</em> command. However, <strong>–cone</strong> and
<strong>–sparse-index</strong> options would not be remembered across the disable
command, so the easy restore of calling a plain <strong>init</strong> decreased in
utility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>check-rules</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Check whether sparsity rules match one or more paths.</p>
<p>
By default <strong>check-rules</strong> reads a list of paths from stdin and outputs
only the ones that match the current sparsity rules. The input is
expected to consist of one path per line, matching the output of <strong>git
ls-tree –name-only</strong> including that pathnames that begin with a double
quote (&#34;) are interpreted as C-style quoted strings.</p>
<p>
When called with the <strong>–rules-file &lt;file&gt;</strong> flag the input files are
matched against the sparse checkout rules found in <strong>&lt;file&gt;</strong> instead of
the current ones. The rules in the files are expected to be in the same
form as accepted by <strong>git sparse-checkout set –stdin</strong> (in particular,
they must be newline-delimited).</p>
<p>
By default, the rules passed to the <strong>–rules-file</strong> option are
interpreted as cone mode directories. To pass non-cone mode patterns
with <strong>–rules-file</strong>, combine the option with the <strong>–no-cone</strong> option.</p>
<p>
When called with the <strong>-z</strong> flag, the format of the paths input on stdin
as well as the output paths are \0 terminated and not quoted. Note that
this does not apply to the format of the rules passed with the
<strong>–rules-file</strong> option.</p>

EXAMPLES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>git sparse-checkout set MY/DIR1 SUB/DIR2</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Change to a sparse checkout with all files (at any depth) under MY/DIR1/
and SUB/DIR2/ present in the working copy (plus all files immediately
under MY/ and SUB/ and the toplevel directory). If already in a sparse
checkout, change which files are present in the working copy to this new
selection. Note that this command will also delete all ignored files in
any directory that no longer has either tracked or non-ignored-untracked
files present.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>git sparse-checkout disable</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Repopulate the working directory with all files, disabling sparse
checkouts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>git sparse-checkout add SOME/DIR/ECTORY</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add all files under SOME/DIR/ECTORY/ (at any depth) to the sparse
checkout, as well as all files immediately under SOME/DIR/ and
immediately under SOME/. Must already be in a sparse checkout before
using this command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>git sparse-checkout reapply</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is possible for commands to update the working tree in a way that
does not respect the selected sparsity directories. This can come from
tools external to Git writing files, or even affect Git commands because
of either special cases (such as hitting conflicts when
merging/rebasing), or because some commands didn&#39;t fully support sparse
checkouts (e.g. the old <strong>recursive</strong> merge backend had only limited
support). This command reapplies the existing sparse directory
specifications to make the working directory match.</p>

INTERNALS — SPARSE CHECKOUT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>&#34;Sparse checkout&#34; allows populating the working directory sparsely. It
uses the skip-worktree bit (see *git-update-index*(1)) to tell Git
whether a file in the working directory is worth looking at. If the
skip-worktree bit is set, and the file is not present in the working
tree, then its absence is ignored. Git will avoid populating the
contents of those files, which makes a sparse checkout helpful when
working in a repository with many files, but only a few are important to
the current user.</p>
<p>
The <strong>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</strong> file is used to define the
skip-worktree reference bitmap. When Git updates the working directory,
it updates the skip-worktree bits in the index based on this file. The
files matching the patterns in the file will appear in the working
directory, and the rest will not.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-7">
INTERNALS — NON-CONE PROBLEMS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The <strong>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</strong> file populated by the <strong>set</strong> and
<strong>add</strong> subcommands is defined to be a bunch of patterns (one per line)
using the same syntax as <strong>.gitignore</strong> files. In cone mode, these
patterns are restricted to matching directories (and users only ever
need supply or see directory names), while in non-cone mode any
gitignore-style pattern is permitted. Using the full gitignore-style
patterns in non-cone mode has a number of shortcomings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Fundamentally, it makes various worktree-updating processes (pull,
merge, rebase, switch, reset, checkout, etc.) require O(N*M) pattern
matches, where N is the number of patterns and M is the number of paths
in the index. This scales poorly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Avoiding the scaling issue has to be done via limiting the number of
patterns via specifying leading directory name or glob.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Passing globs on the command line is error-prone as users may forget to
quote the glob, causing the shell to expand it into all matching files
and pass them all individually along to sparse-checkout set/add. While
this could also be a problem with e.g. &#34;git grep — *.c&#34;, mistakes with
grep/log/status appear in the immediate output. With sparse-checkout,
the mistake gets recorded at the time the sparse-checkout command is run
and might not be problematic until the user later switches branches or
rebases or merges, thus putting a delay between the user&#39;s error and
when they have a chance to catch/notice it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Related to the previous item, sparse-checkout has an <em>add</em> subcommand
but no <em>remove</em> subcommand. Even if a <em>remove</em> subcommand were added,
undoing an accidental unquoted glob runs the risk of &#34;removing too
much&#34;, as it may remove entries that had been included before the
accidental add.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Non-cone mode uses gitignore-style patterns to select what to <strong>include</strong>
(with the exception of negated patterns), while .gitignore files use
gitignore-style patterns to select what to <strong>exclude</strong> (with the exception
of negated patterns). The documentation on gitignore-style patterns
usually does not talk in terms of matching or non-matching, but on what
the user wants to &#34;exclude&#34;. This can cause confusion for users trying
to learn how to specify sparse-checkout patterns to get their desired
behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Every other git subcommand that wants to provide &#34;special path pattern
matching&#34; of some sort uses pathspecs, but non-cone mode for
sparse-checkout uses gitignore patterns, which feels inconsistent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
It has edge cases where the &#34;right&#34; behavior is unclear. Two examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
First, two users are in a subdirectory, and the first runs
   git sparse-checkout set /toplevel-dir/*.c
while the second runs
   git sparse-checkout set relative-dir
Should those arguments be transliterated into
   current/subdirectory/toplevel-dir/*.c
and
   current/subdirectory/relative-dir
before inserting into the sparse-checkout file?  The user who typed
the first command is probably aware that arguments to set/add are
supposed to be patterns in non-cone mode, and probably would not be
happy with such a transliteration.  However, many gitignore-style
patterns are just paths, which might be what the user who typed the
second command was thinking, and theyd be upset if their argument
wasnt transliterated.
</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
Second, what should bash-completion complete on for set/add commands
for non-cone users?  If it suggests paths, is it exacerbating the
problem above?  Also, if it suggests paths, what if the user has a
file or directory that begins with either a ! or # or has a *,
\, ?, [, or ] in its name?  And if it suggests paths, will
it complete &#34;/pro&#34; to &#34;/proc&#34; (in the root filesystem) rather than to
&#34;/progress.txt&#34; in the current directory?  (Note that users are
likely to want to start paths with a leading / in non-cone mode,
for the same reason that .gitignore files often have one.)
Completing on files or directories might give nasty surprises in
all these cases.
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
The excessive flexibility made other extensions essentially impractical.
<strong>–sparse-index</strong> is likely impossible in non-cone mode; even if it is
somehow feasible, it would have been far more work to implement and may
have been too slow in practice. Some ideas for adding coupling between
partial clones and sparse checkouts are only practical with a more
restricted set of paths as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For all these reasons, non-cone mode is deprecated. Please switch to
using cone mode.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-8">
INTERNALS — CONE MODE HANDLING
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The &#34;cone mode&#34;, which is the default, lets you specify only what
directories to include. For any directory specified, all paths below
that directory will be included, and any paths immediately under leading
directories (including the toplevel directory) will also be included.
Thus, if you specified the directory Documentation/technical/ then your
sparse checkout would contain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
all files in the toplevel-directory</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
all files immediately under Documentation/</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
all files at any depth under Documentation/technical/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Also, in cone mode, even if no directories are specified, then the files
in the toplevel directory will be included.</p>
<p>
When changing the sparse-checkout patterns in cone mode, Git will
inspect each tracked directory that is not within the sparse-checkout
cone to see if it contains any untracked files. If all of those files
are ignored due to the <strong>.gitignore</strong> patterns, then the directory will be
deleted. If any of the untracked files within that directory is not
ignored, then no deletions will occur within that directory and a
warning message will appear. If these files are important, then reset
your sparse-checkout definition so they are included, use <strong>git add</strong> and
<strong>git commit</strong> to store them, then remove any remaining files manually to
ensure Git can behave optimally.</p>
<p>
See also the &#34;Internals — Cone Pattern Set&#34; section to learn how the
directories are transformed under the hood into a subset of the Full
Pattern Set of sparse-checkout.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-9">
INTERNALS — FULL PATTERN SET
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The full pattern set allows for arbitrary pattern matches and
complicated inclusion/exclusion rules. These can result in O(N*M)
pattern matches when updating the index, where N is the number of
patterns and M is the number of paths in the index. To combat this
performance issue, a more restricted pattern set is allowed when
<strong>core.sparseCheckoutCone</strong> is enabled.</p>
<p>
The sparse-checkout file uses the same syntax as <strong>.gitignore</strong> files; see
*gitignore*(5) for details. Here, though, the patterns are usually being
used to select which files to include rather than which files to
exclude. (However, it can get a bit confusing since gitignore-style
patterns have negations defined by patterns which begin with a <em>!</em>, so
you can also select files to <em>not</em> include.)</p>
<p>
For example, to select everything, and then to remove the file
<strong>unwanted</strong> (so that every file will appear in your working tree except
the file named <strong>unwanted</strong>):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git sparse-checkout set --no-cone /* !unwanted
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
These patterns are just placed into the <strong>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</strong>
as-is, so the contents of that file at this point would be</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
/*
!unwanted
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
See also the &#34;Sparse Checkout&#34; section of *git-read-tree*(1) to learn
more about the gitignore-style patterns used in sparse checkouts.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-10" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-10">
INTERNALS — CONE PATTERN SET
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-2">
<p>In cone mode, only directories are accepted, but they are translated
into the same gitignore-style patterns used in the full pattern set. We
refer to the particular patterns used in those mode as being of one of
two types:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Recursive:</strong> All paths inside a directory are included.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Parent:</strong> All files immediately inside a directory are included.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Since cone mode always includes files at the toplevel, when running <strong>git
sparse-checkout set</strong> with no directories specified, the toplevel
directory is added as a parent pattern. At this point, the
sparse-checkout file contains the following patterns:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
/*
!/*/
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This says &#34;include everything immediately under the toplevel directory,
but nothing at any level below that.&#34;</p>
<p>
When in cone mode, the <strong>git sparse-checkout set</strong> subcommand takes a list
of directories. The command <strong>git sparse-checkout set A/B/C</strong> sets the
directory <strong>A/B/C</strong> as a recursive pattern, the directories <strong>A</strong> and <strong>A/B</strong>
are added as parent patterns. The resulting sparse-checkout file is now</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
/*
!/*/
/A/
!/A/*/
/A/B/
!/A/B/*/
/A/B/C/
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here, order matters, so the negative patterns are overridden by the
positive patterns that appear lower in the file.</p>
<p>
Unless <strong>core.sparseCheckoutCone</strong> is explicitly set to <strong>false</strong>, Git will
parse the sparse-checkout file expecting patterns of these types. Git
will warn if the patterns do not match. If the patterns do match the
expected format, then Git will use faster hash-based algorithms to
compute inclusion in the sparse-checkout. If they do not match, git will
behave as though <strong>core.sparseCheckoutCone</strong> was false, regardless of its
setting.</p>
<p>
In the cone mode case, despite the fact that full patterns are written
to the $GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout file, the <strong>git sparse-checkout
list</strong> subcommand will list the directories that define the recursive
patterns. For the example sparse-checkout file above, the output is as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git sparse-checkout list
A/B/C
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If <strong>core.ignoreCase=true</strong>, then the pattern-matching algorithm will use
a case-insensitive check. This corrects for case mismatched filenames in
the <em>git sparse-checkout set</em> command to reflect the expected cone in
the working directory.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-11" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-11">
INTERNALS — SUBMODULES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-2">
<p>If your repository contains one or more submodules, then submodules are
populated based on interactions with the <strong>git submodule</strong> command.
Specifically, <strong>git submodule init – &lt;path&gt;</strong> will ensure the submodule
at <strong>&lt;path&gt;</strong> is present, while <strong>git submodule deinit [-f] – &lt;path&gt;</strong> will
remove the files for the submodule at <strong>&lt;path&gt;</strong> (including any untracked
files, uncommitted changes, and unpushed history). Similar to how
sparse-checkout removes files from the working tree but still leaves
entries in the index, deinitialized submodules are removed from the
working directory but still have an entry in the index.</p>
<p>
Since submodules may have unpushed changes or untracked files, removing
them could result in data loss. Thus, changing sparse
inclusion/exclusion rules will not cause an already checked out
submodule to be removed from the working copy. Said another way, just as
<strong>checkout</strong> will not cause submodules to be automatically removed or
initialized even when switching between branches that remove or add
submodules, using <strong>sparse-checkout</strong> to reduce or expand the scope of
&#34;interesting&#34; files will not cause submodules to be automatically
deinitialized or initialized either.</p>
<p>
Further, the above facts mean that there are multiple reasons that
&#34;tracked&#34; files might not be present in the working copy: sparsity
pattern application from sparse-checkout, and submodule initialization
state. Thus, commands like <strong>git grep</strong> that work on tracked files in the
working copy may return results that are limited by either or both of
these restrictions.</p>
