DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the
current HEAD commit, paths that have differences between the working
tree and the index file, and paths in the working tree that are not
tracked by Git (and are not ignored by <strong>gitignore*(5)). The first are
what you <em>would</em> commit by running *git commit</strong>; the second and third
are what you <em>could</em> commit by running <em>git add</em> before running <strong>git
commit</strong>.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>-s, –short</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give the output in the short-format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-b, –branch</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the branch and tracking info even in short-format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–show-stash</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the number of entries currently stashed away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–porcelain[=&lt;version&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give the output in an easy-to-parse format for scripts. This is similar
to the short output, but will remain stable across Git versions and
regardless of user configuration. See below for details.</p>
<p>
The version parameter is used to specify the format version. This is
optional and defaults to the original version <em>v1</em> format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–long</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give the output in the long-format. This is the default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-v, –verbose</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the names of files that have been changed, also show the
textual changes that are staged to be committed (i.e., like the output
of <strong>git diff –cached</strong>). If <strong>-v</strong> is specified twice, then also show the
changes in the working tree that have not yet been staged (i.e., like
the output of <strong>git diff</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-u[&lt;mode&gt;], –untracked-files[=&lt;mode&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show untracked files.</p>
<p>
The mode parameter is used to specify the handling of untracked files.
It is optional: it defaults to <em>all</em>, and if specified, it must be stuck
to the option (e.g. <strong>-uno</strong>, but not <strong>-u no</strong>).</p>
<p>
The possible options are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>no</em> - Show no untracked files.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>normal</em> - Shows untracked files and directories.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>all</em> - Also shows individual files in untracked directories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
When <strong>-u</strong> option is not used, untracked files and directories are shown
(i.e. the same as specifying <strong>normal</strong>), to help you avoid forgetting to
add newly created files. Because it takes extra work to find untracked
files in the filesystem, this mode may take some time in a large working
tree. Consider enabling untracked cache and split index if supported
(see <strong>git update-index –untracked-cache</strong> and <strong>git update-index
–split-index</strong>), Otherwise you can use <strong>no</strong> to have <strong>git status</strong> return
more quickly without showing untracked files. All usual spellings for
Boolean value <strong>true</strong> are taken as <strong>normal</strong> and <strong>false</strong> as <strong>no</strong>.</p>
<p>
The default can be changed using the status.showUntrackedFiles
configuration variable documented in *git-config*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignore-submodules[=&lt;when&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore changes to submodules when looking for changes. &lt;when&gt; can be
either &#34;none&#34;, &#34;untracked&#34;, &#34;dirty&#34; or &#34;all&#34;, which is the default.
Using &#34;none&#34; will consider the submodule modified when it either
contains untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit
recorded in the superproject and can be used to override any settings of
the <em>ignore</em> option in *git-config*(1) or *gitmodules*(5). When
&#34;untracked&#34; is used submodules are not considered dirty when they only
contain untracked content (but they are still scanned for modified
content). Using &#34;dirty&#34; ignores all changes to the work tree of
submodules, only changes to the commits stored in the superproject are
shown (this was the behavior before 1.7.0). Using &#34;all&#34; hides all
changes to submodules (and suppresses the output of submodule summaries
when the config option <strong>status.submoduleSummary</strong> is set).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignored[=&lt;mode&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show ignored files as well.</p>
<p>
The mode parameter is used to specify the handling of ignored files. It
is optional: it defaults to <em>traditional</em>.</p>
<p>
The possible options are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>traditional</em> - Shows ignored files and directories, unless
–untracked-files=all is specified, in which case individual files in
ignored directories are displayed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>no</em> - Show no ignored files.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>matching</em> - Shows ignored files and directories matching an ignore
pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
When <em>matching</em> mode is specified, paths that explicitly match an
ignored pattern are shown. If a directory matches an ignore pattern,
then it is shown, but not paths contained in the ignored directory. If a
directory does not match an ignore pattern, but all contents are
ignored, then the directory is not shown, but all contents are shown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-z</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Terminate entries with NUL, instead of LF. This implies the
<strong>–porcelain=v1</strong> output format if no other format is given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–column[=&lt;options&gt;], –no-column</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Display untracked files in columns. See configuration variable
<strong>column.status</strong> for option syntax. <strong>–column</strong> and <strong>–no-column</strong> without
options are equivalent to <em>always</em> and <em>never</em> respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ahead-behind, –no-ahead-behind</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Display or do not display detailed ahead/behind counts for the branch
relative to its upstream branch. Defaults to true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–renames, –no-renames</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn on/off rename detection regardless of user configuration. See also
<strong>git-diff*(1) *–no-renames</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn on rename detection, optionally setting the similarity threshold.
See also <strong>git-diff*(1) *–find-renames</strong>.</p>

OUTPUT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The output from this command is designed to be used as a commit template
comment. The default, long format, is designed to be human readable,
verbose and descriptive. Its contents and format are subject to change
at any time.</p>
<p>
The paths mentioned in the output, unlike many other Git commands, are
made relative to the current directory if you are working in a
subdirectory (this is on purpose, to help cutting and pasting). See the
status.relativePaths config option below.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-6">
Short Format
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>In the short-format, the status of each path is shown as one of these
forms</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
XY PATH
XY ORIG_PATH -&gt; PATH
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
where <strong>ORIG_PATH</strong> is where the renamed/copied contents came from.
<strong>ORIG_PATH</strong> is only shown when the entry is renamed or copied. The <strong>XY</strong>
is a two-letter status code.</p>
<p>
The fields (including the <strong>-&gt;</strong>) are separated from each other by a
single space. If a filename contains whitespace or other nonprintable
characters, that field will be quoted in the manner of a C string
literal: surrounded by ASCII double quote (34) characters, and with
interior special characters backslash-escaped.</p>
<p>
There are three different types of states that are shown using this
format, and each one uses the <strong>XY</strong> syntax differently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
When a merge is occurring and the merge was successful, or outside of a
merge situation, <strong>X</strong> shows the status of the index and <strong>Y</strong> shows the
status of the working tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
When a merge conflict has occurred and has not yet been resolved, <strong>X</strong>
and <strong>Y</strong> show the state introduced by each head of the merge, relative to
the common ancestor. These paths are said to be <em>unmerged</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
When a path is untracked, <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> are always the same, since they
are unknown to the index. <strong>??</strong> is used for untracked paths. Ignored
files are not listed unless <strong>–ignored</strong> is used; if it is, ignored files
are indicated by <strong>!!</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that the term <em>merge</em> here also includes rebases using the default
<strong>–merge</strong> strategy, cherry-picks, and anything else using the merge
machinery.</p>
<p>
In the following table, these three classes are shown in separate
sections, and these characters are used for <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> fields for the
first two sections that show tracked paths:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
= unmodified</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>M</em> = modified</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>T</em> = file type changed (regular file, symbolic link or submodule)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>A</em> = added</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>D</em> = deleted</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>R</em> = renamed</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>C</em> = copied (if config option status.renames is set to &#34;copies&#34;)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>U</em> = updated but unmerged</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">

<p>
Submodules have more state and instead report</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>M</em> = the submodule has a different HEAD than recorded in the index</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>m</em> = the submodule has modified content</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>?</em> = the submodule has untracked files</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is since modified content or untracked files in a submodule cannot
be added via <strong>git add</strong> in the superproject to prepare a commit.</p>
<p>
<em>m</em> and <em>?</em> are applied recursively. For example if a nested submodule
in a submodule contains an untracked file, this is reported as <em>?</em> as
well.</p>
<p>
If -b is used the short-format status is preceded by a line</p>
<blockquote>

Porcelain Format Version 1
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Version 1 porcelain format is similar to the short format, but is
guaranteed not to change in a backwards-incompatible way between Git
versions or based on user configuration. This makes it ideal for parsing
by scripts. The description of the short format above also describes the
porcelain format, with a few exceptions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The user&#39;s color.status configuration is not respected; color will
always be off.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The user&#39;s status.relativePaths configuration is not respected; paths
shown will always be relative to the repository root.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is also an alternate -z format recommended for machine parsing. In
that format, the status field is the same, but some other things change.
First, the <em>-&gt;</em> is omitted from rename entries and the field order is
reversed (e.g <em>from -&gt; to</em> becomes <em>to from</em>). Second, a NUL (ASCII 0)
follows each filename, replacing space as a field separator and the
terminating newline (but a space still separates the status field from
the first filename). Third, filenames containing special characters are
not specially formatted; no quoting or backslash-escaping is performed.</p>
<p>
Any submodule changes are reported as modified <strong>M</strong> instead of <strong>m</strong> or
single <strong>?</strong>.</p>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-8">
Porcelain Format Version 2
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Version 2 format adds more detailed information about the state of the
worktree and changed items. Version 2 also defines an extensible set of
easy to parse optional headers.</p>
<p>
Header lines start with &#34;#&#34; and are added in response to specific
command line arguments. Parsers should ignore headers they don&#39;t
recognize.</p>
<p>
\\</p>
<p>
<strong>Branch Headers</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <strong>–branch</strong> is given, a series of header lines are printed with
information about the current branch.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
Line                                     Notes
------------------------------------------------------------
# branch.oid &lt;commit&gt; | (initial)        Current commit.
# branch.head &lt;branch&gt; | (detached)      Current branch.
# branch.upstream &lt;upstream-branch&gt;      If upstream is set.
# branch.ab +&lt;ahead&gt; -&lt;behind&gt;           If upstream is set and

<strong>Stash Information</strong></p>

<p>If <strong>–show-stash</strong> is given, one line is printed showing the number of
stash entries if non-zero:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# stash &lt;N&gt;

</blockquote>
<p>
\\</p>
<p>
<strong>Changed Tracked Entries</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following the headers, a series of lines are printed for tracked
entries. One of three different line formats may be used to describe an
entry depending on the type of change. Tracked entries are printed in an
undefined order; parsers should allow for a mixture of the 3 line types
in any order.</p>
<p>
Ordinary changed entries have the following format:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
1 &lt;XY&gt; &lt;sub&gt; &lt;mH&gt; &lt;mI&gt; &lt;mW&gt; &lt;hH&gt; &lt;hI&gt; &lt;path&gt;

&lt;hI&gt;        The object name in the index.
&lt;X&gt;&lt;score&gt;  The rename or copy score (denoting the percentage

&lt;path&gt;      The pathname.  In a renamed/copied entry, this
            is the target path.
&lt;sep&gt;       When the `-z` option is used, the 2 pathnames are separated
            with a NUL (ASCII 0x00) byte; otherwise, a tab (ASCII 0x09)
            byte separates them.
&lt;origPath&gt;  The pathname in the commit at HEAD or in the index.
            This is only present in a renamed/copied entry, and
            tells where the renamed/copied contents came from.

<p>By default, <strong>git status</strong> will automatically refresh the index, updating
the cached stat information from the working tree and writing out the
result. Writing out the updated index is an optimization that isn&#39;t
strictly necessary (<strong>status</strong> computes the values for itself, but writing
them out is just to save subsequent programs from repeating our
computation). When <strong>status</strong> is run in the background, the lock held
during the write may conflict with other simultaneous processes, causing
them to fail. Scripts running <strong>status</strong> in the background should consider
using <strong>git –no-optional-locks status</strong> (see *git*(1) for details).</p>

UNTRACKED FILES AND PERFORMANCE
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>git status</strong> can be very slow in large worktrees if/when it needs to
search for untracked files and directories. There are many configuration
options available to speed this up by either avoiding the work or making
use of cached results from previous Git commands. There is no single
optimum set of settings right for everyone. We&#39;ll list a summary of the
relevant options to help you, but before going into the list, you may
want to run <strong>git status</strong> again, because your configuration may already
be caching <strong>git status</strong> results, so it could be faster on subsequent
runs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
The <strong>–untracked-files=no</strong> flag or the <strong>status.showUntrackedFiles=no</strong>
config (see above for both): indicate that <strong>git status</strong> should not
report untracked files. This is the fastest option. <strong>git status</strong> will
not list the untracked files, so you need to be careful to remember if
you create any new files and manually <strong>git add</strong> them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>advice.statusUoption=false</strong> (see <strong>git-config*(1)): setting this
variable to *false</strong> disables the warning message given when enumerating
untracked files takes more than 2 seconds. In a large project, it may
take longer and the user may have already accepted the trade off (e.g.
using &#34;-uno&#34; may not be an acceptable option for the user), in which
case, there is no point issuing the warning message, and in such a case,
disabling the warning may be the best.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>core.untrackedCache=true</strong> (see *git-update-index*(1)): enable the
untracked cache feature and only search directories that have been
modified since the previous <strong>git status</strong> command. Git remembers the set
of untracked files within each directory and assumes that if a directory
has not been modified, then the set of untracked files within has not
changed. This is much faster than enumerating the contents of every
directory, but still not without cost, because Git still has to search
for the set of modified directories. The untracked cache is stored in
the <strong>.git/index</strong> file. The reduced cost of searching for untracked files
is offset slightly by the increased size of the index and the cost of
keeping it up-to-date. That reduced search time is usually worth the
additional size.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>core.untrackedCache=true</strong> and <strong>core.fsmonitor=true</strong> or
<strong>core.fsmonitor=&lt;hook-command-pathname&gt;</strong> (see *git-update-index*(1)):
enable both the untracked cache and FSMonitor features and only search
directories that have been modified since the previous <strong>git status</strong>
command. This is faster than using just the untracked cache alone
because Git can also avoid searching for modified directories. Git only
has to enumerate the exact set of directories that have changed
recently. While the FSMonitor feature can be enabled without the
untracked cache, the benefits are greatly reduced in that case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that after you turn on the untracked cache and/or FSMonitor
features it may take a few <strong>git status</strong> commands for the various caches
to warm up before you see improved command times. This is normal.</p>
