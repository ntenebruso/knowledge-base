<h3 id="headline-4">
tset - initialization
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p>This program initializes terminals.</p>
<p>
First, <strong>tset</strong> retrieves the current terminal mode settings for your
terminal. It does this by successively testing</p>
<ul>
<li>the standard error,</li>
<li>standard output,</li>
<li>standard input and</li>
<li>ultimately /dev/tty</li>
</ul>
<p>to obtain terminal settings. Having retrieved these settings, <strong>tset</strong>
remembers which file descriptor to use when updating settings.</p>
<p>
Next, <strong>tset</strong> determines the type of terminal that you are using. This
determination is done as follows, using the first terminal type found.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>terminal</strong> argument specified on the command line.</li>
<li>The value of the <strong>TERM</strong> environmental variable.</li>
<li>(BSD systems only.) The terminal type associated with the standard</li>
</ol>
<p>error output device in the <em>/etc/ttys</em> file. (On System-V-like UNIXes
and systems using that convention, <strong>getty*(1) does this job by setting
*TERM</strong> according to the type passed to it by <em>/etc/inittab</em>.)</p>
<ol>
<li>The default terminal type, unknown.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the terminal type was not specified on the command-line, the <strong>-m</strong>
option mappings are then applied (see the section <strong>TERMINAL TYPE
MAPPING</strong> for more information). Then, if the terminal type begins with a
question mark (?), the user is prompted for confirmation of the terminal
type. An empty response confirms the type, or, another type can be
entered to specify a new type. Once the terminal type has been
determined, the terminal description for the terminal is retrieved. If
no terminal description is found for the type, the user is prompted for
another terminal type.</p>
<p>
Once the terminal description is retrieved,</p>
<ul>
<li>if the <strong>-w</strong> option is enabled, <strong>tset</strong> may update the terminal&#39;s window
size.

If the window size cannot be obtained from the operating system, but
the terminal description (or environment, e.g., <strong>LINES</strong> and <strong>COLUMNS</strong>
variables specify this), use this to set the operating system&#39;s notion
of the window size.</li>
<li>if the <strong>-c</strong> option is enabled, the backspace, interrupt and line kill
characters (among many other things) are set</li>
<li>unless the <strong>-I</strong> option is enabled, the terminal and tab
<em>initialization</em> strings are sent to the standard error output, and
<strong>tset</strong> waits one second (in case a hardware reset was issued).</li>
<li>Finally, if the erase, interrupt and line kill characters have
changed, or are not set to their default values, their values are
displayed to the standard error output.</li>
</ul>

reset - reinitialization
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>When invoked as <strong>reset</strong>, <strong>tset</strong> sets the terminal modes to sane values:</p>
<ul>
<li>sets cooked and echo modes,</li>
<li>turns off cbreak and raw modes,</li>
<li>turns on newline translation and</li>
<li>resets any unset special characters to their default values</li>
</ul>
<p>before doing the terminal initialization described above. Also, rather
than using the terminal <em>initialization</em> strings, it uses the terminal
<em>reset</em> strings.</p>
<p>
The <strong>reset</strong> command is useful after a program dies leaving a terminal in
an abnormal state:</p>
<ul>
<li>you may have to type</li>
</ul>
<p><em>&lt;LF&gt;/*reset*/&lt;LF&gt;</em></p>
<p>
(the line-feed character is normally control-J) to get the terminal to
work, as carriage-return may no longer work in the abnormal state.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, the terminal will often not echo the command.</li>
</ul>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The options are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-c</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set control characters and modes.</dd>
<dt>
*-e */ch/
</dt>
<dd>Set the erase character to <em>ch</em>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-I</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Do not send the terminal or tab initialization strings to the
terminal.</dd>
<dt>
*-i */ch/
</dt>
<dd>Set the interrupt character to <em>ch</em>.</dd>
<dt>
*-k */ch/
</dt>
<dd>Set the line kill character to <em>ch</em>.</dd>
<dt>
*-m */mapping/
</dt>
<dd>Specify a mapping from a port type to a terminal.
See the section <strong>TERMINAL TYPE MAPPING</strong> for more information.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-Q</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Do not display any values for the erase, interrupt and line
kill characters. Normally <strong>tset</strong> displays the values for control
characters which differ from the system&#39;s default values.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-q</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The terminal type is displayed to the standard output, and the
terminal is not initialized in any way. The option - by itself is
equivalent but archaic.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-r</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print the terminal type to the standard error output.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-s</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print the sequence of shell commands to initialize the
environment variable <strong>TERM</strong> to the standard output. See the section
<strong>SETTING THE ENVIRONMENT</strong> for details.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-V</strong>
</dt>
<dd>reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program,
and exits.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-w</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Resize the window to match the size deduced via
<strong>setupterm*(3X). Normally this has no effect, unless *setupterm</strong> is
not able to detect the window size.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The arguments for the <strong>-e</strong>, <strong>-i</strong>, and <strong>-k</strong> options may either be entered
as actual characters or by using the hat notation, i.e., control-h may
be specified as ^H or ^h.</p>
<p>
If neither <strong>-c</strong> or <strong>-w</strong> is given, both options are assumed.</p>

SETTING THE ENVIRONMENT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>It is often desirable to enter the terminal type and information about
the terminal&#39;s capabilities into the shell&#39;s environment. This is done
using the <strong>-s</strong> option.</p>
<p>
When the <strong>-s</strong> option is specified, the commands to enter the information
into the shell&#39;s environment are written to the standard output. If the
<strong>SHELL</strong> environmental variable ends in csh, the commands are for <strong>csh</strong>,
otherwise, they are for <strong>sh*(1). Note, the *csh</strong> commands set and unset
the shell variable <strong>noglob</strong>, leaving it unset. The following line in the
<strong>.login</strong> or <strong>.profile</strong> files will initialize the environment correctly:</p>
<p>
eval `tset -s options â€¦ `</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-8">
TERMINAL TYPE MAPPING
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When the terminal is not hardwired into the system (or the current
system information is incorrect) the terminal type derived from the
<em>/etc/ttys</em> file or the <strong>TERM</strong> environmental variable is often something
generic like <strong>network</strong>, <strong>dialup</strong>, or <strong>unknown</strong>. When <strong>tset</strong> is used in a
startup script it is often desirable to provide information about the
type of terminal used on such ports.</p>
<p>
The <strong>-m</strong> options maps from some set of conditions to a terminal type,
that is, to tell <strong>tset</strong> If I&#39;m on this port at a particular speed, guess
that I&#39;m on that kind of terminal.</p>
<p>
The argument to the <strong>-m</strong> option consists of an optional port type, an
optional operator, an optional baud rate specification, an optional
colon (:) character and a terminal type. The port type is a string
(delimited by either the operator or the colon character). The operator
may be any combination of &gt;, &lt;, @, and !; &gt; means greater than, &lt; means
less than, @ means equal to and ! inverts the sense of the test. The
baud rate is specified as a number and is compared with the speed of the
standard error output (which should be the control terminal). The
terminal type is a string.</p>
<p>
If the terminal type is not specified on the command line, the <strong>-m</strong>
mappings are applied to the terminal type. If the port type and baud
rate match the mapping, the terminal type specified in the mapping
replaces the current type. If more than one mapping is specified, the
first applicable mapping is used.</p>
<p>
For example, consider the following mapping: <strong>dialup&gt;9600:vt100</strong>. The
port type is dialup , the operator is &gt;, the baud rate specification is
9600, and the terminal type is vt100. The result of this mapping is to
specify that if the terminal type is <strong>dialup</strong>, and the baud rate is
greater than 9600 baud, a terminal type of <strong>vt100</strong> will be used.</p>
<p>
If no baud rate is specified, the terminal type will match any baud
rate. If no port type is specified, the terminal type will match any
port type. For example, <strong>-m dialup:vt100 -m :?xterm</strong> will cause any
dialup port, regardless of baud rate, to match the terminal type vt100,
and any non-dialup port type to match the terminal type ?xterm. Note,
because of the leading question mark, the user will be queried on a
default port as to whether they are actually using an xterm terminal.</p>
<p>
No whitespace characters are permitted in the <strong>-m</strong> option argument.
Also, to avoid problems with meta-characters, it is suggested that the
entire <strong>-m</strong> option argument be placed within single quote characters,
and that <strong>csh</strong> users insert a backslash character (\) before any
exclamation marks (!).</p>

HISTORY
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p>A <strong>reset</strong> command appeared in 1BSD (March 1978), written by Kurt Shoens.
This program set the <em>erase</em> and <em>kill</em> characters to <strong>^H</strong> (backspace)
and <strong>@</strong> respectively. Mark Horton improved that in 3BSD (October 1979),
adding <em>intr</em>, <em>quit</em>, <em>start///stop</em> and <em>eof</em> characters as well as
changing the program to avoid modifying any user settings. That version
of <strong>reset</strong> did not use the termcap database.</p>
<p>
A separate <strong>tset</strong> command was provided in 1BSD by Eric Allman, using the
termcap database. Allman&#39;s comments in the source code indicate that he
began work in October 1977, continuing development over the next few
years.</p>
<p>
According to comments in the source code, the <strong>tset</strong> program was
modified in September 1980, to use logic copied from the 3BSD reset when
it was invoked as <strong>reset</strong>. This version appeared in 4.1cBSD, late
in 1982.</p>
<p>
Other developers (e.g., Keith Bostic and Jim Bloom) continued to modify
<strong>tset</strong> until 4.4BSD was released in 1993.</p>
<p>
The <strong>ncurses</strong> implementation was lightly adapted from the 4.4BSD sources
for a terminfo environment by Eric S. Raymond &lt;esr@snark.thyrsus.com&gt;.</p>
</div>

COMPATIBILITY
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Neither IEEE Std 1003.1/The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7
(POSIX.1-2008) nor X/Open Curses Issue 7 documents <strong>tset</strong> or <strong>reset</strong>.</p>
<p>
The AT&amp;T <strong>tput</strong> utility (AIX, HPUX, Solaris) incorporated the
terminal-mode manipulation as well as termcap-based features such as
resetting tabstops from <strong>tset</strong> in BSD (4.1c), presumably with the
intention of making <strong>tset</strong> obsolete. However, each of those systems
still provides <strong>tset</strong>. In fact, the commonly-used <strong>reset</strong> utility is
always an alias for <strong>tset</strong>.</p>
<p>
The <strong>tset</strong> utility provides for backward-compatibility with BSD
environments (under most modern UNIXes, <strong>/etc/inittab</strong> and <strong>getty*(1)
can set *TERM</strong> appropriately for each dial-up line; this obviates what
was <strong>tset</strong>&#39;s most important use). This implementation behaves like
4.4BSD <strong>tset</strong>, with a few exceptions specified here.</p>
<p>
A few options are different because the <strong>TERMCAP</strong> variable is no longer
supported under terminfo-based <strong>ncurses</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>-S</strong> option of BSD <strong>tset</strong> no longer works; it prints an error
message to the standard error and dies.</li>
<li>The <strong>-s</strong> option only sets <strong>TERM</strong>, not <strong>TERMCAP</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was an undocumented 4.4BSD feature that invoking <strong>tset</strong> via a link
named TSET (or via any other name beginning with an upper-case letter)
set the terminal to use upper-case only. This feature has been omitted.</p>
<p>
The <strong>-A</strong>, <strong>-E</strong>, <strong>-h</strong>, <strong>-u</strong> and <strong>-v</strong> options were deleted from the <strong>tset</strong>
utility in 4.4BSD. None of them were documented in 4.3BSD and all are of
limited utility at best. The <strong>-a</strong>, <strong>-d</strong>, and <strong>-p</strong> options are similarly
not documented or useful, but were retained as they appear to be in
widespread use. It is strongly recommended that any usage of these three
options be changed to use the <strong>-m</strong> option instead. The <strong>-a</strong>, <strong>-d</strong>, and
<strong>-p</strong> options are therefore omitted from the usage summary above.</p>
<p>
Very old systems, e.g., 3BSD, used a different terminal driver which was
replaced in 4BSD in the early 1980s. To accommodate these older systems,
the 4BSD <strong>tset</strong> provided a <strong>-n</strong> option to specify that the new terminal
driver should be used. This implementation does not provide that choice.</p>
<p>
It is still permissible to specify the <strong>-e</strong>, <strong>-i</strong>, and <strong>-k</strong> options
without arguments, although it is strongly recommended that such usage
be fixed to explicitly specify the character.</p>
<p>
As of 4.4BSD, executing <strong>tset</strong> as <strong>reset</strong> no longer implies the <strong>-Q</strong>
option. Also, the interaction between the - option and the <em>terminal</em>
argument in some historic implementations of <strong>tset</strong> has been removed.</p>
<p>
The <strong>-c</strong> and <strong>-w</strong> options are not found in earlier implementations.
However, a different window size-change feature was provided in 4.4BSD.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 4.4BSD, <strong>tset</strong> uses the window size from the termcap description to
set the window size if <strong>tset</strong> is not able to obtain the window size
from the operating system.</li>
<li>In ncurses, <strong>tset</strong> obtains the window size using <strong>setupterm</strong>, which
may be from the operating system, the <strong>LINES</strong> and <strong>COLUMNS</strong>
environment variables or the terminal description.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obtaining the window size from the terminal description is common to
both implementations, but considered obsolescent. Its only practical use
is for hardware terminals. Generally speaking, a window size would be
unset only if there were some problem obtaining the value from the
operating system (and <strong>setupterm</strong> would still fail). For that reason,
the <strong>LINES</strong> and <strong>COLUMNS</strong> environment variables may be useful for
working around window-size problems. Those have the drawback that if the
window is resized, those variables must be recomputed and reassigned. To
do this more easily, use the *resize*(1) program.</p>
