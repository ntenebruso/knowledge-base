DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>dnssec-keygen</strong> generates keys for DNSSEC (Secure DNS), as defined in
<em>RFC 2535</em> and <em>RFC 4034</em>.</p>
<p>
The <strong>name</strong> of the key is specified on the command line. For DNSSEC keys,
this must match the name of the zone for which the key is being
generated.</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-4">
OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-3</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option uses an NSEC3-capable algorithm to generate a
DNSSEC key. If this option is used with an algorithm that has both
NSEC and NSEC3 versions, then the NSEC3 version is selected; for
example, <strong>dnssec-keygen -3 -a RSASHA1</strong> specifies the NSEC3RSASHA1
algorithm.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-a algorithm</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option selects the cryptographic algorithm. For
DNSSEC keys, the value of <strong>algorithm</strong> must be one of RSASHA1,
NSEC3RSASHA1, RSASHA256, RSASHA512, ECDSAP256SHA256, ECDSAP384SHA384,
ED25519, or ED448. For TKEY, the value must be DH (Diffie-Hellman);
specifying this value automatically sets the <em>-T KEY</em> option as well.

These values are case-insensitive. In some cases, abbreviations are
supported, such as ECDSA256 for ECDSAP256SHA256 and ECDSA384 for
ECDSAP384SHA384. If RSASHA1 is specified along with the <em>-3</em> option,
NSEC3RSASHA1 is used instead.

This parameter <em>must</em> be specified except when using the <em>-S</em> option,
which copies the algorithm from the predecessor key.

In prior releases, HMAC algorithms could be generated for use as TSIG
keys, but that feature was removed in BIND 9.13.0. Use <em>tsig-keygen</em>
to generate TSIG keys.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-b keysize</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option specifies the number of bits in the key.
The choice of key size depends on the algorithm used: RSA keys must be
between 1024 and 4096 bits; Diffie-Hellman keys must be between 128
and 4096 bits. Elliptic curve algorithms do not need this parameter.

If the key size is not specified, some algorithms have pre-defined
defaults. For example, RSA keys for use as DNSSEC zone-signing keys
have a default size of 1024 bits; RSA keys for use as key-signing keys
(KSKs, generated with <em>-f KSK</em>) default to 2048 bits.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-C</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option enables compatibility mode, which generates an
old-style key, without any timing metadata. By default,
<strong>dnssec-keygen</strong> includes the key&#39;s creation date in the metadata
stored with the private key; other dates may be set there as well,
including publication date, activation date, etc. Keys that include
this data may be incompatible with older versions of BIND; the <em>-C</em>
option suppresses them.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-c class</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option indicates that the DNS record containing the
key should have the specified class. If not specified, class IN is
used.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-d bits</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option specifies the key size in bits. For the
algorithms RSASHA1, NSEC3RSASA1, RSASHA256, and RSASHA512 the key size
must be between 1024 and 4096 bits; DH size is between 128 and 4096
bits. This option is ignored for algorithms ECDSAP256SHA256,
ECDSAP384SHA384, ED25519, and ED448.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-E engine</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option specifies the cryptographic hardware to
use, when applicable.

When BIND 9 is built with OpenSSL, this needs to be set to the OpenSSL
engine identifier that drives the cryptographic accelerator or
hardware service module (usually <strong>pkcs11</strong>).</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-f flag</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the specified flag in the flag field of
the KEY/DNSKEY record. The only recognized flags are KSK (Key-Signing
Key) and REVOKE.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-G</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option generates a key, but does not publish it or sign
with it. This option is incompatible with <em>-P</em> and <em>-A</em>.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-g generator</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option indicates the generator to use if
generating a Diffie-Hellman key. Allowed values are 2 and 5. If no
generator is specified, a known prime from <em>RFC 2539</em> is used if
possible; otherwise the default is 2.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-h</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option prints a short summary of the options and
arguments to <strong>dnssec-keygen</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-K directory</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the directory in which the key
files are to be written.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-k policy</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option creates keys for a specific
<strong>dnssec-policy</strong>. If a policy uses multiple keys, <strong>dnssec-keygen</strong>
generates multiple keys. This also creates a &#34;.state&#34; file to keep
track of the key state.

This option creates keys according to the <strong>dnssec-policy</strong>
configuration, hence it cannot be used at the same time as many of the
other options that <strong>dnssec-keygen</strong> provides.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-L ttl</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the default TTL to use for this key when
it is converted into a DNSKEY RR. This is the TTL used when the key is
imported into a zone, unless there was already a DNSKEY RRset in
place, in which case the existing TTL takes precedence. If this value
is not set and there is no existing DNSKEY RRset, the TTL defaults to
the SOA TTL. Setting the default TTL to <strong>0</strong> or <strong>none</strong> is the same as
leaving it unset.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-l file</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option provides a configuration file that contains a
<strong>dnssec-policy</strong> statement (matching the policy set with <em>-k</em>).</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-n nametype</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option specifies the owner type of the key. The
value of <strong>nametype</strong> must either be ZONE (for a DNSSEC zone key
(KEY/DNSKEY)), HOST or ENTITY (for a key associated with a host
(KEY)), USER (for a key associated with a user (KEY)), or OTHER
(DNSKEY). These values are case-insensitive. The default is ZONE for
DNSKEY generation.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-p protocol</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the protocol value for the generated
key, for use with <em>-T KEY</em>. The protocol is a number between 0
and 255. The default is 3 (DNSSEC). Other possible values for this
argument are listed in <em>RFC 2535</em> and its successors.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-q</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets quiet mode, which suppresses unnecessary
output, including progress indication. Without this option, when
<strong>dnssec-keygen</strong> is run interactively to generate an RSA or DSA key
pair, it prints a string of symbols to <strong>stderr</strong> indicating the
progress of the key generation. A <strong>.</strong> indicates that a random number
has been found which passed an initial sieve test; <strong>+</strong> means a number
has passed a single round of the Miller-Rabin primality test; and a
space ( ) means that the number has passed all the tests and is a
satisfactory key.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-S key</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option creates a new key which is an explicit
successor to an existing key. The name, algorithm, size, and type of
the key are set to match the existing key. The activation date of the
new key is set to the inactivation date of the existing one. The
publication date is set to the activation date minus the
prepublication interval, which defaults to 30 days.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-s strength</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option specifies the strength value of the key.
The strength is a number between 0 and 15, and currently has no
defined purpose in DNSSEC.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-T rrtype</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option specifies the resource record type to use
for the key. <strong>rrtype</strong> must be either DNSKEY or KEY. The default is
DNSKEY when using a DNSSEC algorithm, but it can be overridden to KEY
for use with SIG(0).</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-t type</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option indicates the type of the key for use with
<em>-T KEY</em>. <strong>type</strong> must be one of AUTHCONF, NOAUTHCONF, NOAUTH, or
NOCONF. The default is AUTHCONF. AUTH refers to the ability to
authenticate data, and CONF to the ability to encrypt data.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-V</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option prints version information.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-v level</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the debugging level.</dd>
</dl>

TIMING OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS (which
is the format used inside key files), or &#39;Day Mon DD HH:MM:SS YYYY&#39; (as
printed by <strong>dnssec-settime -p</strong>), or UNIX epoch time (as printed by
<strong>dnssec-settime -up</strong>), or the literal <strong>now</strong>.</p>
<p>
The argument can be followed by <strong>+</strong> or <strong>-</strong> and an offset from the given
time. The literal <strong>now</strong> can be omitted before an offset. The offset can
be followed by one of the suffixes <strong>y</strong>, <strong>mo</strong>, <strong>w</strong>, <strong>d</strong>, <strong>h</strong>, or <strong>mi</strong>, so
that it is computed in years (defined as 365 24-hour days, ignoring leap
years), months (defined as 30 24-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or
minutes, respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is computed in
seconds.</p>
<p>
To unset a date, use <strong>none</strong>, <strong>never</strong>, or <strong>unset</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-P date/offset</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option sets the date on which a key is to be
published to the zone. After that date, the key is included in the
zone but is not used to sign it. If not set, and if the <em>-G</em> option
has not been used, the default is the current date.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>sync date/offset</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the date on which CDS and
CDNSKEY records that match this key are to be published to the zone.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-A date/offset</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the date on which the key is to
be activated. After that date, the key is included in the zone and
used to sign it. If not set, and if the <em>-G</em> option has not been used,
the default is the current date. If set, and <em>-P</em> is not set, the
publication date is set to the activation date minus the
prepublication interval.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-R date/offset</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the date on which the key is to
be revoked. After that date, the key is flagged as revoked. It is
included in the zone and is used to sign it.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-I date/offset</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the date on which the key is to
be retired. After that date, the key is still included in the zone,
but it is not used to sign it.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-D date/offset</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option sets the date on which the key is to
be deleted. After that date, the key is no longer included in the
zone. (However, it may remain in the key repository.)</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>sync date/offset</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the date on which the CDS and
CDNSKEY records that match this key are to be deleted.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-i interval</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the prepublication interval for a
key. If set, then the publication and activation dates must be
separated by at least this much time. If the activation date is
specified but the publication date is not, the publication date
defaults to this much time before the activation date; conversely, if
the publication date is specified but not the activation date,
activation is set to this much time after publication.

If the key is being created as an explicit successor to another key,
then the default prepublication interval is 30 days; otherwise it is
zero.

As with date offsets, if the argument is followed by one of the
suffixes <strong>y</strong>, <strong>mo</strong>, <strong>w</strong>, <strong>d</strong>, <strong>h</strong>, or <strong>mi</strong>, the interval is measured
in years, months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, respectively.
Without a suffix, the interval is measured in seconds.</dd>

GENERATED KEYS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When <strong>dnssec-keygen</strong> completes successfully, it prints a string of the
form <strong>Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii</strong> to the standard output. This is an
identification string for the key it has generated.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>nnnn</strong> is the key name.</li>
<li><strong>aaa</strong> is the numeric representation of the algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>iiiii</strong> is the key identifier (or footprint).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>dnssec-keygen</strong> creates two files, with names based on the printed
string. <strong>Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key</strong> contains the public key, and
<strong>Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private</strong> contains the private key.</p>
<p>
The <strong>.key</strong> file contains a DNSKEY or KEY record. When a zone is being
signed by <em>named</em> or <em>dnssec-signzone -S</em>, DNSKEY records are included
automatically. In other cases, the <strong>.key</strong> file can be inserted into a
zone file manually or with an <strong>$INCLUDE</strong> statement.</p>
<p>
The <strong>.private</strong> file contains algorithm-specific fields. For obvious
security reasons, this file does not have general read permission.</p>
