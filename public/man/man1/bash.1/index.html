DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>Bash</strong> is an <strong>sh</strong>-compatible command language interpreter that executes
commands read from the standard input or from a file. <strong>Bash</strong> also
incorporates useful features from the <em>Korn</em> and <em>C</em> shells (<strong>ksh</strong> and
<strong>csh</strong>).</p>
<p>
<strong>Bash</strong> is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and
Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard
1003.1). <strong>Bash</strong> can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default.</p>

<h2 id="headline-5">
OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>All of the single-character shell options documented in the description
of the <strong>set</strong> builtin command, including <strong>-o</strong>, can be used as options
when the shell is invoked. In addition, <strong>bash</strong> interprets the following
options when it is invoked:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-c</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If the <strong>-c</strong> option is present, then commands are read from the
first non-option argument <em>command_string</em>. If there are arguments
after the <em>command_string</em>, the first argument is assigned to <strong>$0</strong> and
any remaining arguments are assigned to the positional parameters. The
assignment to <strong>$0</strong> sets the name of the shell, which is used in
warning and error messages.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-i</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If the <strong>-i</strong> option is present, the shell is <em>interactive</em>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-l</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Make <strong>bash</strong> act as if it had been invoked as a login shell
(see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>INVOCATION</strong> below).</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-r</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If the <strong>-r</strong> option is present, the shell becomes <em>restricted</em>
(see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>RESTRICTED SHELL</strong> below).</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-s</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If the <strong>-s</strong> option is present, or if no arguments remain after
option processing, then commands are read from the standard input.
This option allows the positional parameters to be set when invoking
an interactive shell or when reading input through a pipe.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-D</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A list of all double-quoted strings preceded by <strong>$</strong> is printed
on the standard output. These are the strings that are subject to
language translation when the current locale is not <strong>C</strong> or <strong>POSIX</strong>.
This implies the <strong>-n</strong> option; no commands will be executed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>[-+]O [/shopt_option/]</strong>
</dt>
<dd><em>shopt_option</em> is one of the shell options
accepted by the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin (see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below). If <em>shopt_option</em> is present, <strong>-O</strong> sets
the value of that option; <strong>+O</strong> unsets it. If <em>shopt_option</em> is not
supplied, the names and values of the shell options accepted by <strong>shopt</strong>
are printed on the standard output. If the invocation option is <strong>+O</strong>,
the output is displayed in a format that may be reused as input.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>–</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A <strong>–</strong> signals the end of options and disables further option
processing. Any arguments after the <strong>–</strong> are treated as filenames and
arguments. An argument of <strong>-</strong> is equivalent to <strong>–</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Bash</strong> also interprets a number of multi-character options. These
options must appear on the command line before the single-character
options to be recognized.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>–debugger</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Arrange for the debugger profile to be executed before
the shell starts. Turns on extended debugging mode (see the
description of the <strong>extdebug</strong> option to the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin below).</dd>

ARGUMENTS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>If arguments remain after option processing, and neither the <strong>-c</strong> nor
the <strong>-s</strong> option has been supplied, the first argument is assumed to be
the name of a file containing shell commands. If <strong>bash</strong> is invoked in
this fashion, <strong>$0</strong> is set to the name of the file, and the positional
parameters are set to the remaining arguments. <strong>Bash</strong> reads and executes
commands from this file, then exits. <strong>Bash</strong>&#39;s exit status is the exit
status of the last command executed in the script. If no commands are
executed, the exit status is 0. An attempt is first made to open the
file in the current directory, and, if no file is found, then the shell
searches the directories in</p>
<p>
<strong>PATH</strong> for the script.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-7">
INVOCATION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>A <em>login shell</em> is one whose first character of argument zero is a <strong>-</strong>,
or one started with the <strong>–login</strong> option.</p>
<p>
An <em>interactive</em> shell is one started without non-option arguments
(unless <strong>-s</strong> is specified) and without the <strong>-c</strong> option, whose standard
input and error are both connected to terminals (as determined by
/isatty/(3)), or one started with the <strong>-i</strong> option.</p>
<p>
<strong>PS1</strong> is set and <strong>$-</strong> includes <strong>i</strong> if <strong>bash</strong> is interactive, allowing a
shell script or a startup file to test this state.</p>
<p>
The following paragraphs describe how <strong>bash</strong> executes its startup files.
If any of the files exist but cannot be read, <strong>bash</strong> reports an error.
Tildes are expanded in filenames as described below under <strong>Tilde
Expansion</strong> in the</p>
<p>
<strong>EXPANSION</strong> section.</p>
<p>
When <strong>bash</strong> is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a
non-interactive shell with the <strong>–login</strong> option, it first reads and
executes commands from the file <em>/etc/profile</em>, if that file exists.
After reading that file, it looks for <em>~</em>.bash_profile/,
<em>~</em>.bash_login/, and <em>~</em>.profile/, in that order, and reads and executes
commands from the first one that exists and is readable. The
<strong>–noprofile</strong> option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit
this behavior.</p>
<p>
When an interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login shell
executes the <strong>exit</strong> builtin command, <strong>bash</strong> reads and executes commands
from the file <em>~</em>.bash_logout/, if it exists.</p>
<p>
When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, <strong>bash</strong>
reads and executes commands from <em>~</em>.bashrc/, if that file exists. This
may be inhibited by using the <strong>–norc</strong> option. The <strong>–rcfile</strong> <em>file</em>
option will force <strong>bash</strong> to read and execute commands from <em>file</em>
instead of <em>~</em>.bashrc/.</p>
<p>
When <strong>bash</strong> is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for
example, it looks for the variable</p>
<p>
<strong>BASH_ENV</strong> in the environment, expands its value if it appears there,
and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute.
<strong>Bash</strong> behaves as if the following command were executed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if [ -n &#34;$BASH_ENV&#34; ]; then . &#34;$BASH_ENV&#34;; fi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
but the value of the</p>
<p>
<strong>PATH</strong> variable is not used to search for the filename.</p>
<p>
If <strong>bash</strong> is invoked with the name <strong>sh</strong>, it tries to mimic the startup
behavior of historical versions of <strong>sh</strong> as closely as possible, while
conforming to the POSIX standard as well. When invoked as an interactive
login shell, or a non-interactive shell with the <strong>–login</strong> option, it
first attempts to read and execute commands from <em>/etc/profile</em> and
<em>~</em>.profile/, in that order. The <strong>–noprofile</strong> option may be used to
inhibit this behavior. When invoked as an interactive shell with the
name <strong>sh</strong>, <strong>bash</strong> looks for the variable</p>
<p>
<strong>ENV</strong>, expands its value if it is defined, and uses the expanded value
as the name of a file to read and execute. Since a shell invoked as <strong>sh</strong>
does not attempt to read and execute commands from any other startup
files, the <strong>–rcfile</strong> option has no effect. A non-interactive shell
invoked with the name <strong>sh</strong> does not attempt to read any other startup
files. When invoked as <strong>sh</strong>, <strong>bash</strong> enters <em>posix</em> mode after the
startup files are read.</p>
<p>
When <strong>bash</strong> is started in <em>posix</em> mode, as with the <strong>–posix</strong> command
line option, it follows the POSIX standard for startup files. In this
mode, interactive shells expand the</p>
<p>
<strong>ENV</strong> variable and commands are read and executed from the file whose
name is the expanded value. No other startup files are read.</p>
<p>
<strong>Bash</strong> attempts to determine when it is being run with its standard
input connected to a network connection, as when executed by the
historical remote shell daemon, usually <em>rshd</em>, or the secure shell
daemon <em>sshd</em>. If <strong>bash</strong> determines it is being run non-interactively in
this fashion, it reads and executes commands from <em>~</em>.bashrc/, if that
file exists and is readable. It will not do this if invoked as <strong>sh</strong>. The
<strong>–norc</strong> option may be used to inhibit this behavior, and the <strong>–rcfile</strong>
option may be used to force another file to be read, but neither <em>rshd</em>
nor <em>sshd</em> generally invoke the shell with those options or allow them
to be specified.</p>
<p>
If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to
the real user (group) id, and the <strong>-p</strong> option is not supplied, no
startup files are read, shell functions are not inherited from the
environment, the</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELLOPTS</strong>,</p>
<p>
<strong>BASHOPTS</strong>,</p>
<p>
<strong>CDPATH</strong>, and</p>
<p>
<strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong> variables, if they appear in the environment, are ignored,
and the effective user id is set to the real user id. If the <strong>-p</strong> option
is supplied at invocation, the startup behavior is the same, but the
effective user id is not reset.</p>

Simple Commands
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-3">
<p>A <em>simple command</em> is a sequence of optional variable assignments
followed by <strong>blank</strong>-separated words and redirections, and terminated by
a <em>control operator</em>. The first word specifies the command to be
executed, and is passed as argument zero. The remaining words are passed
as arguments to the invoked command.</p>
<p>
The return value of a <em>simple command</em> is its exit status, or 128+/n /
if the command is terminated by signal <em>n</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-12" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-12">
Pipelines
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-3">
<p>A <em>pipeline</em> is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of
the control operators <strong>|</strong> or <strong>|&amp;</strong>. The format for a pipeline is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[*time* [*-p*]] [ ! ] <em>command1</em> [ [*|*⎪*|&amp;*] <em>command2</em> … ]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The standard output of <em>command1</em> is connected via a pipe to the
standard input of <em>command2</em>. This connection is performed before any
redirections specified by the /command1/(see</p>
<p>
<strong>REDIRECTION</strong> below). If <strong>|&amp;</strong> is used, <em>command1</em>&#39;s standard error, in
addition to its standard output, is connected to <em>command2</em>&#39;s standard
input through the pipe; it is shorthand for <strong>2&gt;&amp;1 |</strong>. This implicit
redirection of the standard error to the standard output is performed
after any redirections specified by <em>command1</em>.</p>
<p>
The return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command,
unless the <strong>pipefail</strong> option is enabled. If <strong>pipefail</strong> is enabled, the
pipeline&#39;s return status is the value of the last (rightmost) command to
exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit successfully.
If the reserved word <strong>!</strong> precedes a pipeline, the exit status of that
pipeline is the logical negation of the exit status as described above.
The shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to terminate before
returning a value.</p>
<p>
If the <strong>time</strong> reserved word precedes a pipeline, the elapsed as well as
user and system time consumed by its execution are reported when the
pipeline terminates. The <strong>-p</strong> option changes the output format to that
specified by POSIX. When the shell is in <em>posix mode</em>, it does not
recognize <strong>time</strong> as a reserved word if the next token begins with a `-&#39;.
The</p>
<p>
<strong>TIMEFORMAT</strong> variable may be set to a format string that specifies how
the timing information should be displayed; see the description of</p>
<p>
<strong>TIMEFORMAT</strong> under <strong>Shell Variables</strong> below.</p>
<p>
When the shell is in <em>posix mode</em>, <strong>time</strong> may be followed by a newline.
In this case, the shell displays the total user and system time consumed
by the shell and its children. The</p>
<p>
<strong>TIMEFORMAT</strong> variable may be used to specify the format of the time
information.</p>
<p>
Each command in a multi-command pipeline, where pipes are created, is
executed in a <em>subshell</em>, which is a separate process. See</p>
<p>
<strong>COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT</strong> for a description of subshells and a
subshell environment. If the <strong>lastpipe</strong> option is enabled using the
<strong>shopt</strong> builtin (see the description of <strong>shopt</strong> below), the last element
of a pipeline may be run by the shell process when job control is not
active.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-13" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-13">
Lists
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-3">
<p>A <em>list</em> is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the
operators <strong>;</strong>, <strong>&amp;</strong>, <strong>&amp;&amp;</strong>, or <strong>||</strong>, and optionally terminated by one of
<strong>;</strong>, <strong>&amp;</strong>, or <strong>&lt;newline&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>
Of these list operators, <strong>&amp;&amp;</strong> and <strong>||</strong> have equal precedence, followed
by <strong>;</strong> and <strong>&amp;</strong>, which have equal precedence.</p>
<p>
A sequence of one or more newlines may appear in a <em>list</em> instead of a
semicolon to delimit commands.</p>
<p>
If a command is terminated by the control operator <strong>&amp;</strong>, the shell
executes the command in the <em>background</em> in a subshell. The shell does
not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0. These
are referred to as <em>asynchronous</em> commands. Commands separated by a <strong>;</strong>
are executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to terminate
in turn. The return status is the exit status of the last command
executed.</p>
<p>
AND and OR lists are sequences of one or more pipelines separated by the
<strong>&amp;&amp;</strong> and <strong>||</strong> control operators, respectively. AND and OR lists are
executed with left associativity. An AND list has the form</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>command1</em> <strong>&amp;&amp;</strong> <em>command2</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>command2</em> is executed if, and only if, <em>command1</em> returns an exit
status of zero (success).</p>
<p>
An OR list has the form</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>command1</em> <strong>||</strong> <em>command2</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>command2</em> is executed if, and only if, <em>command1</em> returns a non-zero
exit status. The return status of AND and OR lists is the exit status of
the last command executed in the list.</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-14" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-14">
Compound Commands
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-3">
<p>A <em>compound command</em> is one of the following. In most cases a <em>list</em> in
a command&#39;s description may be separated from the rest of the command by
one or more newlines, and may be followed by a newline in place of a
semicolon.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
(<em>list</em>)
</dt>
<dd><em>list</em> is executed in a subshell (see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT</strong> below for a description of a subshell
environment). Variable assignments and builtin commands that affect the
shell&#39;s environment do not remain in effect after the command completes.
The return status is the exit status of <em>list</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
{ <em>list</em>; }
</dt>
<dd><em>list</em> is simply executed in the current shell
environment. <em>list</em> must be terminated with a newline or semicolon.
This is known as a <em>group command</em>. The return status is the exit
status of <em>list</em>. Note that unlike the metacharacters <strong>(</strong> and <strong>)</strong>, <strong>{</strong>
and <strong>}</strong> are <em>reserved words</em> and must occur where a reserved word is
permitted to be recognized. Since they do not cause a word break, they
must be separated from <em>list</em> by whitespace or another shell
metacharacter.</dd>
<dt>
((<em>expression</em>))
</dt>
<dd>The <em>expression</em> is evaluated according to the
rules described below under</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>ARITHMETIC EVALUATION</strong>. If the value of the expression is non-zero, the
return status is 0; otherwise the return status is 1. The <em>expression</em>
undergoes the same expansions as if it were within double quotes, but
double quote characters in <em>expression</em> are not treated specially and
are removed.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>[[</strong> <em>expression</em> <strong>]]</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Return a status of 0 or 1 depending on the
evaluation of the conditional expression <em>expression</em>. Expressions are
composed of the primaries described below under</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS</strong>. The words between the <strong>[[</strong> and <strong>]]</strong> do not
undergo word splitting and pathname expansion. The shell performs tilde
expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion,
command substitution, process substitution, and quote removal on those
words (the expansions that would occur if the words were enclosed in
double quotes). Conditional operators such as <strong>-f</strong> must be unquoted to
be recognized as primaries.</p>
<p>
When used with <strong>[[</strong>, the <strong>&lt;</strong> and <strong>&gt;</strong> operators sort lexicographically
using the current locale.</p>
<p>
When the <strong>==</strong> and <strong>!=</strong> operators are used, the string to the right of
the operator is considered a pattern and matched according to the rules
described below under <strong>Pattern Matching</strong>, as if the <strong>extglob</strong> shell
option were enabled. The <strong>=</strong> operator is equivalent to <strong>==</strong>. If the
<strong>nocasematch</strong> shell option is enabled, the match is performed without
regard to the case of alphabetic characters. The return value is 0 if
the string matches (<strong>==</strong>) or does not match (<strong>!=</strong>) the pattern, and 1
otherwise. Any part of the pattern may be quoted to force the quoted
portion to be matched as a string.</p>
<p>
An additional binary operator, <strong>=~</strong>, is available, with the same
precedence as <strong>==</strong> and <strong>!=</strong>. When it is used, the string to the right of
the operator is considered a POSIX extended regular expression and
matched accordingly (using the POSIX <em>regcomp</em> and <em>regexec</em> interfaces
usually described in /regex/(3)). The return value is 0 if the string
matches the pattern, and 1 otherwise. If the regular expression is
syntactically incorrect, the conditional expression&#39;s return value is 2.
If the <strong>nocasematch</strong> shell option is enabled, the match is performed
without regard to the case of alphabetic characters. If any part of the
pattern is quoted, the quoted portion is matched literally. This means
every character in the quoted portion matches itself, instead of having
any special pattern matching meaning. If the pattern is stored in a
shell variable, quoting the variable expansion forces the entire pattern
to be matched literally. Treat bracket expressions in regular
expressions carefully, since normal quoting and pattern characters lose
their meanings between brackets.</p>
<p>
The pattern will match if it matches any part of the string. Anchor the
pattern using the <strong>^</strong> and <strong>$</strong> regular expression operators to force it
to match the entire string. The array variable</p>
<p>
<strong>BASH_REMATCH</strong> records which parts of the string matched the pattern.
The element of</p>
<p>
<strong>BASH_REMATCH</strong> with index 0 contains the portion of the string matching
the entire regular expression. Substrings matched by parenthesized
subexpressions within the regular expression are saved in the remaining</p>
<p>
<strong>BASH_REMATCH</strong> indices. The element of</p>
<p>
<strong>BASH_REMATCH</strong> with index <em>n</em> is the portion of the string matching the
/n/th parenthesized subexpression. Bash sets</p>
<p>
<strong>BASH_REMATCH</strong> in the global scope; declaring it as a local variable
will lead to unexpected results.</p>
<p>
Expressions may be combined using the following operators, listed in
decreasing order of precedence:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>

expansion, command substitution, process substitution and quote
removal. Each <em>pattern</em> examined is expanded using tilde expansion,

the corresponding <em>list</em> is executed. If the <strong>;;</strong> operator is used, no
subsequent matches are attempted after the first pattern match. Using

causes the shell to test the next pattern list in the statement, if
any, and execute any associated <em>list</em> on a successful match,

Coprocesses
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-3">
<p>A <em>coprocess</em> is a shell command preceded by the <strong>coproc</strong> reserved word.
A coprocess is executed asynchronously in a subshell, as if the command
had been terminated with the <strong>&amp;</strong> control operator, with a two-way pipe
established between the executing shell and the coprocess.</p>
<p>
The syntax for a coprocess is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>coproc</strong> [/NAME/] <em>command</em> [/redirections/]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This creates a coprocess named <em>NAME</em>. <em>command</em> may be either a simple
command or a compound command (see above). <em>NAME</em> is a shell variable
name. If <em>NAME</em> is not supplied, the default name is <strong>COPROC</strong>.</p>
<p>
The recommended form to use for a coprocess is</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>coproc</strong> <em>NAME</em> { <em>command</em> [/redirections/]; }</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This form is recommended because simple commands result in the coprocess
always being named <strong>COPROC</strong>, and it is simpler to use and more complete
than the other compound commands.</p>
<p>
If <em>command</em> is a compound command, <em>NAME</em> is optional. The word
following <strong>coproc</strong> determines whether that word is interpreted as a
variable name: it is interpreted as <em>NAME</em> if it is not a reserved word
that introduces a compound command. If <em>command</em> is a simple command,
<em>NAME</em> is not allowed; this is to avoid confusion between <em>NAME</em> and the
first word of the simple command.</p>
<p>
When the coprocess is executed, the shell creates an array variable (see
<strong>Arrays</strong> below) named <em>NAME</em> in the context of the executing shell. The
standard output of <em>command</em> is connected via a pipe to a file
descriptor in the executing shell, and that file descriptor is assigned
to <em>NAME</em>[0]. The standard input of <em>command</em> is connected via a pipe to
a file descriptor in the executing shell, and that file descriptor is
assigned to <em>NAME</em>[1]. This pipe is established before any redirections
specified by the command (see</p>
<p>
<strong>REDIRECTION</strong> below). The file descriptors can be utilized as arguments
to shell commands and redirections using standard word expansions. Other
than those created to execute command and process substitutions, the
file descriptors are not available in subshells.</p>
<p>
The process ID of the shell spawned to execute the coprocess is
available as the value of the variable /NAME/_PID. The <strong>wait</strong> builtin
command may be used to wait for the coprocess to terminate.</p>
<p>
Since the coprocess is created as an asynchronous command, the <strong>coproc</strong>
command always returns success. The return status of a coprocess is the
exit status of <em>command</em>.</p>

Shell Function Definitions
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-16" class="outline-text-3">
<p>A shell function is an object that is called like a simple command and
executes a compound command with a new set of positional parameters.
Shell functions are declared as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<em>fname</em> () <em>compound-command</em> [/redirection/]
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
<strong>function</strong> <em>fname</em> [()] <em>compound-command</em> [/redirection/]
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>This defines a function named <em>fname</em>. The reserved word <strong>function</strong> is
optional. If the <strong>function</strong> reserved word is supplied, the parentheses
are optional. The <em>body</em> of the function is the compound command
<em>compound-command</em> (see <strong>Compound Commands</strong> above). That command is
usually a <em>list</em> of commands between { and }, but may be any command
listed under <strong>Compound Commands</strong> above. If the <strong>function</strong> reserved word
is used, but the parentheses are not supplied, the braces are
recommended. <em>compound-command</em> is executed whenever <em>fname</em> is
specified as the name of a simple command. When in <em>posix mode</em>, <em>fname</em>
must be a valid shell <em>name</em> and may not be the name of one of the POSIX
<em>special builtins</em>. In default mode, a function name can be any unquoted
shell word that does not contain <strong>$</strong>. Any redirections (see</p>
<p>
<strong>REDIRECTION</strong> below) specified when a function is defined are performed
when the function is executed. The exit status of a function definition
is zero unless a syntax error occurs or a readonly function with the
same name already exists. When executed, the exit status of a function
is the exit status of the last command executed in the body. (See</p>

<h2 id="headline-18">
QUOTING
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-18" class="outline-text-2">
<p><em>Quoting</em> is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or
words to the shell. Quoting can be used to disable special treatment for
special characters, to prevent reserved words from being recognized as
such, and to prevent parameter expansion.</p>
<p>
Each of the <em>metacharacters</em> listed above under</p>
<p>
<strong>DEFINITIONS</strong> has special meaning to the shell and must be quoted if it
is to represent itself.</p>
<p>
When the command history expansion facilities are being used (see</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTORY EXPANSION</strong> below), the <em>history expansion</em> character, usually
<strong>!</strong>, must be quoted to prevent history expansion.</p>
<p>
There are three quoting mechanisms: the <em>escape character</em>, single
quotes, and double quotes.</p>
<p>
A non-quoted backslash (<strong>\</strong>) is the <em>escape character</em>. It preserves the
literal value of the next character that follows, with the exception of
&lt;newline&gt;. If a *\*&lt;newline&gt; pair appears, and the backslash is not
itself quoted, the *\*&lt;newline&gt; is treated as a line continuation (that
is, it is removed from the input stream and effectively ignored).</p>
<p>
Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal value of
each character within the quotes. A single quote may not occur between
single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.</p>
<p>
Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of all
characters within the quotes, with the exception of <strong>$</strong>, <strong>`</strong>, <strong>\</strong>, and,
when history expansion is enabled, <strong>!</strong>. When the shell is in <em>posix
mode</em>, the <strong>!</strong> has no special meaning within double quotes, even when
history expansion is enabled. The characters <strong>$</strong> and <strong>`</strong> retain their
special meaning within double quotes. The backslash retains its special
meaning only when followed by one of the following characters: <strong>$</strong>, <strong>`</strong>,
 <strong>&#34;</strong> , <strong>\</strong>, or <strong>&lt;newline&gt;</strong>. A double quote may be quoted within double
quotes by preceding it with a backslash. If enabled, history expansion
will be performed unless an <strong>!</strong> appearing in double quotes is escaped
using a backslash. The backslash preceding the <strong>!</strong> is not removed.</p>
<p>
The special parameters <strong>*</strong> and <strong>@</strong> have special meaning when in double
quotes (see</p>
<p>
<strong>PARAMETERS</strong> below).</p>
<p>
Character sequences of the form <strong>$</strong>&#39;<em>string</em>&#39; are treated as a special
variant of single quotes. The sequence expands to <em>string</em>, with
backslash-escaped characters in <em>string</em> replaced as specified by the
ANSI C standard. Backslash escape sequences, if present, are decoded as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
The expanded result is single-quoted, as if the dollar sign had not been
present.</p>
<p>
A double-quoted string preceded by a dollar sign (<strong>$</strong>&#34;<em>string</em>&#34;) will
cause the string to be translated according to the current locale. The
<em>gettext</em> infrastructure performs the lookup and translation, using the
<strong>LC_MESSAGES</strong>, <strong>TEXTDOMAINDIR</strong>, and <strong>TEXTDOMAIN</strong> shell variables. If the
current locale is <strong>C</strong> or <strong>POSIX</strong>, if there are no translations
available, or if the string is not translated, the dollar sign is
ignored. This is a form of double quoting, so the string remains
double-quoted by default, whether or not it is translated and replaced.
If the <strong>noexpand_translation</strong> option is enabled using the <strong>shopt</strong>
builtin, translated strings are single-quoted instead of double-quoted.

PARAMETERS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-19" class="outline-text-2">
<p>A <em>parameter</em> is an entity that stores values. It can be a <em>name</em>, a
number, or one of the special characters listed below under <strong>Special
Parameters</strong>. A <em>variable</em> is a parameter denoted by a <em>name</em>. A variable
has a <em>value</em> and zero or more <em>attributes</em>. Attributes are assigned
using the <strong>declare</strong> builtin command (see <strong>declare</strong> below in</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong>).</p>
<p>
A parameter is set if it has been assigned a value. The null string is a
valid value. Once a variable is set, it may be unset only by using the
<strong>unset</strong> builtin command (see</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below).</p>
<p>
A <em>variable</em> may be assigned to by a statement of the form</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/name/=[/value/]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If <em>value</em> is not given, the variable is assigned the null string. All
<em>values</em> undergo tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion,
command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal (see</p>
<p>
<strong>EXPANSION</strong> below). If the variable has its <strong>integer</strong> attribute set,
then <em>value</em> is evaluated as an arithmetic expression even if the
$((…)) expansion is not used (see <strong>Arithmetic Expansion</strong> below). Word
splitting and pathname expansion are not performed. Assignment
statements may also appear as arguments to the <strong>alias</strong>, <strong>declare</strong>,
<strong>typeset</strong>, <strong>export</strong>, <strong>readonly</strong>, and <strong>local</strong> builtin commands
(<em>declaration</em> commands). When in <em>posix mode</em>, these builtins may
appear in a command after one or more instances of the <strong>command</strong> builtin
and retain these assignment statement properties.</p>
<p>
In the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value to a
shell variable or array index, the += operator can be used to append to
or add to the variable&#39;s previous value. This includes arguments to
builtin commands such as <strong>declare</strong> that accept assignment statements
(<em>declaration</em> commands). When += is applied to a variable for which the
<strong>integer</strong> attribute has been set, <em>value</em> is evaluated as an arithmetic
expression and added to the variable&#39;s current value, which is also
evaluated. When += is applied to an array variable using compound
assignment (see <strong>Arrays</strong> below), the variable&#39;s value is not unset (as
it is when using =), and new values are appended to the array beginning
at one greater than the array&#39;s maximum index (for indexed arrays) or
added as additional key-value pairs in an associative array. When
applied to a string-valued variable, <em>value</em> is expanded and appended to
the variable&#39;s value.</p>
<p>
A variable can be assigned the <em>nameref</em> attribute using the <strong>-n</strong> option
to the <strong>declare</strong> or <strong>local</strong> builtin commands (see the descriptions of
<strong>declare</strong> and <strong>local</strong> below) to create a <em>nameref</em>, or a reference to
another variable. This allows variables to be manipulated indirectly.
Whenever the nameref variable is referenced, assigned to, unset, or has
its attributes modified (other than using or changing the <em>nameref</em>
attribute itself), the operation is actually performed on the variable
specified by the nameref variable&#39;s value. A nameref is commonly used
within shell functions to refer to a variable whose name is passed as an
argument to the function. For instance, if a variable name is passed to
a shell function as its first argument, running</p>
<blockquote>
<p>declare -n ref=$1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
inside the function creates a nameref variable <strong>ref</strong> whose value is the
variable name passed as the first argument. References and assignments
to <strong>ref</strong>, and changes to its attributes, are treated as references,
assignments, and attribute modifications to the variable whose name was
passed as <strong>$1</strong>. If the control variable in a <strong>for</strong> loop has the nameref
attribute, the list of words can be a list of shell variables, and a
name reference will be established for each word in the list, in turn,
when the loop is executed. Array variables cannot be given the <strong>nameref</strong>
attribute. However, nameref variables can reference array variables and
subscripted array variables. Namerefs can be unset using the <strong>-n</strong> option
to the <strong>unset</strong> builtin. Otherwise, if <strong>unset</strong> is executed with the name
of a nameref variable as an argument, the variable referenced by the
nameref variable will be unset.</p>

Positional Parameters
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-20" class="outline-text-3">
<p>A <em>positional parameter</em> is a parameter denoted by one or more digits,
other than the single digit 0. Positional parameters are assigned from
the shell&#39;s arguments when it is invoked, and may be reassigned using
the <strong>set</strong> builtin command. Positional parameters may not be assigned to
with assignment statements. The positional parameters are temporarily
replaced when a shell function is executed (see</p>
<p>

<dt>
<strong>BASHOPTS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A colon-separated list of enabled shell options. Each
word in the list is a valid argument for the <strong>-s</strong> option to the
<strong>shopt</strong> builtin command (see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below). The options appearing in</p>
<p>
<strong>BASHOPTS</strong> are those reported as <em>on</em> by <strong>shopt</strong>. If this variable is in
the environment when <strong>bash</strong> starts up, each shell option in the list
will be enabled before reading any startup files. This variable is
read-only.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>BASHPID</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Expands to the process ID of the current <strong>bash</strong> process.
This differs from <strong>$$</strong> under certain circumstances, such as subshells
that do not require <strong>bash</strong> to be re-initialized. Assignments to</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>BASHPID</strong> have no effect. If <strong>BASHPID</strong> is unset, it loses its special
properties, even if it is subsequently reset.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>BASH_ALIASES</strong>
</dt>
<dd>An associative array variable whose members
correspond to the internal list of aliases as maintained by the
<strong>alias</strong> builtin. Elements added to this array appear in the alias
list; however, unsetting array elements currently does not cause
aliases to be removed from the alias list. If <strong>BASH_ALIASES</strong> is unset,
it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>BASH_ARGC</strong>
</dt>
<dd>An array variable whose values are the number of
parameters in each frame of the current <strong>bash</strong> execution call stack.
The number of parameters to the current subroutine (shell function or
script executed with <strong>.</strong> or <strong>source</strong>) is at the top of the stack. When
a subroutine is executed, the number of parameters passed is pushed
onto</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>BASH_ARGC</strong>. The shell sets</p>
<p>
<strong>BASH_ARGC</strong> only when in extended debugging mode (see the description of
the <strong>extdebug</strong> option to the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin below). Setting <strong>extdebug</strong>
after the shell has started to execute a script, or referencing this
variable when <strong>extdebug</strong> is not set, may result in inconsistent values.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>BASH_ARGV</strong>
</dt>
<dd>An array variable containing all of the parameters in
the current <strong>bash</strong> execution call stack. The final parameter of the
last subroutine call is at the top of the stack; the first parameter
of the initial call is at the bottom. When a subroutine is executed,
the parameters supplied are pushed onto</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>BASH_ARGV</strong>. The shell sets</p>
<p>
<strong>BASH_ARGV</strong> only when in extended debugging mode (see the description of
the <strong>extdebug</strong> option to the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin below). Setting <strong>extdebug</strong>
after the shell has started to execute a script, or referencing this
variable when <strong>extdebug</strong> is not set, may result in inconsistent values.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>BASH_ARGV0</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When referenced, this variable expands to the name of
the shell or shell script (identical to <strong>$0</strong>; see the description of
special parameter 0 above). Assignment to <strong>BASH_ARGV0</strong> causes the
value assigned to also be assigned to <strong>$0</strong>. If <strong>BASH_ARGV0</strong> is unset,
it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>BASH_CMDS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>An associative array variable whose members correspond
to the internal hash table of commands as maintained by the <strong>hash</strong>
builtin. Elements added to this array appear in the hash table;
however, unsetting array elements currently does not cause command
names to be removed from the hash table. If <strong>BASH_CMDS</strong> is unset, it
loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>BASH_COMMAND</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The command currently being executed or about to be
executed, unless the shell is executing a command as the result of a
trap, in which case it is the command executing at the time of the
trap. If <strong>BASH_COMMAND</strong> is unset, it loses its special properties,
even if it is subsequently reset.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>BASH_EXECUTION_STRING</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The command argument to the <strong>-c</strong> invocation
option.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>BASH_LINENO</strong>
</dt>
<dd>An array variable whose members are the line numbers
in source files where each corresponding member of</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>FUNCNAME</strong> was invoked. <strong>${BASH_LINENO[*/$i/*]}</strong> is the line number in
the source file (<strong>${BASH_SOURCE[*/$i+1/*]}</strong>) where <strong>${FUNCNAME[*/$i/*]}</strong>
was called (or <strong>${BASH_LINENO[*/$i-1/*]}</strong> if referenced within another
shell function). Use</p>
<p>
<strong>LINENO</strong> to obtain the current line number.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>BASH_LOADABLES_PATH</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A colon-separated list of directories in
which the shell looks for dynamically loadable builtins specified by
the <strong>enable</strong> command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>BASH_REMATCH</strong>
</dt>
<dd>An array variable whose members are assigned by the
<strong>=~</strong> binary operator to the <strong>[[</strong> conditional command. The element with
index 0 is the portion of the string matching the entire regular
expression. The element with index <em>n</em> is the portion of the string
matching the /n/th parenthesized subexpression.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>BASH_SOURCE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>An array variable whose members are the source
filenames where the corresponding shell function names in the</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>FUNCNAME</strong> array variable are defined. The shell function
<strong>${FUNCNAME[*/$i/*]}</strong> is defined in the file <strong>${BASH_SOURCE[*/$i/*]}</strong>
and called from <strong>${BASH_SOURCE[*/$i+1/*]}</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>BASH_SUBSHELL</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Incremented by one within each subshell or subshell
environment when the shell begins executing in that environment. The
initial value is 0. If <strong>BASH_SUBSHELL</strong> is unset, it loses its special
properties, even if it is subsequently reset.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>BASH_VERSINFO</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A readonly array variable whose members hold
version information for this instance of <strong>bash</strong>. The values assigned
to the array members are as follows:</dd>

programmable completion facilities (see <strong>Programmable Completion</strong>
below).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>COMP_POINT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The index of the current cursor position relative to
the beginning of the current command. If the current cursor position
is at the end of the current command, the value of this variable is
equal to <strong>${#COMP_LINE}</strong>. This variable is available only in shell
functions and external commands invoked by the programmable completion
facilities (see <strong>Programmable Completion</strong> below).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>COMP_TYPE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set to an integer value corresponding to the type of
completion attempted that caused a completion function to be called:
<em>TAB</em>, for normal completion, <em>?</em>, for listing completions after
successive tabs, <em>!</em>, for listing alternatives on partial word
completion, <em>@</em>, to list completions if the word is not unmodified, or
<em>%</em>, for menu completion. This variable is available only in shell
functions and external commands invoked by the programmable completion
facilities (see <strong>Programmable Completion</strong> below).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>COMP_WORDBREAKS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The set of characters that the <strong>readline</strong> library
treats as word separators when performing word completion. If</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>COMP_WORDBREAKS</strong> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it
is subsequently reset.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>COMP_WORDS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>An array variable (see <strong>Arrays</strong> below) consisting of
the individual words in the current command line. The line is split
into words as <strong>readline</strong> would split it, using</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>COMP_WORDBREAKS</strong> as described above. This variable is available only in
shell functions invoked by the programmable completion facilities (see
<strong>Programmable Completion</strong> below).</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>COPROC</strong>
</dt>
<dd>An array variable (see <strong>Arrays</strong> below) created to hold the
file descriptors for output from and input to an unnamed coprocess
(see <strong>Coprocesses</strong> above).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>DIRSTACK</strong>
</dt>
<dd>An array variable (see <strong>Arrays</strong> below) containing the
current contents of the directory stack. Directories appear in the
stack in the order they are displayed by the <strong>dirs</strong> builtin. Assigning
to members of this array variable may be used to modify directories
already in the stack, but the <strong>pushd</strong> and <strong>popd</strong> builtins must be used
to add and remove directories. Assignment to this variable will not
change the current directory. If</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>DIRSTACK</strong> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is
subsequently reset.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>EPOCHREALTIME</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Each time this parameter is referenced, it expands
to the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch (see /time/(3)) as a
floating point value with micro-second granularity. Assignments to</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>EPOCHREALTIME</strong> are ignored. If</p>
<p>
<strong>EPOCHREALTIME</strong> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is
subsequently reset.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>EPOCHSECONDS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Each time this parameter is referenced, it expands
to the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch (see /time/(3)).
Assignments to</dd>

<strong>EPOCHSECONDS</strong> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is
subsequently reset.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>EUID</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Expands to the effective user ID of the current user,
initialized at shell startup. This variable is readonly.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>FUNCNAME</strong>
</dt>
<dd>An array variable containing the names of all shell
functions currently in the execution call stack. The element with
index 0 is the name of any currently-executing shell function. The
bottom-most element (the one with the highest index) is &#34;main&#34;. This
variable exists only when a shell function is executing. Assignments
to</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>FUNCNAME</strong> have no effect. If</p>
<p>
<strong>FUNCNAME</strong> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is
subsequently reset.</p>
<p>
This variable can be used with <strong>BASH_LINENO</strong> and <strong>BASH_SOURCE</strong>. Each
element of <strong>FUNCNAME</strong> has corresponding elements in <strong>BASH_LINENO</strong> and
<strong>BASH_SOURCE</strong> to describe the call stack. For instance,
<strong>${FUNCNAME[*/$i/*]}</strong> was called from the file
<strong>${BASH_SOURCE[*/$i+1/*]}</strong> at line number <strong>${BASH_LINENO[*/$i/*]}</strong>. The
<strong>caller</strong> builtin displays the current call stack using this information.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>GROUPS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>An array variable containing the list of groups of which
the current user is a member. Assignments to</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>GROUPS</strong> have no effect. If</p>
<p>
<strong>GROUPS</strong> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is
subsequently reset.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>HISTCMD</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The history number, or index in the history list, of the
current command. Assignments to</dd>

<strong>HOSTNAME</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Automatically set to the name of the current host.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HOSTTYPE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Automatically set to a string that uniquely describes
the type of machine on which <strong>bash</strong> is executing. The default is
system-dependent.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LINENO</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Each time this parameter is referenced, the shell
substitutes a decimal number representing the current sequential line
number (starting with 1) within a script or function. When not in a
script or function, the value substituted is not guaranteed to be
meaningful. If</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>LINENO</strong> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is
subsequently reset.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>MACHTYPE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Automatically set to a string that fully describes the
system type on which <strong>bash</strong> is executing, in the standard GNU
<em>cpu-company-system</em> format. The default is system-dependent.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MAPFILE</strong>

<dd>An array variable (see <strong>Arrays</strong> below) created to hold
the text read by the <strong>mapfile</strong> builtin when no variable name is
supplied.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>OLDPWD</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The previous working directory as set by the <strong>cd</strong> command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>OPTARG</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The value of the last option argument processed by the

<dd>Automatically set to a string that describes the operating
system on which <strong>bash</strong> is executing. The default is system-dependent.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PIPESTATUS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>An array variable (see <strong>Arrays</strong> below) containing a
list of exit status values from the processes in the
most-recently-executed foreground pipeline (which may contain only a
single command).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PPID</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The process ID of the shell&#39;s parent. This variable is
readonly.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PWD</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The current working directory as set by the <strong>cd</strong> command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>RANDOM</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Each time this parameter is referenced, it expands to a
random integer between 0 and 32767. Assigning a value to</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>RANDOM</strong> initializes (seeds) the sequence of random numbers. If</p>
<p>
<strong>RANDOM</strong> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is
subsequently reset.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>READLINE_ARGUMENT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Any numeric argument given to a readline
command that was defined using &#34;bind -x&#34; (see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below) when it was invoked.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>READLINE_LINE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The contents of the <strong>readline</strong> line buffer, for use
with &#34;bind -x&#34; (see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below).</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>READLINE_MARK</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The position of the mark (saved insertion point) in
the <strong>readline</strong> line buffer, for use with &#34;bind -x&#34; (see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below). The characters between the insertion
point and the mark are often called the <em>region</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>READLINE_POINT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The position of the insertion point in the
<strong>readline</strong> line buffer, for use with &#34;bind -x&#34; (see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below).</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>REPLY</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set to the line of input read by the <strong>read</strong> builtin command
when no arguments are supplied.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SECONDS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Each time this parameter is referenced, it expands to the
number of seconds since shell invocation. If a value is assigned to</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>SECONDS</strong>, the value returned upon subsequent references is the number
of seconds since the assignment plus the value assigned. The number of
seconds at shell invocation and the current time are always determined
by querying the system clock. If</p>
<p>
<strong>SECONDS</strong> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is
subsequently reset.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>SHELLOPTS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A colon-separated list of enabled shell options. Each
word in the list is a valid argument for the <strong>-o</strong> option to the <strong>set</strong>
builtin command (see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below). The options appearing in</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELLOPTS</strong> are those reported as <em>on</em> by <strong>set -o</strong>. If this variable is
in the environment when <strong>bash</strong> starts up, each shell option in the list
will be enabled before reading any startup files. This variable is
read-only.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>SHLVL</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Incremented by one each time an instance of <strong>bash</strong> is
started.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SRANDOM</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This variable expands to a 32-bit pseudo-random number
each time it is referenced. The random number generator is not linear
on systems that support <code class="verbatim">/dev/urandom</code> or <em>arc4random</em>, so each
returned number has no relationship to the numbers preceding it. The
random number generator cannot be seeded, so assignments to this
variable have no effect. If</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>SRANDOM</strong> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is
subsequently reset.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>UID</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Expands to the user ID of the current user, initialized at
shell startup. This variable is readonly.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following variables are used by the shell. In some cases, <strong>bash</strong>
assigns a default value to a variable; these cases are noted below.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>BASH_COMPAT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The value is used to set the shell&#39;s compatibility
level. See</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>SHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE</strong> below for a description of the various
compatibility levels and their effects. The value may be a decimal
number (e.g., 4.2) or an integer (e.g., 42) corresponding to the desired
compatibility level. If <strong>BASH_COMPAT</strong> is unset or set to the empty
string, the compatibility level is set to the default for the current
version. If <strong>BASH_COMPAT</strong> is set to a value that is not one of the valid
compatibility levels, the shell prints an error message and sets the
compatibility level to the default for the current version. The valid
values correspond to the compatibility levels described below under</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE</strong>. For example, 4.2 and 42 are valid values
that correspond to the <strong>compat42</strong> <strong>shopt</strong> option and set the
compatibility level to 42. The current version is also a valid value.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>BASH_ENV</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If this parameter is set when <strong>bash</strong> is executing a
shell script, its value is interpreted as a filename containing
commands to initialize the shell, as in <em>~</em>.bashrc/. The value of</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>BASH_ENV</strong> is subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution,
and arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a filename.</p>
<p>
<strong>PATH</strong> is not used to search for the resultant filename.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>BASH_XTRACEFD</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to an integer corresponding to a valid file
descriptor, <strong>bash</strong> will write the trace output generated when <em>set -x</em>
is enabled to that file descriptor. The file descriptor is closed when</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>BASH_XTRACEFD</strong> is unset or assigned a new value. Unsetting</p>
<p>
<strong>BASH_XTRACEFD</strong> or assigning it the empty string causes the trace output
to be sent to the standard error. Note that setting</p>
<p>
<strong>BASH_XTRACEFD</strong> to 2 (the standard error file descriptor) and then
unsetting it will result in the standard error being closed.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>CDPATH</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The search path for the <strong>cd</strong> command. This is a
colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for
destination directories specified by the <strong>cd</strong> command. A sample value
is &#34;.:~:/usr&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>CHILD_MAX</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set the number of exited child status values for the
shell to remember. Bash will not allow this value to be decreased
below a POSIX-mandated minimum, and there is a maximum value
(currently 8192) that this may not exceed. The minimum value is
system-dependent.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>COLUMNS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Used by the <strong>select</strong> compound command to determine the
terminal width when printing selection lists. Automatically set if the
<strong>checkwinsize</strong> option is enabled or in an interactive shell upon
receipt of a</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>SIGWINCH</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>COMPREPLY</strong>
</dt>
<dd>An array variable from which <strong>bash</strong> reads the possible
completions generated by a shell function invoked by the programmable
completion facility (see <strong>Programmable Completion</strong> below). Each array
element contains one possible completion.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>EMACS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If <strong>bash</strong> finds this variable in the environment when the
shell starts with value &#34;t&#34;, it assumes that the shell is running in
an Emacs shell buffer and disables line editing.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>ENV</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Expanded and executed similarly to</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>BASH_ENV</strong> (see <strong>INVOCATION</strong> above) when an interactive shell is invoked
in <em>posix mode</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>EXECIGNORE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A colon-separated list of shell patterns (see <strong>Pattern
Matching</strong>) defining the list of filenames to be ignored by command
search using <strong>PATH</strong>. Files whose full pathnames match one of these
patterns are not considered executable files for the purposes of
completion and command execution via <strong>PATH</strong> lookup. This does not
affect the behavior of the <strong>[</strong>, <strong>test</strong>, and <strong>[[</strong> commands. Full
pathnames in the command hash table are not subject to <strong>EXECIGNORE</strong>.
Use this variable to ignore shared library files that have the
executable bit set, but are not executable files. The pattern matching
honors the setting of the <strong>extglob</strong> shell option.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>FCEDIT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The default editor for the <strong>fc</strong> builtin command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>FIGNORE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A colon-separated list of suffixes to ignore when
performing filename completion (see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>READLINE</strong> below). A filename whose suffix matches one of the entries in</p>
<p>
<strong>FIGNORE</strong> is excluded from the list of matched filenames. A sample value
is &#34;.o:~&#34;.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>FUNCNEST</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to a numeric value greater than 0, defines a
maximum function nesting level. Function invocations that exceed this
nesting level will cause the current command to abort.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A colon-separated list of patterns defining the set of
file names to be ignored by pathname expansion. If a file name matched
by a pathname expansion pattern also matches one of the patterns in</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong>, it is removed from the list of matches.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>HISTCONTROL</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A colon-separated list of values controlling how
commands are saved on the history list. If the list of values includes
<em>ignorespace</em>, lines which begin with a <strong>space</strong> character are not
saved in the history list. A value of <em>ignoredups</em> causes lines
matching the previous history entry to not be saved. A value of
<em>ignoreboth</em> is shorthand for <em>ignorespace</em> and <em>ignoredups</em>. A value
of <em>erasedups</em> causes all previous lines matching the current line to
be removed from the history list before that line is saved. Any value
not in the above list is ignored. If</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>HISTCONTROL</strong> is unset, or does not include a valid value, all lines
read by the shell parser are saved on the history list, subject to the
value of</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTIGNORE</strong>. The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line compound
command are not tested, and are added to the history regardless of the
value of</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTCONTROL</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>HISTFILE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The name of the file in which command history is saved
(see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>HISTORY</strong> below). The default value is <em>~</em>.bash_history/. If unset, the
command history is not saved when a shell exits.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>HISTFILESIZE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of lines contained in the history
file. When this variable is assigned a value, the history file is
truncated, if necessary, to contain no more than that number of lines
by removing the oldest entries. The history file is also truncated to
this size after writing it when a shell exits. If the value is 0, the
history file is truncated to zero size. Non-numeric values and numeric
values less than zero inhibit truncation. The shell sets the default
value to the value of <strong>HISTSIZE</strong> after reading any startup files.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HISTIGNORE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A colon-separated list of patterns used to decide
which command lines should be saved on the history list. Each pattern
is anchored at the beginning of the line and must match the complete
line (no implicit `***&#39; is appended). Each pattern is tested against
the line after the checks specified by</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>HISTCONTROL</strong> are applied. In addition to the normal shell pattern
matching characters, `*&amp;*&#39; matches the previous history line. `*&amp;*&#39; may
be escaped using a backslash; the backslash is removed before attempting
a match. The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line compound
command are not tested, and are added to the history regardless of the
value of</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTIGNORE</strong>. The pattern matching honors the setting of the <strong>extglob</strong>
shell option.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>HISTSIZE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The number of commands to remember in the command
history (see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>HISTORY</strong> below). If the value is 0, commands are not saved in the
history list. Numeric values less than zero result in every command
being saved on the history list (there is no limit). The shell sets the
default value to 500 after reading any startup files.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>HISTTIMEFORMAT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If this variable is set and not null, its value is
used as a format string for /strftime/(3) to print the time stamp
associated with each history entry displayed by the <strong>history</strong> builtin.
If this variable is set, time stamps are written to the history file
so they may be preserved across shell sessions. This uses the history
comment character to distinguish timestamps from other history lines.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HOME</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The home directory of the current user; the default argument
for the <strong>cd</strong> builtin command. The value of this variable is also used
when performing tilde expansion.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HOSTFILE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Contains the name of a file in the same format as
/ /etc/hosts / that should be read when the shell needs to complete a
hostname. The list of possible hostname completions may be changed
while the shell is running; the next time hostname completion is
attempted after the value is changed, <strong>bash</strong> adds the contents of the
new file to the existing list. If</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>HOSTFILE</strong> is set, but has no value, or does not name a readable file,
<strong>bash</strong> attempts to read / /etc/hosts / to obtain the list of possible
hostname completions. When</p>
<p>
<strong>HOSTFILE</strong> is unset, the hostname list is cleared.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>IFS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The <em>Internal Field Separator</em> that is used for word
splitting after expansion and to split lines into words with the
<strong>read</strong> builtin command. The default value is
``&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;&#39;&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>IGNOREEOF</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Controls the action of an interactive shell on receipt
of an</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>EOF</strong> character as the sole input. If set, the value is the number of
consecutive</p>
<p>
<strong>EOF</strong> characters which must be typed as the first characters on an input
line before <strong>bash</strong> exits. If the variable exists but does not have a
numeric value, or has no value, the default value is 10. If it does not
exist,</p>
<p>
<strong>EOF</strong> signifies the end of input to the shell.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>INPUTRC</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The filename for the <strong>readline</strong> startup file, overriding
the default of / ~/.inputrc / (see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>READLINE</strong> below).</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>INSIDE_EMACS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If this variable appears in the environment when the

buffer and may disable line editing, depending on the value of <strong>TERM</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LANG</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Used to determine the locale category for any category not
specifically selected with a variable starting with <strong>LC_</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LC_ALL</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This variable overrides the value of</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>LANG</strong> and any other <strong>LC_</strong> variable specifying a locale category.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>LC_COLLATE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This variable determines the collation order used when
sorting the results of pathname expansion, and determines the behavior
of range expressions, equivalence classes, and collating sequences
within pathname expansion and pattern matching.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LC_CTYPE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This variable determines the interpretation of
characters and the behavior of character classes within pathname
expansion and pattern matching.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LC_MESSAGES</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This variable determines the locale used to translate
double-quoted strings preceded by a <strong>$</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LC_NUMERIC</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This variable determines the locale category used for
number formatting.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LC_TIME</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This variable determines the locale category used for
data and time formatting.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LINES</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Used by the <strong>select</strong> compound command to determine the
column length for printing selection lists. Automatically set if the
<strong>checkwinsize</strong> option is enabled or in an interactive shell upon
receipt of a</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>SIGWINCH</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>MAIL</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If this parameter is set to a file or directory name and the</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>MAILPATH</strong> variable is not set, <strong>bash</strong> informs the user of the arrival
of mail in the specified file or Maildir-format directory.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>MAILCHECK</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies how often (in seconds) <strong>bash</strong> checks for
mail. The default is 60 seconds. When it is time to check for mail,
the shell does so before displaying the primary prompt. If this
variable is unset, or set to a value that is not a number greater than
or equal to zero, the shell disables mail checking.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MAILPATH</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A colon-separated list of filenames to be checked for
mail. The message to be printed when mail arrives in a particular file
may be specified by separating the filename from the message with a
`?&#39;. When used in the text of the message, <strong>$_</strong> expands to the name of
the current mailfile. Example:

*MAILPATH*=&#39;/var/mail/bfox?&#34;You have mail&#34;:~/shell-mail?&#34;$_ has
mail!&#34;&#39;

<strong>Bash</strong> can be configured to supply a default value for this variable
(there is no value by default), but the location of the user mail
files that it uses is system dependent (e.g., /var/mail/*$USER*).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>OPTERR</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to the value 1, <strong>bash</strong> displays error messages
generated by the <strong>getopts</strong> builtin command (see</dd>

<p><strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below).</p>
<p>
<strong>OPTERR</strong> is initialized to 1 each time the shell is invoked or a shell
script is executed.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>PATH</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The search path for commands. It is a colon-separated list
of directories in which the shell looks for commands (see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>COMMAND EXECUTION</strong> below). A zero-length (null) directory name in the
value of</p>
<p>
<strong>PATH</strong> indicates the current directory. A null directory name may appear
as two adjacent colons, or as an initial or trailing colon. The default
path is system-dependent, and is set by the administrator who installs
<strong>bash</strong>. A common value is</p>
<p>
``/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin&#39;&#39;.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>POSIXLY_CORRECT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If this variable is in the environment when
<strong>bash</strong> starts, the shell enters <em>posix mode</em> before reading the
startup files, as if the <strong>–posix</strong> invocation option had been
supplied. If it is set while the shell is running, <strong>bash</strong> enables
<em>posix mode</em>, as if the command <em>set -o posix</em> had been executed. When
the shell enters <em>posix mode</em>, it sets this variable if it was not
already set.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PROMPT_COMMAND</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If this variable is set, and is an array, the
value of each set element is executed as a command prior to issuing
each primary prompt. If this is set but not an array variable, its
value is used as a command to execute instead.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PROMPT_DIRTRIM</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to a number greater than zero, the value is
used as the number of trailing directory components to retain when
expanding the <strong>\w</strong> and <strong>\W</strong> prompt string escapes (see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>PROMPTING</strong> below). Characters removed are replaced with an ellipsis.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>PS0</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The value of this parameter is expanded (see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>PROMPTING</strong> below) and displayed by interactive shells after reading a
command and before the command is executed.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>PS1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The value of this parameter is expanded (see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>PROMPTING</strong> below) and used as the primary prompt string. The default
value is ``*\s-\v\$ *&#39;&#39;.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>PS2</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The value of this parameter is expanded as with</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>PS1</strong> and used as the secondary prompt string. The default is ``*&gt; *&#39;&#39;.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>PS3</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The value of this parameter is used as the prompt for the
<strong>select</strong> command (see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>SHELL GRAMMAR</strong> above).</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>PS4</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The value of this parameter is expanded as with</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>PS1</strong> and the value is printed before each command <strong>bash</strong> displays
during an execution trace. The first character of the expanded value of</p>
<p>
<strong>PS4</strong> is replicated multiple times, as necessary, to indicate multiple
levels of indirection. The default is ``*+ *&#39;&#39;.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>SHELL</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This variable expands to the full pathname to the shell. If
it is not set when the shell starts, <strong>bash</strong> assigns to it the full
pathname of the current user&#39;s login shell.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>TIMEFORMAT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The value of this parameter is used as a format string
specifying how the timing information for pipelines prefixed with the
<strong>time</strong> reserved word should be displayed. The <strong>%</strong> character introduces
an escape sequence that is expanded to a time value or other
information. The escape sequences and their meanings are as follows;
the braces denote optional portions.</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>%%</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A literal <strong>%</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%[/p/][l]R</strong>

<dd>The elapsed time in seconds.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%[/p/][l]U</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The number of CPU seconds spent in user mode.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%[/p/][l]S</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The number of CPU seconds spent in system mode.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%P</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The CPU percentage, computed as (%U + %S) / %R.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The optional <em>p</em> is a digit specifying the <em>precision</em>, the number of
fractional digits after a decimal point. A value of 0 causes no decimal
point or fraction to be output. At most three places after the decimal
point may be specified; values of <em>p</em> greater than 3 are changed to 3.
If <em>p</em> is not specified, the value 3 is used.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The optional <strong>l</strong> specifies a longer format, including minutes, of the
form <em>MM/m/SS</em>./FF/s. The value of <em>p</em> determines whether or not the

timing information is displayed. A trailing newline is added when the
format string is displayed.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>TMOUT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to a value greater than zero,</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>TMOUT</strong> is treated as the default timeout for the <strong>read</strong> builtin. The
<strong>select</strong> command terminates if input does not arrive after</p>
<p>
<strong>TMOUT</strong> seconds when input is coming from a terminal. In an interactive
shell, the value is interpreted as the number of seconds to wait for a
line of input after issuing the primary prompt. <strong>Bash</strong> terminates after
waiting for that number of seconds if a complete line of input does not
arrive.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>TMPDIR</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set, <strong>bash</strong> uses its value as the name of a directory
in which <strong>bash</strong> creates temporary files for the shell&#39;s use.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>auto_resume</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This variable controls how the shell interacts with
the user and job control. If this variable is set, single word simple
commands without redirections are treated as candidates for resumption
of an existing stopped job. There is no ambiguity allowed; if there is
more than one job beginning with the string typed, the job most
recently accessed is selected. The <em>name</em> of a stopped job, in this
context, is the command line used to start it. If set to the value
<em>exact</em>, the string supplied must match the name of a stopped job
exactly; if set to <em>substring</em>, the string supplied needs to match a
substring of the name of a stopped job. The <em>substring</em> value provides
functionality analogous to the <strong>%?</strong> job identifier (see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>JOB CONTROL</strong> below). If set to any other value, the supplied string
must be a prefix of a stopped job&#39;s name; this provides functionality
analogous to the *%*/string/ job identifier.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>histchars</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The two or three characters which control history
expansion and tokenization (see</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>HISTORY EXPANSION</strong> below). The first character is the <em>history
expansion</em> character, the character which signals the start of a history
expansion, normally `*!*&#39;. The second character is the <em>quick
substitution</em> character, which is used as shorthand for re-running the
previous command entered, substituting one string for another in the
command. The default is `*^*&#39;. The optional third character is the
character which indicates that the remainder of the line is a comment
when found as the first character of a word, normally `*#*&#39;. The history
comment character causes history substitution to be skipped for the
remaining words on the line. It does not necessarily cause the shell
parser to treat the rest of the line as a comment.</p>

<h3 id="headline-23">
Arrays
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-23" class="outline-text-3">
<p><strong>Bash</strong> provides one-dimensional indexed and associative array variables.
Any variable may be used as an indexed array; the <strong>declare</strong> builtin will
explicitly declare an array. There is no maximum limit on the size of an
array, nor any requirement that members be indexed or assigned
contiguously. Indexed arrays are referenced using integers (including
arithmetic expressions) and are zero-based; associative arrays are
referenced using arbitrary strings. Unless otherwise noted, indexed
array indices must be non-negative integers.</p>
<p>
An indexed array is created automatically if any variable is assigned to
using the syntax <em>name</em>[/subscript/]=/value/. The <em>subscript</em> is treated
as an arithmetic expression that must evaluate to a number. To
explicitly declare an indexed array, use <strong>declare -a <em>name</em></strong> (see</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below). <strong>declare -a <em>name</em>[/subscript/]</strong> is
also accepted; the <em>subscript</em> is ignored.</p>
<p>
Associative arrays are created using <strong>declare -A <em>name</em></strong>.</p>
<p>
Attributes may be specified for an array variable using the <strong>declare</strong>
and <strong>readonly</strong> builtins. Each attribute applies to all members of an
array.</p>
<p>
Arrays are assigned to using compound assignments of the form
<em>name/=*(*value/1</em> … value/n/*)*, where each <em>value</em> may be of the
form [/subscript/]=/string/. Indexed array assignments do not require
anything but <em>string</em>. Each <em>value</em> in the list is expanded using all
the shell expansions described below under</p>
<p>
<strong>EXPANSION</strong>. When assigning to indexed arrays, if the optional brackets
and subscript are supplied, that index is assigned to; otherwise the
index of the element assigned is the last index assigned to by the
statement plus one. Indexing starts at zero.</p>
<p>
When assigning to an associative array, the words in a compound
assignment may be either assignment statements, for which the subscript
is required, or a list of words that is interpreted as a sequence of
alternating keys and values: <em>name/=*( */key1 value1 key2 value2</em>
…*)*. These are treated identically to <em>name/=*(* [/key1/]=/value1</em>
[/key2/]=/value2/ …*)*. The first word in the list determines how the
remaining words are interpreted; all assignments in a list must be of
the same type. When using key/value pairs, the keys may not be missing
or empty; a final missing value is treated like the empty string.</p>
<p>
This syntax is also accepted by the <strong>declare</strong> builtin. Individual array
elements may be assigned to using the <em>name</em>[/subscript/]=/value/ syntax
introduced above. When assigning to an indexed array, if <em>name</em> is
subscripted by a negative number, that number is interpreted as relative
to one greater than the maximum index of <em>name</em>, so negative indices
count back from the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the
last element.</p>
<p>
The += operator will append to an array variable when assigning using
the compound assignment syntax; see</p>
<p>
<strong>PARAMETERS</strong> above.</p>
<p>
Any element of an array may be referenced using ${/name/[/subscript/]}.
The braces are required to avoid conflicts with pathname expansion. If
/subscript/ is *@* or ***, the word expands to all members of /name/.
These subscripts differ only when the word appears within double quotes.
If the word is double-quoted, ${<em>name</em>[*]} expands to a single word with
the value of each array member separated by the first character of the</p>
<p>
<strong>IFS</strong> special variable, and ${/name/[@]} expands each element of /name/
to a separate word. When there are no array members, ${<em>name</em>[@]}
expands to nothing. If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word,
the expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part
of the original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined
with the last part of the original word. This is analogous to the
expansion of the special parameters <strong>*</strong> and <strong>@</strong> (see <strong>Special
Parameters</strong> above). ${#/name/[/subscript/]} expands to the length of
${<em>name</em>[/subscript/]}. If <em>subscript</em> is <strong>*</strong> or <strong>@</strong>, the expansion is
the number of elements in the array. If the <em>subscript</em> used to
reference an element of an indexed array evaluates to a number less than
zero, it is interpreted as relative to one greater than the maximum
index of the array, so negative indices count back from the end of the
array, and an index of -1 references the last element.</p>
<p>
Referencing an array variable without a subscript is equivalent to
referencing the array with a subscript of 0. Any reference to a variable
using a valid subscript is legal, and <strong>bash</strong> will create an array if
necessary.</p>
<p>
An array variable is considered set if a subscript has been assigned a
value. The null string is a valid value.</p>
<p>
It is possible to obtain the keys (indices) of an array as well as the
values. ${*!*/name/[/@/]} and ${*!*/name/[/*/]} expand to the indices
assigned in array variable <em>name</em>. The treatment when in double quotes
is similar to the expansion of the special parameters <em>@</em> and <em>*</em> within
double quotes.</p>
<p>
The <strong>unset</strong> builtin is used to destroy arrays. <strong>unset</strong>
<em>name</em>[/subscript/] destroys the array element at index <em>subscript</em>, for
both indexed and associative arrays. Negative subscripts to indexed
arrays are interpreted as described above. Unsetting the last element of
an array variable does not unset the variable. <strong>unset</strong> <em>name</em>, where
<em>name</em> is an array, removes the entire array. <strong>unset</strong>
<em>name</em>[/subscript/], where <em>subscript</em> is <strong>*</strong> or <strong>@</strong>, behaves
differently depending on whether <em>name</em> is an indexed or associative
array. If <em>name</em> is an associative array, this unsets the element with
subscript <strong>*</strong> or <strong>@</strong>. If <em>name</em> is an indexed array, unset removes all
of the elements but does not remove the array itself.</p>
<p>
When using a variable name with a subscript as an argument to a command,
such as with <strong>unset</strong>, without using the word expansion syntax described
above, the argument is subject to pathname expansion. If pathname
expansion is not desired, the argument should be quoted.</p>
<p>
The <strong>declare</strong>, <strong>local</strong>, and <strong>readonly</strong> builtins each accept a <strong>-a</strong>
option to specify an indexed array and a <strong>-A</strong> option to specify an
associative array. If both options are supplied, <strong>-A</strong> takes precedence.
The <strong>read</strong> builtin accepts a <strong>-a</strong> option to assign a list of words read
from the standard input to an array. The <strong>set</strong> and <strong>declare</strong> builtins
display array values in a way that allows them to be reused as
assignments.</p>

EXPANSION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-24" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split into
words. There are seven kinds of expansion performed: <em>brace expansion</em>,
<em>tilde expansion</em>, <em>parameter and variable expansion</em>, <em>command
substitution</em>, <em>arithmetic expansion</em>, <em>word splitting</em>, and <em>pathname
expansion</em>.</p>
<p>
The order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter
and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command substitution
(done in a left-to-right fashion); word splitting; and pathname
expansion.</p>
<p>
On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion
available: <em>process substitution</em>. This is performed at the same time as
tilde, parameter, variable, and arithmetic expansion and command
substitution.</p>
<p>
After these expansions are performed, quote characters present in the
original word are removed unless they have been quoted themselves
(<em>quote removal</em>).</p>
<p>
Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can
increase the number of words of the expansion; other expansions expand a
single word to a single word. The only exceptions to this are the
expansions of &#34;<strong>$@</strong>&#34; and &#34;<strong>${*/name/</strong>[@]}*&#34;, and, in most cases, <strong>$*</strong>
and <strong>${*/name/</strong>[*]}* as explained above (see</p>
<p>

<h3 id="headline-25">
Brace Expansion
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-25" class="outline-text-3">
<p><em>Brace expansion</em> is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be
generated. This mechanism is similar to <em>pathname expansion</em>, but the
filenames generated need not exist. Patterns to be brace expanded take
the form of an optional <em>preamble</em>, followed by either a series of
comma-separated strings or a sequence expression between a pair of
braces, followed by an optional <em>postscript</em>. The preamble is prefixed
to each string contained within the braces, and the postscript is then
appended to each resulting string, expanding left to right.</p>
<p>
Brace expansions may be nested. The results of each expanded string are
not sorted; left to right order is preserved. For example, a*{<strong>d,c,b</strong>}*e
expands into `ade ace abe&#39;.</p>
<p>
A sequence expression takes the form <strong>{*/x/</strong>..*/y/*[..*/incr/*]}*, where
<em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are either integers or single letters, and <em>incr</em>, an
optional increment, is an integer. When integers are supplied, the
expression expands to each number between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, inclusive.
Supplied integers may be prefixed with <em>0</em> to force each term to have
the same width. When either <em>x</em> or <em>y</em> begins with a zero, the shell
attempts to force all generated terms to contain the same number of
digits, zero-padding where necessary. When letters are supplied, the
expression expands to each character lexicographically between <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em>, inclusive, using the default C locale. Note that both <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>
must be of the same type (integer or letter). When the increment is
supplied, it is used as the difference between each term. The default
increment is 1 or -1 as appropriate.</p>
<p>
Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any
characters special to other expansions are preserved in the result. It
is strictly textual. <strong>Bash</strong> does not apply any syntactic interpretation
to the context of the expansion or the text between the braces.</p>
<p>
A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening and
closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma or a valid sequence
expression. Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is left unchanged. A
<strong>{</strong> or <strong>,</strong> may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being
considered part of a brace expression. To avoid conflicts with parameter
expansion, the string <strong>${</strong> is not considered eligible for brace
expansion, and inhibits brace expansion until the closing <strong>}</strong>.</p>
<p>
This construct is typically used as shorthand when the common prefix of
the strings to be generated is longer than in the above example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Brace expansion introduces a slight incompatibility with historical
versions of <strong>sh</strong>. <strong>sh</strong> does not treat opening or closing braces
specially when they appear as part of a word, and preserves them in the
output. <strong>Bash</strong> removes braces from words as a consequence of brace
expansion. For example, a word entered to <strong>sh</strong> as <em>file{1,2}</em> appears
identically in the output. The same word is output as <em>file1 file2</em>
after expansion by <strong>bash</strong>. If strict compatibility with <strong>sh</strong> is desired,
start <strong>bash</strong> with the <strong>+B</strong> option or disable brace expansion with the
<strong>+B</strong> option to the <strong>set</strong> command (see</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below).</p>

Tilde Expansion
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-26" class="outline-text-3">
<p>If a word begins with an unquoted tilde character (`*~*&#39;), all of the
characters preceding the first unquoted slash (or all characters, if
there is no unquoted slash) are considered a <em>tilde-prefix</em>. If none of
the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the
tilde-prefix following the tilde are treated as a possible <em>login name</em>.
If this login name is the null string, the tilde is replaced with the
value of the shell parameter</p>
<p>
<strong>HOME</strong>. If</p>
<p>
<strong>HOME</strong> is unset, the home directory of the user executing the shell is
substituted instead. Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the
home directory associated with the specified login name.</p>
<p>
If the tilde-prefix is a `~+&#39;, the value of the shell variable</p>
<p>
<strong>PWD</strong> replaces the tilde-prefix. If the tilde-prefix is a `~-&#39;, the
value of the shell variable</p>
<p>
<strong>OLDPWD</strong>, if it is set, is substituted. If the characters following the
tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number <em>N</em>, optionally prefixed
by a `+&#39; or a `-&#39;, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the corresponding
element from the directory stack, as it would be displayed by the <strong>dirs</strong>
builtin invoked with the tilde-prefix as an argument. If the characters
following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number without a
leading `+&#39; or `-&#39;, `+&#39; is assumed.</p>
<p>
If the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the word is
unchanged.</p>
<p>
Each variable assignment is checked for unquoted tilde-prefixes
immediately following a <strong>:</strong> or the first <strong>=</strong>. In these cases, tilde
expansion is also performed. Consequently, one may use filenames with
tildes in assignments to</p>
<p>
<strong>PATH</strong>,</p>
<p>
<strong>MAILPATH</strong>, and</p>
<p>
<strong>CDPATH</strong>, and the shell assigns the expanded value.</p>
<p>
Bash also performs tilde expansion on words satisfying the conditions of
variable assignments (as described above under</p>
<p>
<strong>PARAMETERS</strong>) when they appear as arguments to simple commands. Bash
does not do this, except for the <em>declaration</em> commands listed above,
when in <em>posix mode</em>.</p>

substitution, or arithmetic expansion. The parameter name or symbol to
be expanded may be enclosed in braces, which are optional but serve to
protect the variable to be expanded from characters immediately
following it which could be interpreted as part of the name.</p>
<p>
When braces are used, the matching ending brace is the first `*}*&#39; not
escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string, and not within an
embedded arithmetic expansion, command substitution, or parameter
expansion.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
${<em>parameter</em>}
</dt>
<dd>The value of <em>parameter</em> is substituted. The braces
are required when <em>parameter</em> is a positional parameter with more than
one digit, or when <em>parameter</em> is followed by a character which is not
to be interpreted as part of its name. The <em>parameter</em> is a shell
parameter as described above <strong>PARAMETERS</strong>) or an array reference
(<strong>Arrays</strong>).</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the first character of <em>parameter</em> is an exclamation point (<strong>!</strong>), and
<em>parameter</em> is not a <em>nameref</em>, it introduces a level of indirection.
<strong>Bash</strong> uses the value formed by expanding the rest of <em>parameter</em> as the
new <em>parameter</em>; this is then expanded and that value is used in the
rest of the expansion, rather than the expansion of the original
<em>parameter</em>. This is known as <em>indirect expansion</em>. The value is subject
to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and
arithmetic expansion. If <em>parameter</em> is a nameref, this expands to the
name of the parameter referenced by <em>parameter</em> instead of performing
the complete indirect expansion. The exceptions to this are the
expansions of ${*!*/prefix/***} and ${*!*/name/[/@/]} described below.
The exclamation point must immediately follow the left brace in order to
introduce indirection.</p>
<p>
In each of the cases below, <em>word</em> is subject to tilde expansion,
parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.</p>
<p>
When not performing substring expansion, using the forms documented
below (e.g., <strong>:-</strong>), <strong>bash</strong> tests for a parameter that is unset or null.
Omitting the colon results in a test only for a parameter that is unset.</p>

<dd><strong>Assign Default Values</strong>. If <em>parameter</em> is

of <em>parameter</em> is substituted.</dd>

<p><strong>Substring Expansion</strong>. Expands to up to <em>length</em> characters of the value
of <em>parameter</em> starting at the character specified by <em>offset</em>. If
<em>parameter</em> is <strong>@</strong> or <strong>*</strong>, an indexed array subscripted by <strong>@</strong> or <strong>*</strong>,
or an associative array name, the results differ as described below. If
<em>length</em> is omitted, expands to the substring of the value of
<em>parameter</em> starting at the character specified by <em>offset</em> and
extending to the end of the value. <em>length</em> and <em>offset</em> are arithmetic
expressions (see</p>
<p>
<strong>ARITHMETIC EVALUATION</strong> below).</p>
<p>
If <em>offset</em> evaluates to a number less than zero, the value is used as
an offset in characters from the end of the value of <em>parameter</em>. If
<em>length</em> evaluates to a number less than zero, it is interpreted as an
offset in characters from the end of the value of <em>parameter</em> rather
than a number of characters, and the expansion is the characters between
<em>offset</em> and that result. Note that a negative offset must be separated
from the colon by at least one space to avoid being confused with the
<strong>:-</strong> expansion.</p>
<p>
If <em>parameter</em> is <strong>@</strong> or <strong>*</strong>, the result is <em>length</em> positional
parameters beginning at <em>offset</em>. A negative <em>offset</em> is taken relative
to one greater than the greatest positional parameter, so an offset of
-1 evaluates to the last positional parameter. It is an expansion error
if <em>length</em> evaluates to a number less than zero.</p>
<p>
If <em>parameter</em> is an indexed array name subscripted by @ or *, the
result is the <em>length</em> members of the array beginning with
${<em>parameter</em>[/offset/]}. A negative <em>offset</em> is taken relative to one
greater than the maximum index of the specified array. It is an
expansion error if <em>length</em> evaluates to a number less than zero.</p>
<p>
Substring expansion applied to an associative array produces undefined
results.</p>
<p>
Substring indexing is zero-based unless the positional parameters are
used, in which case the indexing starts at 1 by default. If <em>offset</em> is
0, and the positional parameters are used, <strong>$0</strong> is prefixed to the list.</p>

substituted is the number of elements in the array. If <em>parameter</em> is
an indexed array name subscripted by a negative number, that number is
interpreted as relative to one greater than the maximum index of
<em>parameter</em>, so negative indices count back from the end of the array,
and an index of -1 references the last element.</dd>

<p><strong>Pattern substitution</strong>. The <em>pattern</em> is expanded to produce a pattern
just as in pathname expansion. <em>Parameter</em> is expanded and the longest
match of <em>pattern</em> against its value is replaced with <em>string</em>. <em>string</em>
undergoes tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic
expansion, command and process substitution, and quote removal. The
match is performed using the rules described under <strong>Pattern Matching</strong>
below. In the first form above, only the first match is replaced. If
there are two slashes separating <em>parameter</em> and <em>pattern</em> (the second
form above), all matches of <em>pattern</em> are replaced with <em>string</em>. If
<em>pattern</em> is preceded by <strong>#</strong> (the third form above), it must match at
the beginning of the expanded value of <em>parameter</em>. If <em>pattern</em> is
preceded by <strong>%</strong> (the fourth form above), it must match at the end of the
expanded value of <em>parameter</em>. If the expansion of <em>string</em> is null,
matches of <em>pattern</em> are deleted. If <em>string</em> is null, matches of
<em>pattern</em> are deleted and the <strong>/</strong> following <em>pattern</em> may be omitted.</p>
<p>
If the <strong>patsub_replacement</strong> shell option is enabled using <strong>shopt</strong>, any
unquoted instances of <strong>&amp;</strong> in <em>string</em> are replaced with the matching
portion of <em>pattern</em>.</p>
<p>
Quoting any part of <em>string</em> inhibits replacement in the expansion of
the quoted portion, including replacement strings stored in shell
variables. Backslash will escape <strong>&amp;</strong> in <em>string</em>; the backslash is
removed in order to permit a literal <strong>&amp;</strong> in the replacement string.
Backslash can also be used to escape a backslash; <strong>\\</strong> results in a
literal backslash in the replacement. Users should take care if <em>string</em>
is double-quoted to avoid unwanted interactions between the backslash
and double-quoting, since backslash has special meaning within double
quotes. Pattern substitution performs the check for unquoted <strong>&amp;</strong> after
expanding <em>string</em>; shell programmers should quote any occurrences of
<strong>&amp;</strong> they want to be taken literally in the replacement and ensure any
instances of <strong>&amp;</strong> they want to be replaced are unquoted.</p>
<p>
If the <strong>nocasematch</strong> shell option is enabled, the match is performed
without regard to the case of alphabetic characters. If <em>parameter</em> is
<strong>@</strong> or <strong>*</strong>, the substitution operation is applied to each positional
parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list. If
<em>parameter</em> is an array variable subscripted with <strong>@</strong> or <strong>*</strong>, the
substitution operation is applied to each member of the array in turn,
and the expansion is the resultant list.</p>

<p><strong>Case modification</strong>. This expansion modifies the case of alphabetic
characters in <em>parameter</em>. The <em>pattern</em> is expanded to produce a
pattern just as in pathname expansion. Each character in the expanded
value of <em>parameter</em> is tested against <em>pattern</em>, and, if it matches the
pattern, its case is converted. The pattern should not attempt to match
more than one character. The <strong>^</strong> operator converts lowercase letters
matching <em>pattern</em> to uppercase; the <strong>,</strong> operator converts matching
uppercase letters to lowercase. The <strong>^^</strong> and <strong>,,</strong> expansions convert
each matched character in the expanded value; the <strong>^</strong> and <strong>,</strong> expansions
match and convert only the first character in the expanded value. If
<em>pattern</em> is omitted, it is treated like a <strong>?</strong>, which matches every
character. If <em>parameter</em> is <strong>@</strong> or <strong>*</strong>, the case modification operation
is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is
the resultant list. If <em>parameter</em> is an array variable subscripted with
<strong>@</strong> or <strong>*</strong>, the case modification operation is applied to each member of
the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.</p>

Command Substitution
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-28" class="outline-text-3">
<p><em>Command substitution</em> allows the output of a command to replace the
command name. There are two forms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>$(*/command/ *)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
or</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>`*/command/*`</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Bash</strong> performs the expansion by executing <em>command</em> in a subshell
environment and replacing the command substitution with the standard
output of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted. Embedded
newlines are not deleted, but they may be removed during word splitting.
The command substitution <strong>$(cat */file/</strong>)* can be replaced by the
equivalent but faster <strong>$(&lt; */file/</strong>)*.</p>
<p>
When the old-style backquote form of substitution is used, backslash
retains its literal meaning except when followed by <strong>$</strong>, <strong>`</strong>, or <strong>\</strong>.
The first backquote not preceded by a backslash terminates the command
substitution. When using the $( <em>command</em> ) form, all characters between
the parentheses make up the command; none are treated specially.</p>
<p>
Command substitutions may be nested. To nest when using the backquoted
form, escape the inner backquotes with backslashes.</p>
<p>
If the substitution appears within double quotes, word splitting and
pathname expansion are not performed on the results.</p>

Arithmetic Expansion
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-29" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Arithmetic expansion allows the evaluation of an arithmetic expression
and the substitution of the result. The format for arithmetic expansion
is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>$((*/expression/</strong>))*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <em>expression</em> undergoes the same expansions as if it were within
double quotes, but double quote characters in <em>expression</em> are not
treated specially and are removed. All tokens in the expression undergo
parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and quote
removal. The result is treated as the arithmetic expression to be
evaluated. Arithmetic expansions may be nested.</p>
<p>
The evaluation is performed according to the rules listed below under</p>
<p>
<strong>ARITHMETIC EVALUATION</strong>. If <em>expression</em> is invalid, <strong>bash</strong> prints a

Process Substitution
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-30" class="outline-text-3">
<p><em>Process substitution</em> allows a process&#39;s input or output to be referred
to using a filename. It takes the form of <strong>&lt;(*/list /</strong>)* or
<strong>&gt;(*/list /</strong>)*. The process <em>list</em> is run asynchronously, and its input
or output appears as a filename. This filename is passed as an argument
to the current command as the result of the expansion. If the
<strong>&gt;(*/list /</strong>)* form is used, writing to the file will provide input for
<em>list</em>. If the <strong>&lt;(*/list /</strong>)* form is used, the file passed as an
argument should be read to obtain the output of <em>list</em>. Process
substitution is supported on systems that support named pipes (<em>FIFOs</em>)
or the <strong>/dev/fd</strong> method of naming open files.</p>
<p>
When available, process substitution is performed simultaneously with

Word Splitting

<div id="outline-text-headline-31" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The shell scans the results of parameter expansion, command
substitution, and arithmetic expansion that did not occur within double
quotes for <em>word splitting</em>.</p>
<p>
The shell treats each character of</p>
<p>
<strong>IFS</strong> as a delimiter, and splits the results of the other expansions
into words using these characters as field terminators. If</p>
<p>
<strong>IFS</strong> is unset, or its value is exactly <strong>&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;</strong>, the
default, then sequences of <strong>&lt;space&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;tab&gt;</strong>, and <strong>&lt;newline&gt;</strong> at the
beginning and end of the results of the previous expansions are ignored,
and any sequence of</p>
<p>
<strong>IFS</strong> characters not at the beginning or end serves to delimit words. If</p>
<p>
<strong>IFS</strong> has a value other than the default, then sequences of the
whitespace characters <strong>space</strong>, <strong>tab</strong>, and <strong>newline</strong> are ignored at the
beginning and end of the word, as long as the whitespace character is in
the value of</p>
<p>
<strong>IFS</strong> (an</p>
<p>
<strong>IFS</strong> whitespace character). Any character in</p>
<p>
<strong>IFS</strong> that is not</p>
<p>
<strong>IFS</strong> whitespace, along with any adjacent</p>
<p>
<strong>IFS</strong> whitespace characters, delimits a field. A sequence of</p>
<p>
<strong>IFS</strong> whitespace characters is also treated as a delimiter. If the value
of</p>
<p>
<strong>IFS</strong> is null, no word splitting occurs.</p>
<p>
Explicit null arguments ( &#34; &#34; or  &#39; &#39; ) are retained and passed to
commands as empty strings. Unquoted implicit null arguments, resulting
from the expansion of parameters that have no values, are removed. If a
parameter with no value is expanded within double quotes, a null
argument results and is retained and passed to a command as an empty
string. When a quoted null argument appears as part of a word whose
expansion is non-null, the null argument is removed. That is, the word
<code class="verbatim">-d&#39; &#39;</code> becomes <code class="verbatim">-d</code> after word splitting and null argument removal.</p>

Pathname Expansion
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-32" class="outline-text-3">
<p>After word splitting, unless the <strong>-f</strong> option has been set, <strong>bash</strong> scans
each word for the characters <strong>*</strong>, <strong>?</strong>, and <strong>[</strong>. If one of these
characters appears, and is not quoted, then the word is regarded as a
<em>pattern</em>, and replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of filenames
matching the pattern (see</p>
<p>
<strong>Pattern Matching</strong> below). If no matching filenames are found, and the
shell option <strong>nullglob</strong> is not enabled, the word is left unchanged. If
the <strong>nullglob</strong> option is set, and no matches are found, the word is
removed. If the <strong>failglob</strong> shell option is set, and no matches are
found, an error message is printed and the command is not executed. If
the shell option <strong>nocaseglob</strong> is enabled, the match is performed without
regard to the case of alphabetic characters. When a pattern is used for
pathname expansion, the character <strong>``.&#39;&#39;</strong> at the start of a name or
immediately following a slash must be matched explicitly, unless the
shell option <strong>dotglob</strong> is set. In order to match the filenames <strong>``.&#39;&#39;</strong>
and <strong>``..&#39;&#39;</strong>, the pattern must begin with ``.&#39;&#39; (for example, ``.?&#39;&#39;),
even if <strong>dotglob</strong> is set. If the <strong>globskipdots</strong> shell option is enabled,
the filenames <strong>``.&#39;&#39;</strong> and <strong>``..&#39;&#39;</strong> are never matched, even if the
pattern begins with a <strong>``.&#39;&#39;</strong>. When not matching pathnames, the <strong>``.&#39;&#39;</strong>
character is not treated specially. When matching a pathname, the slash
character must always be matched explicitly by a slash in the pattern,
but in other matching contexts it can be matched by a special pattern
character as described below under</p>
<p>
<strong>Pattern Matching</strong>. See the description of <strong>shopt</strong> below under</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> for a description of the <strong>nocaseglob</strong>,
<strong>nullglob</strong>, <strong>globskipdots</strong>, <strong>failglob</strong>, and <strong>dotglob</strong> shell options.</p>
<p>
The</p>
<p>
<strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong> shell variable may be used to restrict the set of file
names matching a <em>pattern</em>. If</p>
<p>
<strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong> is set, each matching file name that also matches one of
the patterns in</p>
<p>
<strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong> is removed from the list of matches. If the <strong>nocaseglob</strong>
option is set, the matching against the patterns in</p>
<p>
<strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong> is performed without regard to case. The filenames <strong>``.&#39;&#39;</strong>
and <strong>``..&#39;&#39;</strong> are always ignored when</p>
<p>
<strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong> is set and not null. However, setting</p>
<p>
<strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong> to a non-null value has the effect of enabling the
<strong>dotglob</strong> shell option, so all other filenames beginning with a <strong>``.&#39;&#39;</strong>
will match. To get the old behavior of ignoring filenames beginning with
a <strong>``.&#39;&#39;</strong>, make <strong>``.</strong>&#39;&#39;* one of the patterns in</p>
<p>
<strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong>. The <strong>dotglob</strong> option is disabled when</p>
<p>
<strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong> is unset. The pattern matching honors the setting of the
<strong>extglob</strong> shell option.</p>
<p>
<strong>Pattern Matching</strong></p>
<p>
Any character that appears in a pattern, other than the special pattern
characters described below, matches itself. The NUL character may not
occur in a pattern. A backslash escapes the following character; the
escaping backslash is discarded when matching. The special pattern
characters must be quoted if they are to be matched literally.</p>
<p>
The special pattern characters have the following meanings:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>*</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Matches any string, including the null string. When the
<strong>globstar</strong> shell option is enabled, and <strong>*</strong> is used in a pathname
expansion context, two adjacent ***s used as a single pattern will
match all files and zero or more directories and subdirectories. If
followed by a <strong>/</strong>, two adjacent ***s will match only directories and
subdirectories.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>?</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Matches any single character.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>[…]</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Matches any one of the enclosed characters. A pair of
characters separated by a hyphen denotes a <em>range expression</em>; any
character that falls between those two characters, inclusive, using
the current locale&#39;s collating sequence and character set, is matched.
If the first character following the <strong>[</strong> is a <strong>!</strong> or a <strong>^</strong> then any
character not enclosed is matched. The sorting order of characters in
range expressions, and the characters included in the range, are
determined by the current locale and the values of the</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>LC_COLLATE</strong> or</p>
<p>
<strong>LC_ALL</strong> shell variables, if set. To obtain the traditional
interpretation of range expressions, where <strong>[a-d]</strong> is equivalent to
<strong>[abcd]</strong>, set value of the <strong>LC_ALL</strong> shell variable to <strong>C</strong>, or enable the
<strong>globasciiranges</strong> shell option. A <strong>-</strong> may be matched by including it as
the first or last character in the set. A <strong>]</strong> may be matched by
including it as the first character in the set.\\</p>
<p>
Within <strong>[</strong> and <strong>]</strong>, <em>character classes</em> can be specified using the
syntax <strong>[:*/class/</strong>:]*, where <em>class</em> is one of the following classes
defined in the POSIX standard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>alnum alpha ascii blank cntrl digit graph lower print punct space upper
word xdigit</strong><br>
A character class matches any character belonging to that class. The

If the <strong>extglob</strong> shell option is enabled using the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin, the
shell recognizes several extended pattern matching operators. In the
following description, a <em>pattern-list</em> is a list of one or more
patterns separated by a <strong>|</strong>. Composite patterns may be formed using one
or more of the following sub-patterns:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>?(</strong> /pattern-list /*)*
</dt>
<dd>Matches zero or one occurrence of the given
patterns</dd>
<dt>
<strong>*(</strong> /pattern-list /*)*
</dt>
<dd>Matches zero or more occurrences of the
given patterns</dd>
<dt>
<strong>+(</strong> /pattern-list /*)*
</dt>
<dd>Matches one or more occurrences of the
given patterns</dd>
<dt>
<strong>@(</strong> /pattern-list /*)*
</dt>
<dd>Matches one of the given patterns</dd>
<dt>
<strong>!(</strong> /pattern-list /*)*
</dt>
<dd>Matches anything except one of the given
patterns</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
The*extglob* option changes the behavior of the parser, since the
parentheses are normally treated as operators with syntactic meaning. To
ensure that extended matching patterns are parsed correctly, make sure
that <strong>extglob</strong> is enabled before parsing constructs containing the
patterns, including shell functions and command substitutions.</p>
<p>
When matching filenames, the <strong>dotglob</strong> shell option determines the set
of filenames that are tested: when <strong>dotglob</strong> is enabled, the set of
filenames includes all files beginning with ``.&#39;&#39;, but ``.&#39;&#39; and ``..&#39;&#39;
must be matched by a pattern or sub-pattern that begins with a dot; when
it is disabled, the set does not include any filenames beginning with
``.&#39;&#39; unless the pattern or sub-pattern begins with a ``.&#39;&#39;. As above,
``.&#39;&#39; only has a special meaning when matching filenames.</p>
<p>
Complicated extended pattern matching against long strings is slow,
especially when the patterns contain alternations and the strings
contain multiple matches. Using separate matches against shorter
strings, or using arrays of strings instead of a single long string, may
be faster.</p>

REDIRECTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-34" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Before a command is executed, its input and output may be <em>redirected</em>
using a special notation interpreted by the shell. <em>Redirection</em> allows
commands&#39; file handles to be duplicated, opened, closed, made to refer
to different files, and can change the files the command reads from and
writes to. Redirection may also be used to modify file handles in the
current shell execution environment. The following redirection operators
may precede or appear anywhere within a <em>simple command</em> or may follow a
<em>command</em>. Redirections are processed in the order they appear, from
left to right.</p>
<p>
Each redirection that may be preceded by a file descriptor number may
instead be preceded by a word of the form {<em>varname</em>}. In this case, for
each redirection operator except &gt;&amp;- and &lt;&amp;-, the shell will allocate a
file descriptor greater than or equal to 10 and assign it to <em>varname</em>.
If &gt;&amp;- or &lt;&amp;- is preceded by {<em>varname</em>}, the value of <em>varname</em> defines
the file descriptor to close. If {<em>varname</em>} is supplied, the
redirection persists beyond the scope of the command, allowing the shell
programmer to manage the file descriptor&#39;s lifetime manually. The
<strong>varredir_close</strong> shell option manages this behavior.</p>
<p>
In the following descriptions, if the file descriptor number is omitted,
and the first character of the redirection operator is <strong>&lt;</strong>, the
redirection refers to the standard input (file descriptor 0). If the
first character of the redirection operator is <strong>&gt;</strong>, the redirection
refers to the standard output (file descriptor 1).</p>
<p>
The word following the redirection operator in the following
descriptions, unless otherwise noted, is subjected to brace expansion,
tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution,
arithmetic expansion, quote removal, pathname expansion, and word
splitting. If it expands to more than one word, <strong>bash</strong> reports an error.</p>
<p>
Note that the order of redirections is significant. For example, the
command</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ls <strong>&gt;</strong> dirlist 2*&gt;&amp;*1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
directs both standard output and standard error to the file <em>dirlist</em>,
while the command</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ls 2*&gt;&amp;*1 <strong>&gt;</strong> dirlist</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
directs only the standard output to file <em>dirlist</em>, because the standard
error was duplicated from the standard output before the standard output
was redirected to <em>dirlist</em>.</p>
<p>
<strong>Bash</strong> handles several filenames specially when they are used in
redirections, as described in the following table. If the operating
system on which <strong>bash</strong> is running provides these special files, bash
will use them; otherwise it will emulate them internally with the
behavior described below.</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong><em>dev/fd//fd</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>If <em>fd</em> is a valid integer, file descriptor <em>fd</em> is
duplicated.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>/dev/stdin</strong>
</dt>
<dd>File descriptor 0 is duplicated.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>/dev/stdout</strong>
</dt>
<dd>File descriptor 1 is duplicated.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>/dev/stderr</strong>
</dt>
<dd>File descriptor 2 is duplicated.</dd>
<dt>
<strong><em>dev/tcp//host///port</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>If <em>host</em> is a valid hostname or Internet
address, and <em>port</em> is an integer port number or service name, <strong>bash</strong>
attempts to open the corresponding TCP socket.</dd>
<dt>
<strong><em>dev/udp//host///port</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>If <em>host</em> is a valid hostname or Internet
address, and <em>port</em> is an integer port number or service name, <strong>bash</strong>
attempts to open the corresponding UDP socket.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
A failure to open or create a file causes the redirection to fail.</p>
<p>
Redirections using file descriptors greater than 9 should be used with
care, as they may conflict with file descriptors the shell uses
internally.</p>

Here Documents

<div id="outline-text-headline-40" class="outline-text-3">
<p>This type of redirection instructs the shell to read input from the
current source until a line containing only <em>delimiter</em> (with no
trailing blanks) is seen. All of the lines read up to that point are
then used as the standard input (or file descriptor <em>n</em> if <em>n</em> is
specified) for a command.</p>

The format of here-documents is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
[n]&lt;&lt;[-]word
        here-document

<p>
No parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic
expansion, or pathname expansion is performed on <em>word</em>. If any part of
<em>word</em> is quoted, the <em>delimiter</em> is the result of quote removal on
<em>word</em>, and the lines in the here-document are not expanded. If <em>word</em>
is unquoted, all lines of the here-document are subjected to parameter
expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion, the character
sequence <strong>\&lt;newline&gt;</strong> is ignored, and <strong>\</strong> must be used to quote the
characters <strong>\</strong>, <strong>$</strong>, and <strong>`</strong>.</p>
<p>
If the redirection operator is <strong>&lt;&lt;-</strong>, then all leading tab characters
are stripped from input lines and the line containing <em>delimiter</em>. This

ALIASES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-45" class="outline-text-2">
<p><em>Aliases</em> allow a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as
the first word of a simple command. The shell maintains a list of
aliases that may be set and unset with the <strong>alias</strong> and <strong>unalias</strong> builtin
commands (see</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below). The first word of each simple command,
if unquoted, is checked to see if it has an alias. If so, that word is
replaced by the text of the alias. The characters <strong>/</strong>, <strong>$</strong>, <strong>`</strong>, and <strong>=</strong>
and any of the shell <em>metacharacters</em> or quoting characters listed above
may not appear in an alias name. The replacement text may contain any
valid shell input, including shell metacharacters. The first word of the
replacement text is tested for aliases, but a word that is identical to
an alias being expanded is not expanded a second time. This means that
one may alias <strong>ls</strong> to <strong>ls -F</strong>, for instance, and <strong>bash</strong> does not try to
recursively expand the replacement text. If the last character of the
alias value is a <em>blank</em>, then the next command word following the alias
is also checked for alias expansion.</p>
<p>
Aliases are created and listed with the <strong>alias</strong> command, and removed
with the <strong>unalias</strong> command.</p>
<p>
There is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text. If
arguments are needed, use a shell function (see</p>
<p>
<strong>FUNCTIONS</strong> below).</p>
<p>
Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless the
<strong>expand_aliases</strong> shell option is set using <strong>shopt</strong> (see the description
of <strong>shopt</strong> under</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below).</p>
<p>
The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are somewhat
confusing. <strong>Bash</strong> always reads at least one complete line of input, and
all lines that make up a compound command, before executing any of the
commands on that line or the compound command. Aliases are expanded when
a command is read, not when it is executed. Therefore, an alias
definition appearing on the same line as another command does not take
effect until the next line of input is read. The commands following the
alias definition on that line are not affected by the new alias. This
behavior is also an issue when functions are executed. Aliases are
expanded when a function definition is read, not when the function is
executed, because a function definition is itself a command. As a
consequence, aliases defined in a function are not available until after
that function is executed. To be safe, always put alias definitions on a
separate line, and do not use <strong>alias</strong> in compound commands.</p>
<p>
For almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by shell functions.</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-46" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-46">
FUNCTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-46" class="outline-text-2">
<p>A shell function, defined as described above under</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL GRAMMAR</strong>, stores a series of commands for later execution. When
the name of a shell function is used as a simple command name, the list
of commands associated with that function name is executed. Functions
are executed in the context of the current shell; no new process is
created to interpret them (contrast this with the execution of a shell
script). When a function is executed, the arguments to the function
become the positional parameters during its execution. The special
parameter <strong>#</strong> is updated to reflect the change. Special parameter <strong>0</strong> is
unchanged. The first element of the</p>
<p>
<strong>FUNCNAME</strong> variable is set to the name of the function while the
function is executing.</p>
<p>
All other aspects of the shell execution environment are identical
between a function and its caller with these exceptions: the</p>
<p>
<strong>DEBUG</strong> and <strong>RETURN</strong> traps (see the description of the <strong>trap</strong> builtin
under</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below) are not inherited unless the function
has been given the <strong>trace</strong> attribute (see the description of the</p>
<p>
<strong>declare</strong> builtin below) or the <strong>-o functrace</strong> shell option has been
enabled with the <strong>set</strong> builtin (in which case all functions inherit the
<strong>DEBUG</strong> and <strong>RETURN</strong> traps), and the</p>
<p>
<strong>ERR</strong> trap is not inherited unless the <strong>-o errtrace</strong> shell option has
been enabled.</p>
<p>
Variables local to the function may be declared with the <strong>local</strong> builtin
command (<em>local variables</em>). Ordinarily, variables and their values are
shared between the function and its caller. If a variable is declared
<strong>local</strong>, the variable&#39;s visible scope is restricted to that function and
its children (including the functions it calls).</p>
<p>
In the following description, the <em>current scope</em> is a currently-
executing function. Previous scopes consist of that function&#39;s caller
and so on, back to the &#34;global&#34; scope, where the shell is not executing
any shell function. Consequently, a local variable at the current scope
is a variable declared using the <strong>local</strong> or <strong>declare</strong> builtins in the
function that is currently executing.</p>
<p>
Local variables &#34;shadow&#34; variables with the same name declared at
previous scopes. For instance, a local variable declared in a function
hides a global variable of the same name: references and assignments
refer to the local variable, leaving the global variable unmodified.
When the function returns, the global variable is once again visible.</p>
<p>
The shell uses <em>dynamic scoping</em> to control a variable&#39;s visibility
within functions. With dynamic scoping, visible variables and their
values are a result of the sequence of function calls that caused
execution to reach the current function. The value of a variable that a
function sees depends on its value within its caller, if any, whether
that caller is the &#34;global&#34; scope or another shell function. This is
also the value that a local variable declaration &#34;shadows&#34;, and the
value that is restored when the function returns.</p>
<p>
For example, if a variable <em>var</em> is declared as local in function
<em>func1</em>, and <em>func1</em> calls another function <em>func2</em>, references to <em>var</em>
made from within <em>func2</em> will resolve to the local variable <em>var</em> from
<em>func1</em>, shadowing any global variable named <em>var</em>.</p>
<p>
The <strong>unset</strong> builtin also acts using the same dynamic scope: if a
variable is local to the current scope, <strong>unset</strong> will unset it; otherwise
the unset will refer to the variable found in any calling scope as
described above. If a variable at the current local scope is unset, it
will remain so (appearing as unset) until it is reset in that scope or
until the function returns. Once the function returns, any instance of
the variable at a previous scope will become visible. If the unset acts
on a variable at a previous scope, any instance of a variable with that
name that had been shadowed will become visible (see below how the
<strong>localvar_unset</strong> shell option changes this behavior).</p>
<p>
The <strong>FUNCNEST</strong> variable, if set to a numeric value greater than 0,
defines a maximum function nesting level. Function invocations that
exceed the limit cause the entire command to abort.</p>
<p>
If the builtin command <strong>return</strong> is executed in a function, the function
completes and execution resumes with the next command after the function
call. Any command associated with the <strong>RETURN</strong> trap is executed before
execution resumes. When a function completes, the values of the
positional parameters and the special parameter <strong>#</strong> are restored to the
values they had prior to the function&#39;s execution.</p>
<p>
Function names and definitions may be listed with the <strong>-f</strong> option to the
<strong>declare</strong> or <strong>typeset</strong> builtin commands. The <strong>-F</strong> option to <strong>declare</strong> or
<strong>typeset</strong> will list the function names only (and optionally the source
file and line number, if the <strong>extdebug</strong> shell option is enabled).
Functions may be exported so that child shell processes (those created
when executing a separate shell invocation) automatically have them
defined with the <strong>-f</strong> option to the <strong>export</strong> builtin. A function
definition may be deleted using the <strong>-f</strong> option to the <strong>unset</strong> builtin.</p>
<p>
Functions may be recursive. The <strong>FUNCNEST</strong> variable may be used to limit
the depth of the function call stack and restrict the number of function
invocations. By default, no limit is imposed on the number of recursive
calls.</p>

<p>Shell variables are allowed as operands; parameter expansion is
performed before the expression is evaluated. Within an expression,
shell variables may also be referenced by name without using the
parameter expansion syntax. A shell variable that is null or unset
evaluates to 0 when referenced by name without using the parameter
expansion syntax. The value of a variable is evaluated as an arithmetic
expression when it is referenced, or when a variable which has been
given the <em>integer</em> attribute using <strong>declare -i</strong> is assigned a value. A
null value evaluates to 0. A shell variable need not have its <em>integer</em>
attribute turned on to be used in an expression.</p>
<p>
Integer constants follow the C language definition, without suffixes or
character constants. Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted as octal
numbers. A leading 0x or 0X denotes hexadecimal. Otherwise, numbers take
the form [/base#/]n, where the optional <em>base</em> is a decimal number
between 2 and 64 representing the arithmetic base, and <em>n</em> is a number
in that base. If <em>base#</em> is omitted, then base 10 is used. When
specifying <em>n</em>, if a non-digit is required, the digits greater than 9
are represented by the lowercase letters, the uppercase letters, @, and
_, in that order. If <em>base</em> is less than or equal to 36, lowercase and
uppercase letters may be used interchangeably to represent numbers
between 10 and 35.</p>

Operators are evaluated in order of precedence. Sub-expressions in
parentheses are evaluated first and may override the precedence rules

CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-48" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Conditional expressions are used by the <strong>[[</strong> compound command and the
<strong>test</strong> and <strong>[</strong> builtin commands to test file attributes and perform
string and arithmetic comparisons. The <strong>test</strong> and <strong>[</strong> commands determine
their behavior based on the number of arguments; see the descriptions of
those commands for any other command-specific actions.</p>
<p>
Expressions are formed from the following unary or binary primaries.
<strong>Bash</strong> handles several filenames specially when they are used in
expressions. If the operating system on which <strong>bash</strong> is running provides
these special files, bash will use them; otherwise it will emulate them
internally with this behavior: If any <em>file</em> argument to one of the
primaries is of the form <em>/dev/fd/n</em>, then file descriptor <em>n</em> is
checked. If the <em>file</em> argument to one of the primaries is one of
<em>/dev/stdin</em>, <em>/dev/stdout</em>, or <em>/dev/stderr</em>, file descriptor 0, 1, or
2, respectively, is checked.</p>
<p>
Unless otherwise specified, primaries that operate on files follow
symbolic links and operate on the target of the link, rather than the
link itself.</p>
<p>
When used with <strong>[[</strong>, the <strong>&lt;</strong> and <strong>&gt;</strong> operators sort lexicographically
using the current locale. The <strong>test</strong> command sorts using ASCII ordering.</p>

SIMPLE COMMAND EXPANSION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-49" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When a simple command is executed, the shell performs the following
expansions, assignments, and redirections, from left to right, in the
following order.</p>
<ol>
<li>The words that the parser has marked as variable assignments (those
preceding the command name) and redirections are saved for later
processing.</li>
<li>The words that are not variable assignments or redirections are
expanded. If any words remain after expansion, the first word is
taken to be the name of the command and the remaining words are the
arguments.</li>
<li>Redirections are performed as described above under</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>REDIRECTION</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li value="4">The text after the <strong>=</strong> in each variable assignment undergoes
tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution,
arithmetic expansion, and quote removal before being assigned to the
variable.</li>
</ol>
<p>If no command name results, the variable assignments affect the current
shell environment. In the case of such a command (one that consists only
of assignment statements and redirections), assignment statements are
performed before redirections. Otherwise, the variables are added to the
environment of the executed command and do not affect the current shell
environment. If any of the assignments attempts to assign a value to a
readonly variable, an error occurs, and the command exits with a
non-zero status.</p>
<p>
If no command name results, redirections are performed, but do not
affect the current shell environment. A redirection error causes the
command to exit with a non-zero status.</p>
<p>
If there is a command name left after expansion, execution proceeds as
described below. Otherwise, the command exits. If one of the expansions
contained a command substitution, the exit status of the command is the
exit status of the last command substitution performed. If there were no
command substitutions, the command exits with a status of zero.</p>

<h2 id="headline-50">
COMMAND EXECUTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-50" class="outline-text-2">
<p>After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple
command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are
taken.</p>
<p>
If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate
it. If there exists a shell function by that name, that function is
invoked as described above in</p>
<p>
<strong>FUNCTIONS</strong>. If the name does not match a function, the shell searches
for it in the list of shell builtins. If a match is found, that builtin
is invoked.</p>
<p>
If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no
slashes, <strong>bash</strong> searches each element of the</p>
<p>
<strong>PATH</strong> for a directory containing an executable file by that name.
<strong>Bash</strong> uses a hash table to remember the full pathnames of executable
files (see <strong>hash</strong> under</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below). A full search of the directories in</p>
<p>
<strong>PATH</strong> is performed only if the command is not found in the hash table.
If the search is unsuccessful, the shell searches for a defined shell
function named <strong>command_not_found_handle</strong>. If that function exists, it
is invoked in a separate execution environment with the original command
and the original command&#39;s arguments as its arguments, and the
function&#39;s exit status becomes the exit status of that subshell. If that
function is not defined, the shell prints an error message and returns
an exit status of 127.</p>
<p>
If the search is successful, or if the command name contains one or more
slashes, the shell executes the named program in a separate execution
environment. Argument 0 is set to the name given, and the remaining
arguments to the command are set to the arguments given, if any.</p>
<p>
If this execution fails because the file is not in executable format,
and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a <em>shell script</em>, a
file containing shell commands, and the shell creates a new instance of
itself to execute it. This subshell reinitializes itself, so that the
effect is as if a new shell had been invoked to handle the script, with
the exception that the locations of commands remembered by the parent
(see <strong>hash</strong> below under</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong>) are retained by the child.</p>
<p>
If the program is a file beginning with <strong>#!</strong>, the remainder of the first
line specifies an interpreter for the program. The shell executes the
specified interpreter on operating systems that do not handle this
executable format themselves. The arguments to the interpreter consist
of a single optional argument following the interpreter name on the
first line of the program, followed by the name of the program, followed
by the command arguments, if any.</p>

<h2 id="headline-51">
COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-51" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The shell has an <em>execution environment</em>, which consists of the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>open files inherited by the shell at invocation, as modified by
redirections supplied to the <strong>exec</strong> builtin</li>
<li>the current working directory as set by <strong>cd</strong>, <strong>pushd</strong>, or <strong>popd</strong>, or
inherited by the shell at invocation</li>
<li>the file creation mode mask as set by <strong>umask</strong> or inherited from the
shell&#39;s parent</li>
<li>current traps set by <strong>trap</strong></li>
<li>shell parameters that are set by variable assignment or with <strong>set</strong> or
inherited from the shell&#39;s parent in the environment</li>
<li>shell functions defined during execution or inherited from the shell&#39;s
parent in the environment</li>
<li>options enabled at invocation (either by default or with command-line
arguments) or by <strong>set</strong></li>
<li>options enabled by <strong>shopt</strong></li>
<li>shell aliases defined with <strong>alias</strong></li>
<li>various process IDs, including those of background jobs, the value of
<strong>$$</strong>, and the value of</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PPID</strong></p>
<p>
When a simple command other than a builtin or shell function is to be
executed, it is invoked in a separate execution environment that
consists of the following. Unless otherwise noted, the values are
inherited from the shell.</p>
<ul>
<li>the shell&#39;s open files, plus any modifications and additions specified
by redirections to the command</li>
<li>the current working directory</li>
<li>the file creation mode mask</li>
<li>shell variables and functions marked for export, along with variables
exported for the command, passed in the environment</li>
<li>traps caught by the shell are reset to the values inherited from the
shell&#39;s parent, and traps ignored by the shell are ignored</li>
</ul>
<p>A command invoked in this separate environment cannot affect the shell&#39;s
execution environment.</p>
<p>
A <em>subshell</em> is a copy of the shell process.</p>
<p>
Command substitution, commands grouped with parentheses, and
asynchronous commands are invoked in a subshell environment that is a
duplicate of the shell environment, except that traps caught by the
shell are reset to the values that the shell inherited from its parent
at invocation. Builtin commands that are invoked as part of a pipeline
are also executed in a subshell environment. Changes made to the
subshell environment cannot affect the shell&#39;s execution environment.</p>
<p>
Subshells spawned to execute command substitutions inherit the value of
the <strong>-e</strong> option from the parent shell. When not in <em>posix mode</em>, <strong>bash</strong>
clears the <strong>-e</strong> option in such subshells.</p>
<p>
If a command is followed by a <strong>&amp;</strong> and job control is not active, the
default standard input for the command is the empty file <em>/dev/null</em>.
Otherwise, the invoked command inherits the file descriptors of the
calling shell as modified by redirections.</p>

<h2 id="headline-52">
ENVIRONMENT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-52" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the
<em>environment</em>. This is a list of <em>name</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, of the form
<em>name=value</em>.</p>
<p>
The shell provides several ways to manipulate the environment. On
invocation, the shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter
for each name found, automatically marking it for <em>export</em> to child
processes. Executed commands inherit the environment. The <strong>export</strong> and
<strong>declare -x</strong> commands allow parameters and functions to be added to and
deleted from the environment. If the value of a parameter in the
environment is modified, the new value becomes part of the environment,
replacing the old. The environment inherited by any executed command
consists of the shell&#39;s initial environment, whose values may be
modified in the shell, less any pairs removed by the <strong>unset</strong> command,
plus any additions via the <strong>export</strong> and <strong>declare -x</strong> commands.</p>
<p>
The environment for any <em>simple command</em> or function may be augmented
temporarily by prefixing it with parameter assignments, as described
above in</p>
<p>
<strong>PARAMETERS</strong>. These assignment statements affect only the environment
seen by that command.</p>
<p>
If the <strong>-k</strong> option is set (see the <strong>set</strong> builtin command below), then
<em>all</em> parameter assignments are placed in the environment for a command,
not just those that precede the command name.</p>
<p>
When <strong>bash</strong> invokes an external command, the variable <strong>_</strong> is set to the
full filename of the command and passed to that command in its
environment.</p>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-53" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-53">
EXIT STATUS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-53" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The exit status of an executed command is the value returned by the
<em>waitpid</em> system call or equivalent function. Exit statuses fall between
0 and 255, though, as explained below, the shell may use values above
125 specially. Exit statuses from shell builtins and compound commands
are also limited to this range. Under certain circumstances, the shell
will use special values to indicate specific failure modes.</p>
<p>
For the shell&#39;s purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status
has succeeded. An exit status of zero indicates success. A non-zero exit
status indicates failure. When a command terminates on a fatal signal
<em>N</em>, <strong>bash</strong> uses the value of 128+/N/ as the exit status.</p>
<p>
If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it
returns a status of 127. If a command is found but is not executable,
the return status is 126.</p>
<p>
If a command fails because of an error during expansion or redirection,
the exit status is greater than zero.</p>
<p>
Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 (<em>true</em>) if successful, and
non-zero (<em>false</em>) if an error occurs while they execute. All builtins
return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect usage, generally
invalid options or missing arguments.</p>
<p>
The exit status of the last command is available in the special
parameter $?.</p>
<p>
<strong>Bash</strong> itself returns the exit status of the last command executed,
unless a syntax error occurs, in which case it exits with a non-zero
value. See also the <strong>exit</strong> builtin command below.</p>

<h2 id="headline-54">
SIGNALS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-54" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When <strong>bash</strong> is interactive, in the absence of any traps, it ignores</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGTERM</strong> (so that <strong>kill 0</strong> does not kill an interactive shell), and</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGINT</strong> is caught and handled (so that the <strong>wait</strong> builtin is
interruptible). In all cases, <strong>bash</strong> ignores</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGQUIT</strong>. If job control is in effect, <strong>bash</strong> ignores</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGTTIN</strong>,</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGTTOU</strong>, and</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGTSTP</strong>.</p>
<p>
Non-builtin commands run by <strong>bash</strong> have signal handlers set to the
values inherited by the shell from its parent. When job control is not
in effect, asynchronous commands ignore</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGINT</strong> and</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGQUIT</strong> in addition to these inherited handlers. Commands run as a
result of command substitution ignore the keyboard-generated job control
signals</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGTTIN</strong>,</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGTTOU</strong>, and</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGTSTP</strong>.</p>
<p>
The shell exits by default upon receipt of a</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGHUP</strong>. Before exiting, an interactive shell resends the</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGHUP</strong> to all jobs, running or stopped. Stopped jobs are sent</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGCONT</strong> to ensure that they receive the</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGHUP</strong>. To prevent the shell from sending the signal to a particular
job, it should be removed from the jobs table with the <strong>disown</strong> builtin
(see</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below) or marked to not receive</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGHUP</strong> using <strong>disown -h</strong>.</p>
<p>
If the <strong>huponexit</strong> shell option has been set with <strong>shopt</strong>, <strong>bash</strong> sends
a</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGHUP</strong> to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.</p>
<p>
If <strong>bash</strong> is waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal for
which a trap has been set, the trap will not be executed until the
command completes. When <strong>bash</strong> is waiting for an asynchronous command
via the <strong>wait</strong> builtin, the reception of a signal for which a trap has
been set will cause the <strong>wait</strong> builtin to return immediately with an
exit status greater than 128, immediately after which the trap is
executed.</p>
<p>
When job control is not enabled, and <strong>bash</strong> is waiting for a foreground
command to complete, the shell receives keyboard-generated signals such
as</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGINT</strong> (usually generated by <strong>^C</strong>) that users commonly intend to send
to that command. This happens because the shell and the command are in
the same process group as the terminal, and <strong>^C</strong> sends</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGINT</strong> to all processes in that process group.</p>
<p>
When <strong>bash</strong> is running without job control enabled and receives</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGINT</strong> while waiting for a foreground command, it waits until that
foreground command terminates and then decides what to do about the</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGINT</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the command terminates due to the</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>SIGINT</strong>, <strong>bash</strong> concludes that the user meant to end the entire script,
and acts on the</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGINT</strong> (e.g., by running a</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGINT</strong> trap or exiting itself);</p>
<ol>
<li value="2">If the command does not terminate due to</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>SIGINT</strong>, the program handled the</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGINT</strong> itself and did not treat it as a fatal signal. In that case,
<strong>bash</strong> does not treat</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGINT</strong> as a fatal signal, either, instead assuming that the</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGINT</strong> was used as part of the program&#39;s normal operation (e.g., emacs
uses it to abort editing commands) or deliberately discarded. However,
<strong>bash</strong> will run any trap set on</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGINT</strong>, as it does with any other trapped signal it receives while it
is waiting for the foreground command to complete, for compatibility.</p>

<h2 id="headline-55">
JOB CONTROL
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-55" class="outline-text-2">
<p><em>Job control</em> refers to the ability to selectively stop (<em>suspend</em>) the
execution of processes and continue (<em>resume</em>) their execution at a
later point. A user typically employs this facility via an interactive
interface supplied jointly by the operating system kernel&#39;s terminal
driver and <strong>bash</strong>.</p>
<p>
The shell associates a <em>job</em> with each pipeline. It keeps a table of
currently executing jobs, which may be listed with the <strong>jobs</strong> command.
When <strong>bash</strong> starts a job asynchronously (in the <em>background</em>), it prints
a line that looks like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[1] 25647</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
indicating that this job is job number 1 and that the process ID of the
last process in the pipeline associated with this job is 25647. All of
the processes in a single pipeline are members of the same job. <strong>Bash</strong>
uses the <em>job</em> abstraction as the basis for job control.</p>
<p>
To facilitate the implementation of the user interface to job control,
the operating system maintains the notion of a <em>current terminal</em>
process group ID. Members of this process group (processes whose process
group ID is equal to the current terminal process group ID) receive
keyboard-generated signals such as</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGINT</strong>. These processes are said to be in the <em>foreground</em>.
<em>Background</em> processes are those whose process group ID differs from the
terminal&#39;s; such processes are immune to keyboard-generated signals.
Only foreground processes are allowed to read from or, if the user so
specifies with <code class="verbatim">stty tostop</code>, write to the terminal. Background
processes which attempt to read from (write to when <code class="verbatim">stty tostop</code> is in
effect) the terminal are sent a</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGTTIN (SIGTTOU)</strong> signal by the kernel&#39;s terminal driver, which,
unless caught, suspends the process.</p>
<p>
If the operating system on which <strong>bash</strong> is running supports job control,
<strong>bash</strong> contains facilities to use it. Typing the <em>suspend</em> character
(typically <strong>^Z</strong>, Control-Z) while a process is running causes that
process to be stopped and returns control to <strong>bash</strong>. Typing the <em>delayed
suspend</em> character (typically <strong>^Y</strong>, Control-Y) causes the process to be
stopped when it attempts to read input from the terminal, and control to
be returned to <strong>bash</strong>. The user may then manipulate the state of this
job, using the <strong>bg</strong> command to continue it in the background, the <strong>fg</strong>
command to continue it in the foreground, or the <strong>kill</strong> command to kill
it. A <strong>^Z</strong> takes effect immediately, and has the additional side effect
of causing pending output and typeahead to be discarded.</p>
<p>
There are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell. The character
<strong>%</strong> introduces a job specification (<em>jobspec</em>). Job number <em>n</em> may be
referred to as <strong>%n</strong>. A job may also be referred to using a prefix of the
name used to start it, or using a substring that appears in its command
line. For example, <strong>%ce</strong> refers to a stopped job whose command name
begins with <strong>ce</strong>. If a prefix matches more than one job, <strong>bash</strong> reports
an error. Using <strong>%?ce</strong>, on the other hand, refers to any job containing
the string <strong>ce</strong> in its command line. If the substring matches more than
one job, <strong>bash</strong> reports an error. The symbols <strong>%%</strong> and <strong>%+</strong> refer to the
shell&#39;s notion of the <em>current job</em>, which is the last job stopped while
it was in the foreground or started in the background. The <em>previous
job</em> may be referenced using <strong>%-</strong>. If there is only a single job, <strong>%+</strong>
and <strong>%-</strong> can both be used to refer to that job. In output pertaining to
jobs (e.g., the output of the <strong>jobs</strong> command), the current job is always
flagged with a <strong>+</strong>, and the previous job with a <strong>-</strong>. A single % (with no
accompanying job specification) also refers to the current job.</p>
<p>
Simply naming a job can be used to bring it into the foreground: <strong>%1</strong> is
a synonym for <strong>``fg %1&#39;&#39;</strong>, bringing job 1 from the background into the
foreground. Similarly, <strong>``%1 &amp;&#39;&#39;</strong> resumes job 1 in the background,
equivalent to <strong>``bg %1&#39;&#39;</strong>.</p>
<p>
The shell learns immediately whenever a job changes state. Normally,
<strong>bash</strong> waits until it is about to print a prompt before reporting
changes in a job&#39;s status so as to not interrupt any other output. If
the <strong>-b</strong> option to the <strong>set</strong> builtin command is enabled, <strong>bash</strong> reports
such changes immediately. Any trap on</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGCHLD</strong> is executed for each child that exits.</p>
<p>
If an attempt to exit <strong>bash</strong> is made while jobs are stopped (or, if the
<strong>checkjobs</strong> shell option has been enabled using the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin,
running), the shell prints a warning message, and, if the <strong>checkjobs</strong>
option is enabled, lists the jobs and their statuses. The <strong>jobs</strong> command
may then be used to inspect their status. If a second attempt to exit is
made without an intervening command, the shell does not print another
warning, and any stopped jobs are terminated.</p>
<p>
When the shell is waiting for a job or process using the <strong>wait</strong> builtin,
and job control is enabled, <strong>wait</strong> will return when the job changes
state. The <strong>-f</strong> option causes <strong>wait</strong> to wait until the job or process
terminates before returning.</p>

The command number and the history number are usually different: the
history number of a command is its position in the history list, which
may include commands restored from the history file (see</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTORY</strong> below), while the command number is the position in the
sequence of commands executed during the current shell session. After
the string is decoded, it is expanded via parameter expansion, command
substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal, subject to the
value of the <strong>promptvars</strong> shell option (see the description of the
<strong>shopt</strong> command under</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below). This can have unwanted side effects if
escaped portions of the string appear within command substitution or
contain characters special to word expansion.</p>

READLINE
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-57" class="outline-text-2">
<p>This is the library that handles reading input when using an interactive
shell, unless the <strong>–noediting</strong> option is given at shell invocation.
Line editing is also used when using the <strong>-e</strong> option to the <strong>read</strong>
builtin. By default, the line editing commands are similar to those of
Emacs. A vi-style line editing interface is also available. Line editing
can be enabled at any time using the <strong>-o emacs</strong> or <strong>-o vi</strong> options to
the <strong>set</strong> builtin (see</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below). To turn off line editing after the
shell is running, use the <strong>+o emacs</strong> or <strong>+o vi</strong> options to the <strong>set</strong>
builtin.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-58" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-58">
Readline Notation
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-58" class="outline-text-3">
<p>In this section, the Emacs-style notation is used to denote keystrokes.
Control keys are denoted by C-<em>key</em>, e.g., C-n means Control-N.
Similarly, <em>meta</em> keys are denoted by M-<em>key</em>, so M-x means Meta-X. (On
keyboards without a <em>meta</em> key, M-<em>x</em> means ESC <em>x</em>, i.e., press the
Escape key then the <em>x</em> key. This makes ESC the <em>meta prefix</em>. The
combination M-C-<em>x</em> means ESC-Control-<em>x</em>, or press the Escape key then
hold the Control key while pressing the <em>x</em> key.)</p>
<p>
Readline commands may be given numeric <em>arguments</em>, which normally act
as a repeat count. Sometimes, however, it is the sign of the argument
that is significant. Passing a negative argument to a command that acts
in the forward direction (e.g., <strong>kill-line</strong>) causes that command to act
in a backward direction. Commands whose behavior with arguments deviates
from this are noted below.</p>
<p>
When a command is described as <em>killing</em> text, the text deleted is saved
for possible future retrieval (<em>yanking</em>). The killed text is saved in a
<em>kill ring</em>. Consecutive kills cause the text to be accumulated into one
unit, which can be yanked all at once. Commands which do not kill text
separate the chunks of text on the kill ring.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-59" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-59">
Readline Initialization
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-59" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Readline is customized by putting commands in an initialization file
(the <em>inputrc</em> file). The name of this file is taken from the value of
the</p>
<p>
<strong>INPUTRC</strong> variable. If that variable is unset, the default is
<em>~</em>.inputrc/. If that file does not exist or cannot be read, the
ultimate default is <em>/etc/inputrc</em>. When a program which uses the
readline library starts up, the initialization file is read, and the key
bindings and variables are set. There are only a few basic constructs
allowed in the readline initialization file. Blank lines are ignored.
Lines beginning with a <strong>#</strong> are comments. Lines beginning with a <strong>$</strong>
indicate conditional constructs. Other lines denote key bindings and
variable settings.</p>
<p>
The default key-bindings may be changed with an <em>inputrc</em> file. Other
programs that use this library may add their own commands and bindings.</p>
<p>
For example, placing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>M-Control-u: universal-argument</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C-Meta-u: universal-argument</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
into the <em>inputrc</em> would make M-C-u execute the readline command
<em>universal-argument</em>.</p>
<p>
The following symbolic character names are recognized: <em>RUBOUT</em>, <em>DEL</em>,
<em>ESC</em>, <em>LFD</em>, <em>NEWLINE</em>, <em>RET</em>, <em>RETURN</em>, <em>SPC</em>, <em>SPACE</em>, and <em>TAB</em>.</p>
<p>
In addition to command names, readline allows keys to be bound to a
string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a <em>macro</em>).</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-headline-60" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-60">
Readline Key Bindings
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-60" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The syntax for controlling key bindings in the <em>inputrc</em> file is simple.
All that is required is the name of the command or the text of a macro
and a key sequence to which it should be bound. The name may be
specified in one of two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with
<em>Meta-</em> or <em>Control-</em> prefixes, or as a key sequence.</p>
<p>
When using the form <strong>keyname</strong>: <em>function-name</em> or <em>macro</em>, <em>keyname</em> is
the name of a key spelled out in English. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Control-u: universal-argument<br>
Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word<br>
Control-o: &#34;&gt; output&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the above example, <em>C-u</em> is bound to the function
<strong>universal-argument</strong>, <em>M-DEL</em> is bound to the function
<strong>backward-kill-word</strong>, and <em>C-o</em> is bound to run the macro expressed on
the right hand side (that is, to insert the text ``&gt; output&#39;&#39; into the
line).</p>
<p>
In the second form, <strong>&#34;keyseq&#34;</strong>: <em>function-name</em> or <em>macro</em>, <strong>keyseq</strong>
differs from <strong>keyname</strong> above in that strings denoting an entire key
sequence may be specified by placing the sequence within double quotes.
Some GNU Emacs style key escapes can be used, as in the following
example, but the symbolic character names are not recognized.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;\C-u&#34;: universal-argument<br>
&#34;\C-x\C-r&#34;: re-read-init-file<br>
&#34;\e[11~&#34;: &#34;Function Key 1&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In this example, <em>C-u</em> is again bound to the function
<strong>universal-argument</strong>. <em>C-x C-r</em> is bound to the function
<strong>re-read-init-file</strong>, and <em>ESC [ 1 1 ~</em> is bound to insert the text
``Function Key 1&#39;&#39;.</p>
<p>
The full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences is</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>\C-</strong>
</dt>
<dd>control prefix</dd>
<dt>
<strong>\M-</strong>
</dt>
<dd>meta prefix</dd>
<dt>
<strong>\e</strong>
</dt>
<dd>an escape character</dd>
<dt>
<strong>\\</strong>
</dt>
<dd>backslash</dd>
<dt>
<strong>\&#34;</strong>
</dt>
<dd>literal &#34;</dd>
<dt>
<strong>\&#39;</strong>
</dt>
<dd>literal &#39;</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
In addition to the GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a second set of
backslash escapes is available:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>\a</strong>
</dt>
<dd>alert (bell)</dd>
<dt>
<strong>\b</strong>
</dt>
<dd>backspace</dd>
<dt>
<strong>\d</strong>
</dt>
<dd>delete</dd>
<dt>
<strong>\f</strong>
</dt>
<dd>form feed</dd>
<dt>
<strong>\n</strong>
</dt>
<dd>newline</dd>
<dt>
<strong>\r</strong>
</dt>
<dd>carriage return</dd>
<dt>
<strong>\t</strong>
</dt>
<dd>horizontal tab</dd>
<dt>
<strong>\v</strong>
</dt>
<dd>vertical tab</dd>
<dt>
<strong>\/nnn/</strong>
</dt>
<dd>the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value
<em>nnn</em> (one to three digits)</dd>
<dt>
<strong>\x/HH/</strong>
</dt>
<dd>the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal
value <em>HH</em> (one or two hex digits)</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes must be used
to indicate a macro definition. Unquoted text is assumed to be a
function name. In the macro body, the backslash escapes described above
are expanded. Backslash will quote any other character in the macro
text, including &#34; and &#39;.</p>
<p>
<strong>Bash</strong> allows the current readline key bindings to be displayed or
modified with the <strong>bind</strong> builtin command. The editing mode may be
switched during interactive use by using the <strong>-o</strong> option to the <strong>set</strong>
builtin command (see</p>

<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below).</p>

Readline Variables
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-61" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Readline has variables that can be used to further customize its
behavior. A variable may be set in the <em>inputrc</em> file with a statement
of the form</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>set</strong> <em>variable-name</em> <em>value</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
or using the <strong>bind</strong> builtin command (see</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below).</p>
<p>
Except where noted, readline variables can take the values <strong>On</strong> or <strong>Off</strong>
(without regard to case). Unrecognized variable names are ignored. When
a variable value is read, empty or null values, &#34;on&#34; (case-insensitive),
and &#34;1&#34; are equivalent to <strong>On</strong>. All other values are equivalent to
<strong>Off</strong>. The variables and their default values are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>active-region-start-color</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A string variable that controls the
text color and background when displaying the text in the active
region (see the description of <strong>enable-active-region</strong> below). This
string must not take up any physical character positions on the
display, so it should consist only of terminal escape sequences. It is
output to the terminal before displaying the text in the active
region. This variable is reset to the default value whenever the
terminal type changes. The default value is the string that puts the
terminal in standout mode, as obtained from the terminal&#39;s terminfo
description. A sample value might be <code class="verbatim">&#34;\e[01;33m&#34;</code>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>active-region-end-color</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A string variable that &#34;undoes&#34; the
effects of <strong>active-region-start-color</strong> and restores &#34;normal&#34; terminal
display appearance after displaying text in the active region. This
string must not take up any physical character positions on the
display, so it should consist only of terminal escape sequences. It is
output to the terminal after displaying the text in the active region.
This variable is reset to the default value whenever the terminal type
changes. The default value is the string that restores the terminal
from standout mode, as obtained from the terminal&#39;s terminfo
description. A sample value might be <code class="verbatim">&#34;\e[0m&#34;</code>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>bell-style (audible)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Controls what happens when readline wants to
ring the terminal bell. If set to <strong>none</strong>, readline never rings the
bell. If set to <strong>visible</strong>, readline uses a visible bell if one is
available. If set to <strong>audible</strong>, readline attempts to ring the
terminal&#39;s bell.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>bind-tty-special-chars (On)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to <strong>On</strong>, readline attempts to
bind the control characters treated specially by the kernel&#39;s terminal
driver to their readline equivalents.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>blink-matching-paren (Off)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to <strong>On</strong>, readline attempts to
briefly move the cursor to an opening parenthesis when a closing
parenthesis is inserted.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>colored-completion-prefix (Off)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to <strong>On</strong>, when listing
completions, readline displays the common prefix of the set of
possible completions using a different color. The color definitions
are taken from the value of the <strong>LS_COLORS</strong> environment variable. If
there is a color definition in <strong>$LS_COLORS</strong> for the custom suffix
&#34;readline-colored-completion-prefix&#34;, readline uses this color for the
common prefix instead of its default.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>colored-stats (Off)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to <strong>On</strong>, readline displays possible
completions using different colors to indicate their file type. The
color definitions are taken from the value of the <strong>LS_COLORS</strong>
environment variable.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>comment-begin (``#&#39;&#39;)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The string that is inserted when the
readline <strong>insert-comment</strong> command is executed. This command is bound
to <strong>M-#</strong> in emacs mode and to <strong>#</strong> in vi command mode.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>completion-display-width (-1)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The number of screen columns used
to display possible matches when performing completion. The value is
ignored if it is less than 0 or greater than the terminal screen
width. A value of 0 will cause matches to be displayed one per line.
The default value is -1.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>completion-ignore-case (Off)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to <strong>On</strong>, readline performs
filename matching and completion in a case-insensitive fashion.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>completion-map-case (Off)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to <strong>On</strong>, and
<strong>completion-ignore-case</strong> is enabled, readline treats hyphens (<em>-</em>) and
underscores (<em>_</em>) as equivalent when performing case-insensitive
filename matching and completion.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>completion-prefix-display-length (0)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The length in characters of
the common prefix of a list of possible completions that is displayed
without modification. When set to a value greater than zero, common
prefixes longer than this value are replaced with an ellipsis when
displaying possible completions.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>completion-query-items (100)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This determines when the user is
queried about viewing the number of possible completions generated by
the <strong>possible-completions</strong> command. It may be set to any integer value
greater than or equal to zero. If the number of possible completions
is greater than or equal to the value of this variable, readline will
ask whether or not the user wishes to view them; otherwise they are
simply listed on the terminal. A zero value means readline should
never ask; negative values are treated as zero.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>convert-meta (On)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to <strong>On</strong>, readline will convert
characters with the eighth bit set to an ASCII key sequence by
stripping the eighth bit and prefixing an escape character (in effect,
using escape as the <em>meta prefix</em>). The default is <em>On</em>, but readline
will set it to <em>Off</em> if the locale contains eight-bit characters. This
variable is dependent on the <strong>LC_CTYPE</strong> locale category, and may
change if the locale is changed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>disable-completion (Off)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to <strong>On</strong>, readline will inhibit
word completion. Completion characters will be inserted into the line
as if they had been mapped to <strong>self-insert</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>echo-control-characters (On)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When set to <strong>On</strong>, on operating
systems that indicate they support it, readline echoes a character
corresponding to a signal generated from the keyboard.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>editing-mode (emacs)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Controls whether readline begins with a set
of key bindings similar to <em>Emacs</em> or <em>vi</em>. <strong>editing-mode</strong> can be set
to either <strong>emacs</strong> or <strong>vi</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>emacs-mode-string (@)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If the <em>show-mode-in-prompt</em> variable is
enabled, this string is displayed immediately before the last line of
the primary prompt when emacs editing mode is active. The value is
expanded like a key binding, so the standard set of meta- and control
prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available. Use the \1 and
\2 escapes to begin and end sequences of non-printing characters,
which can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode
string.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>enable-active-region (On)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The <em>point</em> is the current cursor
position, and <em>mark</em> refers to a saved cursor position. The text
between the point and mark is referred to as the <em>region</em>. When this
variable is set to <em>On</em>, readline allows certain commands to designate
the region as <em>active</em>. When the region is active, readline highlights
the text in the region using the value of the
<strong>active-region-start-color</strong>, which defaults to the string that enables
the terminal&#39;s standout mode. The active region shows the text
inserted by bracketed-paste and any matching text found by incremental
and non-incremental history searches.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>enable-bracketed-paste (On)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When set to <strong>On</strong>, readline configures
the terminal to insert each paste into the editing buffer as a single
string of characters, instead of treating each character as if it had
been read from the keyboard. This prevents readline from executing any
editing commands bound to key sequences appearing in the pasted text.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>enable-keypad (Off)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When set to <strong>On</strong>, readline will try to enable
the application keypad when it is called. Some systems need this to
enable the arrow keys.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>enable-meta-key (On)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When set to <strong>On</strong>, readline will try to
enable any meta modifier key the terminal claims to support when it is
called. On many terminals, the meta key is used to send eight-bit
characters.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>expand-tilde (Off)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to <strong>On</strong>, tilde expansion is performed
when readline attempts word completion.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>history-preserve-point (Off)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to <strong>On</strong>, the history code
attempts to place point at the same location on each history line
retrieved with <strong>previous-history</strong> or <strong>next-history</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>history-size (unset)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set the maximum number of history entries
saved in the history list. If set to zero, any existing history
entries are deleted and no new entries are saved. If set to a value
less than zero, the number of history entries is not limited. By
default, the number of history entries is set to the value of the
<strong>HISTSIZE</strong> shell variable. If an attempt is made to set <em>history-size</em>
to a non-numeric value, the maximum number of history entries will be
set to 500.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>horizontal-scroll-mode (Off)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When set to <strong>On</strong>, makes readline use
a single line for display, scrolling the input horizontally on a
single screen line when it becomes longer than the screen width rather
than wrapping to a new line. This setting is automatically enabled for
terminals of height 1.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>input-meta (Off)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to <strong>On</strong>, readline will enable eight-bit
input (that is, it will not strip the eighth bit from the characters
it reads), regardless of what the terminal claims it can support. The
name <strong>meta-flag</strong> is a synonym for this variable. The default is <em>Off</em>,
but readline will set it to <em>On</em> if the locale contains eight-bit
characters. This variable is dependent on the <strong>LC_CTYPE</strong> locale
category, and may change if the locale is changed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>isearch-terminators (``C-[C-J&#39;&#39;)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The string of characters that
should terminate an incremental search without subsequently executing
the character as a command. If this variable has not been given a
value, the characters <em>ESC</em> and <em>C-J</em> will terminate an incremental
search.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>keymap (emacs)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Set the current readline keymap. The set of valid
keymap names is <em>emacs, emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi,</em>
vi-command, and <em>vi-insert</em>. <em>vi</em> is equivalent to <em>vi-command</em>;
<em>emacs</em> is equivalent to <em>emacs-standard</em>. The default value is
<em>emacs</em>; the value of <strong>editing-mode</strong> also affects the default keymap.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>keyseq-timeout (500)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the duration <em>readline</em> will wait
for a character when reading an ambiguous key sequence (one that can
form a complete key sequence using the input read so far, or can take
additional input to complete a longer key sequence). If no input is
received within the timeout, <em>readline</em> will use the shorter but
complete key sequence. The value is specified in milliseconds, so a
value of 1000 means that <em>readline</em> will wait one second for
additional input. If this variable is set to a value less than or
equal to zero, or to a non-numeric value, <em>readline</em> will wait until
another key is pressed to decide which key sequence to complete.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>mark-directories (On)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to <strong>On</strong>, completed directory names
have a slash appended.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>mark-modified-lines (Off)</strong>

<dt>
<strong>output-meta (Off)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to <strong>On</strong>, readline will display
characters with the eighth bit set directly rather than as a
meta-prefixed escape sequence. The default is <em>Off</em>, but readline will
set it to <em>On</em> if the locale contains eight-bit characters. This

<dt>
<strong>revert-all-at-newline (Off)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to <strong>On</strong>, readline will undo
all changes to history lines before returning when <strong>accept-line</strong> is

<em>emacs-mode-string</em>).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>skip-completed-text (Off)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to <strong>On</strong>, this alters the default
completion behavior when inserting a single match into the line. It&#39;s
only active when performing completion in the middle of a word. If
enabled, readline does not insert characters from the completion that
match characters after point in the word being completed, so portions
of the word following the cursor are not duplicated.</dd>

<strong>vi-cmd-mode-string ((cmd))</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If the <em>show-mode-in-prompt</em> variable
is enabled, this string is displayed immediately before the last line
of the primary prompt when vi editing mode is active and in command
mode. The value is expanded like a key binding, so the standard set of
meta- and control prefixes and backslash escape sequences is
available. Use the \1 and \2 escapes to begin and end sequences of
non-printing characters, which can be used to embed a terminal control
sequence into the mode string.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>vi-ins-mode-string ((ins))</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If the <em>show-mode-in-prompt</em> variable
is enabled, this string is displayed immediately before the last line
of the primary prompt when vi editing mode is active and in insertion

Readline Conditional Constructs
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-62" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Readline implements a facility similar in spirit to the conditional
compilation features of the C preprocessor which allows key bindings and
variable settings to be performed as the result of tests. There are four
parser directives used.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
$if
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>$if</strong> construct allows bindings to be made based on the
editing mode, the terminal being used, or the application using
readline. The text of the test, after any comparison operator, extends
to the end of the line; unless otherwise noted, no characters are
required to isolate it.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
mode
</dt>
<dd>The <strong>mode=</strong> form of the <strong>$if</strong> directive is used to test
whether readline is in emacs or vi mode. This may be used in
conjunction with the <strong>set keymap</strong> command, for instance, to set
bindings in the <em>emacs-standard</em> and <em>emacs-ctlx</em> keymaps only if
readline is starting out in emacs mode.</dd>
<dt>
term
</dt>
<dd>The <strong>term=</strong> form may be used to include terminal-specific
key bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by the
terminal&#39;s function keys. The word on the right side of the <strong>=</strong> is
tested against both the full name of the terminal and the portion of
the terminal name before the first <strong>-</strong>. This allows <em>sun</em> to match
both <em>sun</em> and <em>sun-cmd</em>, for instance.</dd>
<dt>
version
</dt>
<dd>The <strong>version</strong> test may be used to perform comparisons
against specific readline versions. The <strong>version</strong> expands to the
current readline version. The set of comparison operators includes
<strong>=</strong>, (and <strong>==</strong>), <strong>!=</strong>, <strong>&lt;=</strong>, <strong>&gt;=</strong>, <strong>&lt;</strong>, and <strong>&gt;</strong>. The version number
supplied on the right side of the operator consists of a major
version number, an optional decimal point, and an optional minor
version (e.g., <strong>7.1</strong>). If the minor version is omitted, it is
assumed to be <strong>0</strong>. The operator may be separated from the string
<strong>version</strong> and from the version number argument by whitespace.</dd>
<dt>
application
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>application</strong> construct is used to include
application-specific settings. Each program using the readline
library sets the <em>application name</em>, and an initialization file can
test for a particular value. This could be used to bind key
sequences to functions useful for a specific program. For instance,
the following command adds a key sequence that quotes the current or
previous word in <strong>bash</strong>:</p>
<pre class="example">
$if Bash
# Quote the current or previous word
&#34;\C-xq&#34;: &#34;\eb\&#34;\ef\&#34;&#34;
$endif
</pre>
</dd>
<dt>
variable
</dt>
<dd>The <em>variable</em> construct provides simple equality tests
for readline variables and values. The permitted comparison
operators are <em>=</em>, <em>==</em>, and <em>!=</em>. The variable name must be
separated from the comparison operator by whitespace; the operator
may be separated from the value on the right hand side by
whitespace. Both string and boolean variables may be tested. Boolean
variables must be tested against the values <em>on</em> and <em>off</em>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
$endif
</dt>
<dd>This command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an
<strong>$if</strong> command.</dd>
<dt>
$else
</dt>
<dd>Commands in this branch of the <strong>$if</strong> directive are executed
if the test fails.</dd>
<dt>
$include
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This directive takes a single filename as an argument and
reads commands and bindings from that file. For example, the following
directive would read <em>/etc/inputrc</em>:</p>
<pre class="example">
$include   /etc/inputrc
</pre>

Searching
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-63" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Readline provides commands for searching through the command history
(see</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTORY</strong> below) for lines containing a specified string. There are two
search modes: <em>incremental</em> and <em>non-incremental</em>.</p>
<p>
Incremental searches begin before the user has finished typing the
search string. As each character of the search string is typed, readline
displays the next entry from the history matching the string typed so
far. An incremental search requires only as many characters as needed to
find the desired history entry. The characters present in the value of
the <strong>isearch-terminators</strong> variable are used to terminate an incremental
search. If that variable has not been assigned a value the Escape and
Control-J characters will terminate an incremental search. Control-G
will abort an incremental search and restore the original line. When the
search is terminated, the history entry containing the search string
becomes the current line.</p>
<p>
To find other matching entries in the history list, type Control-S or
Control-R as appropriate. This will search backward or forward in the
history for the next entry matching the search string typed so far. Any
other key sequence bound to a readline command will terminate the search
and execute that command. For instance, a <em>newline</em> will terminate the
search and accept the line, thereby executing the command from the
history list.</p>
<p>
Readline remembers the last incremental search string. If two Control-Rs
are typed without any intervening characters defining a new search
string, any remembered search string is used.</p>
<p>
Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before starting
to search for matching history lines. The search string may be typed by
the user or be part of the contents of the current line.</p>

Commands for Changing Text
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-67" class="outline-text-3">
<dl>

commonly is, see above for the effects.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>backward-delete-char (Rubout)</strong>

<strong>tab-insert (C-v TAB)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Insert a tab character.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>self-insert (a, b, A, 1, !, …)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Insert the character typed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>transpose-chars (C-t)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Drag the character before point forward
over the character at point, moving point forward as well. If point is
at the end of the line, then this transposes the two characters before
point. Negative arguments have no effect.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>transpose-words (M-t)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Drag the word before point past the word
after point, moving point over that word as well. If point is at the
end of the line, this transposes the last two words on the line.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>upcase-word (M-u)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Uppercase the current (or following) word. With
a negative argument, uppercase the previous word, but do not move
point.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>downcase-word (M-l)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Lowercase the current (or following) word.
With a negative argument, lowercase the previous word, but do not move
point.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>capitalize-word (M-c)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Capitalize the current (or following) word.
With a negative argument, capitalize the previous word, but do not
move point.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>overwrite-mode</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Toggle overwrite mode. With an explicit positive
numeric argument, switches to overwrite mode. With an explicit
non-positive numeric argument, switches to insert mode. This command
affects only <strong>emacs</strong> mode; <strong>vi</strong> mode does overwrite differently. Each
call to <em>readline()</em> starts in insert mode. In overwrite mode,
characters bound to <strong>self-insert</strong> replace the text at point rather
than pushing the text to the right. Characters bound to
<strong>backward-delete-char</strong> replace the character before point with a
space. By default, this command is unbound.</dd>

Programmable Completion
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-73" class="outline-text-3">
<p>When word completion is attempted for an argument to a command for which
a completion specification (a <em>compspec</em>) has been defined using the
<strong>complete</strong> builtin (see</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below), the programmable completion facilities
are invoked.</p>
<p>
First, the command name is identified. If the command word is the empty
string (completion attempted at the beginning of an empty line), any
compspec defined with the <strong>-E</strong> option to <strong>complete</strong> is used. If a
compspec has been defined for that command, the compspec is used to
generate the list of possible completions for the word. If the command
word is a full pathname, a compspec for the full pathname is searched
for first. If no compspec is found for the full pathname, an attempt is
made to find a compspec for the portion following the final slash. If
those searches do not result in a compspec, any compspec defined with
the <strong>-D</strong> option to <strong>complete</strong> is used as the default. If there is no
default compspec, <strong>bash</strong> attempts alias expansion on the command word as
a final resort, and attempts to find a compspec for the command word
from any successful expansion.</p>
<p>
Once a compspec has been found, it is used to generate the list of
matching words. If a compspec is not found, the default <strong>bash</strong>
completion as described above under <strong>Completing</strong> is performed.</p>
<p>
First, the actions specified by the compspec are used. Only matches
which are prefixed by the word being completed are returned. When the
<strong>-f</strong> or <strong>-d</strong> option is used for filename or directory name completion,
the shell variable</p>
<p>
<strong>FIGNORE</strong> is used to filter the matches.</p>
<p>
Any completions specified by a pathname expansion pattern to the <strong>-G</strong>
option are generated next. The words generated by the pattern need not
match the word being completed. The</p>
<p>
<strong>GLOBIGNORE</strong> shell variable is not used to filter the matches, but the</p>
<p>
<strong>FIGNORE</strong> variable is used.</p>
<p>
Next, the string specified as the argument to the <strong>-W</strong> option is
considered. The string is first split using the characters in the</p>
<p>
<strong>IFS</strong> special variable as delimiters. Shell quoting is honored. Each
word is then expanded using brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter
and variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion,
as described above under</p>
<p>
<strong>EXPANSION</strong>. The results are split using the rules described above under
<strong>Word Splitting</strong>. The results of the expansion are prefix-matched
against the word being completed, and the matching words become the
possible completions.</p>
<p>
After these matches have been generated, any shell function or command
specified with the <strong>-F</strong> and <strong>-C</strong> options is invoked. When the command or
function is invoked, the</p>
<p>
<strong>COMP_LINE</strong>,</p>
<p>
<strong>COMP_POINT</strong>,</p>
<p>
<strong>COMP_KEY</strong>, and</p>
<p>
<strong>COMP_TYPE</strong> variables are assigned values as described above under
<strong>Shell Variables</strong>. If a shell function is being invoked, the</p>
<p>
<strong>COMP_WORDS</strong> and</p>
<p>
<strong>COMP_CWORD</strong> variables are also set. When the function or command is
invoked, the first argument (<strong>$1</strong>) is the name of the command whose
arguments are being completed, the second argument (<strong>$2</strong>) is the word
being completed, and the third argument (<strong>$3</strong>) is the word preceding the
word being completed on the current command line. No filtering of the
generated completions against the word being completed is performed; the
function or command has complete freedom in generating the matches.</p>
<p>
Any function specified with <strong>-F</strong> is invoked first. The function may use
any of the shell facilities, including the <strong>compgen</strong> builtin described
below, to generate the matches. It must put the possible completions in
the</p>
<p>
<strong>COMPREPLY</strong> array variable, one per array element.</p>
<p>
Next, any command specified with the <strong>-C</strong> option is invoked in an
environment equivalent to command substitution. It should print a list
of completions, one per line, to the standard output. Backslash may be
used to escape a newline, if necessary.</p>
<p>
After all of the possible completions are generated, any filter
specified with the <strong>-X</strong> option is applied to the list. The filter is a
pattern as used for pathname expansion; a <strong>&amp;</strong> in the pattern is replaced
with the text of the word being completed. A literal <strong>&amp;</strong> may be escaped
with a backslash; the backslash is removed before attempting a match.
Any completion that matches the pattern will be removed from the list. A
leading <strong>!</strong> negates the pattern; in this case any completion not
matching the pattern will be removed. If the <strong>nocasematch</strong> shell option
is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of
alphabetic characters.</p>
<p>
Finally, any prefix and suffix specified with the <strong>-P</strong> and <strong>-S</strong> options
are added to each member of the completion list, and the result is
returned to the readline completion code as the list of possible
completions.</p>
<p>
If the previously-applied actions do not generate any matches, and the
<strong>-o dirnames</strong> option was supplied to <strong>complete</strong> when the compspec was
defined, directory name completion is attempted.</p>
<p>
If the <strong>-o plusdirs</strong> option was supplied to <strong>complete</strong> when the compspec
was defined, directory name completion is attempted and any matches are
added to the results of the other actions.</p>
<p>
By default, if a compspec is found, whatever it generates is returned to
the completion code as the full set of possible completions. The default
<strong>bash</strong> completions are not attempted, and the readline default of
filename completion is disabled. If the <strong>-o bashdefault</strong> option was
supplied to <strong>complete</strong> when the compspec was defined, the <strong>bash</strong> default
completions are attempted if the compspec generates no matches. If the
<strong>-o default</strong> option was supplied to <strong>complete</strong> when the compspec was
defined, readline&#39;s default completion will be performed if the compspec
(and, if attempted, the default <strong>bash</strong> completions) generate no matches.</p>
<p>
When a compspec indicates that directory name completion is desired, the
programmable completion functions force readline to append a slash to
completed names which are symbolic links to directories, subject to the
value of the <strong>mark-directories</strong> readline variable, regardless of the
setting of the <strong>mark-symlinked-directories</strong> readline variable.</p>
<p>
There is some support for dynamically modifying completions. This is
most useful when used in combination with a default completion specified
with <strong>complete -D</strong>. It&#39;s possible for shell functions executed as
completion handlers to indicate that completion should be retried by
returning an exit status of 124. If a shell function returns 124, and
changes the compspec associated with the command on which completion is
being attempted (supplied as the first argument when the function is
executed), programmable completion restarts from the beginning, with an
attempt to find a new compspec for that command. This allows a set of
completions to be built dynamically as completion is attempted, rather
than being loaded all at once.</p>
<p>
For instance, assuming that there is a library of compspecs, each kept
in a file corresponding to the name of the command, the following
default completion function would load completions dynamically:</p>
<p>
<code class="verbatim">_completion_loader()</code><br>
{<br>
. &#34;/etc/bash_completion.d/$1.sh&#34; &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; return 124<br>
}<br>
complete -D -F _completion_loader -o bashdefault -o default\\</p>

HISTORY
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-74" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When the <strong>-o history</strong> option to the <strong>set</strong> builtin is enabled, the shell
provides access to the <em>command history</em>, the list of commands
previously typed. The value of the</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTSIZE</strong> variable is used as the number of commands to save in a
history list. The text of the last</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTSIZE</strong> commands (default 500) is saved. The shell stores each
command in the history list prior to parameter and variable expansion
(see</p>
<p>
<strong>EXPANSION</strong> above) but after history expansion is performed, subject to
the values of the shell variables</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTIGNORE</strong> and</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTCONTROL</strong>.</p>
<p>
On startup, the history is initialized from the file named by the
variable</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTFILE</strong> (default <em>~</em>.bash_history/). The file named by the value of</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTFILE</strong> is truncated, if necessary, to contain no more than the
number of lines specified by the value of</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTFILESIZE</strong>. If <strong>HISTFILESIZE</strong> is unset, or set to null, a
non-numeric value, or a numeric value less than zero, the history file
is not truncated. When the history file is read, lines beginning with
the history comment character followed immediately by a digit are
interpreted as timestamps for the following history line. These
timestamps are optionally displayed depending on the value of the</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTTIMEFORMAT</strong> variable. When a shell with history enabled exits, the
last</p>
<p>
<strong>$HISTSIZE</strong> lines are copied from the history list to</p>
<p>
<strong>$HISTFILE</strong>. If the <strong>histappend</strong> shell option is enabled (see the
description of <strong>shopt</strong> under</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below), the lines are appended to the history
file, otherwise the history file is overwritten. If</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTFILE</strong> is unset, or if the history file is unwritable, the history
is not saved. If the</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTTIMEFORMAT</strong> variable is set, time stamps are written to the history
file, marked with the history comment character, so they may be
preserved across shell sessions. This uses the history comment character
to distinguish timestamps from other history lines. After saving the
history, the history file is truncated to contain no more than</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTFILESIZE</strong> lines. If</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTFILESIZE</strong> is unset, or set to null, a non-numeric value, or a
numeric value less than zero, the history file is not truncated.</p>
<p>
The builtin command <strong>fc</strong> (see</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below) may be used to list or edit and
re-execute a portion of the history list. The <strong>history</strong> builtin may be
used to display or modify the history list and manipulate the history
file. When using command-line editing, search commands are available in
each editing mode that provide access to the history list.</p>
<p>
The shell allows control over which commands are saved on the history
list. The</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTCONTROL</strong> and</p>
<p>
<strong>HISTIGNORE</strong> variables may be set to cause the shell to save only a
subset of the commands entered. The <strong>cmdhist</strong> shell option, if enabled,
causes the shell to attempt to save each line of a multi-line command in
the same history entry, adding semicolons where necessary to preserve
syntactic correctness. The <strong>lithist</strong> shell option causes the shell to
save the command with embedded newlines instead of semicolons. See the
description of the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin below under</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> for information on setting and unsetting shell
options.</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-75" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-75">
HISTORY EXPANSION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-75" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The shell supports a history expansion feature that is similar to the
history expansion in <strong>csh</strong>. This section describes what syntax features
are available. This feature is enabled by default for interactive
shells, and can be disabled using the <strong>+H</strong> option to the <strong>set</strong> builtin
command (see</p>
<p>
<strong>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</strong> below). Non-interactive shells do not perform
history expansion by default.</p>
<p>
History expansions introduce words from the history list into the input
stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the arguments to a
previous command into the current input line, or fix errors in previous
commands quickly.</p>
<p>
History expansion is performed immediately after a complete line is
read, before the shell breaks it into words, and is performed on each
line individually without taking quoting on previous lines into account.
It takes place in two parts. The first is to determine which line from
the history list to use during substitution. The second is to select
portions of that line for inclusion into the current one. The line
selected from the history is the <em>event</em>, and the portions of that line
that are acted upon are <em>words</em>. Various <em>modifiers</em> are available to
manipulate the selected words. The line is broken into words in the same
fashion as when reading input, so that several <em>metacharacter</em>-separated
words surrounded by quotes are considered one word. History expansions
are introduced by the appearance of the history expansion character,
which is  <strong>!</strong>  by default. Only backslash ( <strong>\</strong> ) and single quotes can
quote the history expansion character, but the history expansion
character is also treated as quoted if it immediately precedes the
closing double quote in a double-quoted string.</p>
<p>
Several characters inhibit history expansion if found immediately
following the history expansion character, even if it is unquoted:
space, tab, newline, carriage return, and <strong>=</strong>. If the <strong>extglob</strong> shell
option is enabled, <strong>(</strong> will also inhibit expansion.</p>
<p>
Several shell options settable with the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin may be used to
tailor the behavior of history expansion. If the <strong>histverify</strong> shell
option is enabled (see the description of the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin below),
and <strong>readline</strong> is being used, history substitutions are not immediately
passed to the shell parser. Instead, the expanded line is reloaded into
the <strong>readline</strong> editing buffer for further modification. If <strong>readline</strong> is
being used, and the <strong>histreedit</strong> shell option is enabled, a failed
history substitution will be reloaded into the <strong>readline</strong> editing buffer
for correction. The <strong>-p</strong> option to the <strong>history</strong> builtin command may be
used to see what a history expansion will do before using it. The <strong>-s</strong>
option to the <strong>history</strong> builtin may be used to add commands to the end
of the history list without actually executing them, so that they are
available for subsequent recall.</p>
<p>
The shell allows control of the various characters used by the history
expansion mechanism (see the description of <strong>histchars</strong> above under
<strong>Shell Variables</strong>). The shell uses the history comment character to mark
history timestamps when writing the history file.</p>

SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS

<div id="outline-text-headline-79" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this section
as accepting options preceded by <strong>-</strong> accepts <strong>–</strong> to signify the end of
the options. The <strong>:</strong>, <strong>true</strong>, <strong>false</strong>, and <strong>test*/</strong>[* builtins do not
accept options and do not treat <strong>–</strong> specially. The <strong>exit</strong>, <strong>logout</strong>,
<strong>return</strong>, <strong>break</strong>, <strong>continue</strong>, <strong>let</strong>, and <strong>shift</strong> builtins accept and
process arguments beginning with <strong>-</strong> without requiring <strong>–</strong>. Other
builtins that accept arguments but are not specified as accepting
options interpret arguments beginning with <strong>-</strong> as invalid options and
require <strong>–</strong> to prevent this interpretation.</p>
<dl>

<p>No effect; the command does nothing beyond expanding <em>arguments</em> and

<p>Read and execute commands from <em>filename</em> in the current shell
environment and return the exit status of the last command executed from
<em>filename</em>. If <em>filename</em> does not contain a slash, filenames in</p>
<p>
<strong>PATH</strong> are used to find the directory containing <em>filename</em>, but
<em>filename</em> does not need to be executable. The file searched for in</p>
<p>
<strong>PATH</strong> need not be executable. When <strong>bash</strong> is not in <em>posix mode</em>, it
searches the current directory if no file is found in</p>
<p>
<strong>PATH</strong>. If the <strong>sourcepath</strong> option to the <strong>shopt</strong> builtin command is
turned off, the</p>
<p>
<strong>PATH</strong> is not searched. If any <em>arguments</em> are supplied, they become the
positional parameters when <em>filename</em> is executed. Otherwise the
positional parameters are unchanged. If the <strong>-T</strong> option is enabled, <strong>.</strong>
inherits any trap on <strong>DEBUG</strong>; if it is not, any <strong>DEBUG</strong> trap string is
saved and restored around the call to <strong>.</strong>, and <strong>.</strong> unsets the <strong>DEBUG</strong>
trap while it executes. If <strong>-T</strong> is not set, and the sourced file changes
the <strong>DEBUG</strong> trap, the new value is retained when <strong>.</strong> completes. The
return status is the status of the last command exited within the script
(0 if no commands are executed), and false if <em>filename</em> is not found or
cannot be read.</p>

<em>name/=/value</em> on standard output. When arguments are supplied, an
alias is defined for each <em>name</em> whose <em>value</em> is given. A trailing
space in <em>value</em> causes the next word to be checked for alias
substitution when the alias is expanded. For each <em>name</em> in the
argument list for which no <em>value</em> is supplied, the name and value of
the alias is printed. <strong>Alias</strong> returns true unless a <em>name</em> is given

<strong>builtin</strong> <em>shell-builtin</em> [/arguments/]
</dt>
<dd>Execute the specified shell
builtin, passing it <em>arguments</em>, and return its exit status. This is
useful when defining a function whose name is the same as a shell
builtin, retaining the functionality of the builtin within the
function. The <strong>cd</strong> builtin is commonly redefined this way. The return
status is false if <em>shell-builtin</em> is not a shell builtin command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>caller</strong> [/expr/]
</dt>
<dd>Returns the context of any active subroutine call
(a shell function or a script executed with the <strong>.</strong> or <strong>source</strong>
builtins). Without <em>expr</em>, <strong>caller</strong> displays the line number and
source filename of the current subroutine call. If a non-negative
integer is supplied as <em>expr</em>, <strong>caller</strong> displays the line number,
subroutine name, and source file corresponding to that position in the
current execution call stack. This extra information may be used, for
example, to print a stack trace. The current frame is frame 0. The
return value is 0 unless the shell is not executing a subroutine call
or <em>expr</em> does not correspond to a valid position in the call stack.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>cd</strong> [*-L*|[*-P* [*-e*]] [-@]] [/dir/]
</dt>
<dd>Change the current directory
to <em>dir</em>. if <em>dir</em> is not supplied, the value of the</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>HOME</strong> shell variable is the default. The variable</p>
<p>
<strong>CDPATH</strong> defines the search path for the directory containing <em>dir</em>:
each directory name in</p>
<p>
<strong>CDPATH</strong> is searched for <em>dir</em>. Alternative directory names in</p>
<p>
<strong>CDPATH</strong> are separated by a colon (:). A null directory name in</p>
<p>
<strong>CDPATH</strong> is the same as the current directory, i.e., ``*.*&#39;&#39;. If <em>dir</em>
begins with a slash (/), then</p>
<p>
<strong>CDPATH</strong> is not used. The <strong>-P</strong> option causes <strong>cd</strong> to use the physical
directory structure by resolving symbolic links while traversing <em>dir</em>
and before processing instances of <em>..</em> in <em>dir</em> (see also the <strong>-P</strong>
option to the <strong>set</strong> builtin command); the <strong>-L</strong> option forces symbolic
links to be followed by resolving the link after processing instances of
<em>..</em> in <em>dir</em>. If <em>..</em> appears in <em>dir</em>, it is processed by removing the
immediately previous pathname component from <em>dir</em>, back to a slash or
the beginning of <em>dir</em>. If the <strong>-e</strong> option is supplied with <strong>-P</strong>, and
the current working directory cannot be successfully determined after a
successful directory change, <strong>cd</strong> will return an unsuccessful status. On
systems that support it, the <strong>-@</strong> option presents the extended
attributes associated with a file as a directory. An argument of <strong>-</strong> is
converted to</p>
<p>
<strong>$OLDPWD</strong> before the directory change is attempted. If a non-empty
directory name from</p>
<p>
<strong>CDPATH</strong> is used, or if <strong>-</strong> is the first argument, and the directory
change is successful, the absolute pathname of the new working directory
is written to the standard output. If the directory change is
successful, <strong>cd</strong> sets the value of the <strong>PWD</strong> environment variable to the
new directory name, and sets the <strong>OLDPWD</strong> environment variable to the
value of the current working directory before the change. The return
value is true if the directory was successfully changed; false
otherwise.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>command</strong> [*-pVv*] <em>command</em> [/arg/ …]
</dt>
<dd>Run <em>command</em> with <em>args</em>
suppressing the normal shell function lookup. Only builtin commands or
commands found in the</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>PATH</strong> are executed. If the <strong>-p</strong> option is given, the search for
<em>command</em> is performed using a default value for</p>
<p>
<strong>PATH</strong> that is guaranteed to find all of the standard utilities. If
either the <strong>-V</strong> or <strong>-v</strong> option is supplied, a description of <em>command</em>
is printed. The <strong>-v</strong> option causes a single word indicating the command
or filename used to invoke <em>command</em> to be displayed; the <strong>-V</strong> option
produces a more verbose description. If the <strong>-V</strong> or <strong>-v</strong> option is
supplied, the exit status is 0 if <em>command</em> was found, and 1 if not. If
neither option is supplied and an error occurred or <em>command</em> cannot be
found, the exit status is 127. Otherwise, the exit status of the
<strong>command</strong> builtin is the exit status of <em>command</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>compgen</strong> [/option/] [/word/]
</dt>
<dd>Generate possible completion matches
for <em>word</em> according to the /option/s, which may be any option
accepted by the <strong>complete</strong> builtin with the exception of <strong>-p</strong> and
<strong>-r</strong>, and write the matches to the standard output. When using the
<strong>-F</strong> or <strong>-C</strong> options, the various shell variables set by the
programmable completion facilities, while available, will not have
useful values.

The matches will be generated in the same way as if the programmable
completion code had generated them directly from a completion
specification with the same flags. If <em>word</em> is specified, only those
completions matching <em>word</em> will be displayed.

The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, or no

<p>Specify how arguments to each <em>name</em> should be completed. If the <strong>-p</strong>
option is supplied, or if no options are supplied, existing completion
specifications are printed in a way that allows them to be reused as
input. The <strong>-r</strong> option removes a completion specification for each
<em>name</em>, or, if no /name/s are supplied, all completion specifications.
The <strong>-D</strong> option indicates that other supplied options and actions should
apply to the ``default&#39;&#39; command completion; that is, completion
attempted on a command for which no completion has previously been
defined. The <strong>-E</strong> option indicates that other supplied options and
actions should apply to ``empty&#39;&#39; command completion; that is,
completion attempted on a blank line. The <strong>-I</strong> option indicates that
other supplied options and actions should apply to completion on the
initial non-assignment word on the line, or after a command delimiter
such as <strong>;</strong> or <strong>|</strong>, which is usually command name completion. If
multiple options are supplied, the <strong>-D</strong> option takes precedence over
<strong>-E</strong>, and both take precedence over <strong>-I</strong>. If any of <strong>-D</strong>, <strong>-E</strong>, or <strong>-I</strong>
are supplied, any other <em>name</em> arguments are ignored; these completions
only apply to the case specified by the option.</p>

The process of applying these completion specifications when word
completion is attempted is described</p>

Other options, if specified, have the following meanings. The arguments

attributes and values of each <em>name</em>. When <strong>-p</strong> is used with <em>name</em>
arguments, additional options, other than <strong>-f</strong> and <strong>-F</strong>, are ignored.
When <strong>-p</strong> is supplied without <em>name</em> arguments, it will display the
attributes and values of all variables having the attributes specified
by the additional options. If no other options are supplied with <strong>-p</strong>,
<strong>declare</strong> will display the attributes and values of all shell variables.
The <strong>-f</strong> option will restrict the display to shell functions. The <strong>-F</strong>
option inhibits the display of function definitions; only the function
name and attributes are printed. If the <strong>extdebug</strong> shell option is
enabled using <strong>shopt</strong>, the source file name and line number where each
<em>name</em> is defined are displayed as well. The <strong>-F</strong> option implies <strong>-f</strong>.
The <strong>-g</strong> option forces variables to be created or modified at the global
scope, even when <strong>declare</strong> is executed in a shell function. It is
ignored in all other cases. The <strong>-I</strong> option causes local variables to
inherit the attributes (except the <em>nameref</em> attribute) and value of any
existing variable with the same <em>name</em> at a surrounding scope. If there
is no existing variable, the local variable is initially unset. The
following options can be used to restrict output to variables with the

reference to another variable. That other variable is defined by the
value of <em>name</em>. All references, assignments, and attribute
modifications to <em>name</em>, except those using or changing the <strong>-n</strong>
attribute itself, are performed on the variable referenced by <em>name</em>&#39;s
value. The nameref attribute cannot be applied to array variables.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-r</strong>

<p>Using `+&#39; instead of `-&#39; turns off the attribute instead, with the
exceptions that <strong>+a</strong> and <strong>+A</strong> may not be used to destroy array variables
and <strong>+r</strong> will not remove the readonly attribute. When used in a
function, <strong>declare</strong> and <strong>typeset</strong> make each <em>name</em> local, as with the
<strong>local</strong> command, unless the <strong>-g</strong> option is supplied. If a variable name
is followed by =/value/, the value of the variable is set to <em>value</em>.
When using <strong>-a</strong> or <strong>-A</strong> and the compound assignment syntax to create
array variables, additional attributes do not take effect until
subsequent assignments. The return value is 0 unless an invalid option
is encountered, an attempt is made to define a function using ``-f

<dd>Enable and
disable builtin shell commands. Disabling a builtin allows a disk
command which has the same name as a shell builtin to be executed
without specifying a full pathname, even though the shell normally
searches for builtins before disk commands. If <strong>-n</strong> is used, each
<em>name</em> is disabled; otherwise, <em>names</em> are enabled. For example, to
use the <strong>test</strong> binary found via the</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>PATH</strong> instead of the shell builtin version, run ``enable -n test&#39;&#39;. The
<strong>-f</strong> option means to load the new builtin command <em>name</em> from shared
object <em>filename</em>, on systems that support dynamic loading. Bash will
use the value of the <strong>BASH_LOADABLES_PATH</strong> variable as a colon-separated
list of directories in which to search for <em>filename</em>. The default is
system-dependent. The <strong>-d</strong> option will delete a builtin previously
loaded with <strong>-f</strong>. If no <em>name</em> arguments are given, or if the <strong>-p</strong>
option is supplied, a list of shell builtins is printed. With no other
option arguments, the list consists of all enabled shell builtins. If
<strong>-n</strong> is supplied, only disabled builtins are printed. If <strong>-a</strong> is
supplied, the list printed includes all builtins, with an indication of
whether or not each is enabled. If <strong>-s</strong> is supplied, the output is
restricted to the POSIX <em>special</em> builtins. If no options are supplied
and a <em>name</em> is not a shell builtin, <strong>enable</strong> will attempt to load
<em>name</em> from a shared object named <em>name</em>, as if the command were
``enable -f <em>name name</em> . The return value is 0 unless a <em>name</em> is not a
shell builtin or there is an error loading a new builtin from a shared

<dt>
<strong>exec</strong> [*-cl*] [*-a* <em>name/] [/command</em> [/arguments/]]
</dt>
<dd>If <em>command</em>
is specified, it replaces the shell. No new process is created. The

supplied, the shell places a dash at the beginning of the zeroth
argument passed to <em>command</em>. This is what <em>login/(1) does. The <strong>-c</strong>
option causes /command</em> to be executed with an empty environment. If
<strong>-a</strong> is supplied, the shell passes <em>name</em> as the zeroth argument to
the executed command. If <em>command</em> cannot be executed for some reason,
a non-interactive shell exits, unless the <strong>execfail</strong> shell option is
enabled. In that case, it returns failure. An interactive shell
returns failure if the file cannot be executed. A subshell exits
unconditionally if <strong>exec</strong> fails. If <em>command</em> is not specified, any
redirections take effect in the current shell, and the return status
is 0. If there is a redirection error, the return status is 1.</dd>

option is supplied, a list of names of all exported variables is
printed. The <strong>-n</strong> option causes the export property to be removed from
each <em>name</em>. If a variable name is followed by =/word/, the value of the
variable is set to <em>word</em>. <strong>export</strong> returns an exit status of 0 unless
an invalid option is encountered, one of the <em>names</em> is not a valid

<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>The first form selects a range of commands from <em>first</em> to <em>last</em> from
the history list and displays or edits and re-executes them. <em>First</em> and
<em>last</em> may be specified as a string (to locate the last command
beginning with that string) or as a number (an index into the history
list, where a negative number is used as an offset from the current
command number). When listing, a <em>first</em> or <em>last</em> of 0 is equivalent to
-1 and -0 is equivalent to the current command (usually the <strong>fc</strong>
command); otherwise 0 is equivalent to -1 and -0 is invalid. If <em>last</em>
is not specified, it is set to the current command for listing (so that
``fc -l -10&#39;&#39; prints the last 10 commands) and to <em>first</em> otherwise. If
<em>first</em> is not specified, it is set to the previous command for editing
and -16 for listing.</p>
<p>
The <strong>-n</strong> option suppresses the command numbers when listing. The <strong>-r</strong>
option reverses the order of the commands. If the <strong>-l</strong> option is given,
the commands are listed on standard output. Otherwise, the editor given
by <em>ename</em> is invoked on a file containing those commands. If <em>ename</em> is
not given, the value of the</p>
<p>
<strong>FCEDIT</strong> variable is used, and the value of</p>
<p>
<strong>EDITOR</strong> if</p>
<p>
<strong>FCEDIT</strong> is not set. If neither variable is set, / vi / is used. When
editing is complete, the edited commands are echoed and executed.</p>
<p>
In the second form, <em>command</em> is re-executed after each instance of
<em>pat</em> is replaced by <em>rep</em>. <em>Command</em> is interpreted the same as <em>first</em>
above. A useful alias to use with this is ``r=&#34;fc -s&#34;&#39;&#39;, so that typing
``r cc&#39;&#39; runs the last command beginning with ``cc&#39;&#39; and typing ``r&#39;&#39;
re-executes the last command.</p>
<p>
If the first form is used, the return value is 0 unless an invalid
option is encountered or <em>first</em> or <em>last</em> specify history lines out of
range. If the <strong>-e</strong> option is supplied, the return value is the value of
the last command executed or failure if an error occurs with the
temporary file of commands. If the second form is used, the return
status is that of the command re-executed, unless <em>cmd</em> does not specify
a valid history line, in which case <strong>fc</strong> returns failure.</p>

<strong>fg</strong> [/jobspec/]
</dt>
<dd>Resume <em>jobspec</em> in the foreground, and make it
the current job. If <em>jobspec</em> is not present, the shell&#39;s notion of
the <em>current job</em> is used. The return value is that of the command
placed into the foreground, or failure if run when job control is
disabled or, when run with job control enabled, if <em>jobspec</em> does not
specify a valid job or <em>jobspec</em> specifies a job that was started
without job control.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>getopts</strong> <em>optstring</em> <em>name</em> [/arg …/]
</dt>
<dd><strong>getopts</strong> is used by shell
procedures to parse positional parameters. <em>optstring</em> contains the
option characters to be recognized; if a character is followed by a
colon, the option is expected to have an argument, which should be
separated from it by white space. The colon and question mark
characters may not be used as option characters. Each time it is
invoked, <strong>getopts</strong> places the next option in the shell variable
<em>name</em>, initializing <em>name</em> if it does not exist, and the index of the
next argument to be processed into the variable</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>OPTIND</strong>.</p>
<p>
<strong>OPTIND</strong> is initialized to 1 each time the shell or a shell script is
invoked. When an option requires an argument, <strong>getopts</strong> places that
argument into the variable</p>
<p>
<strong>OPTARG</strong>. The shell does not reset</p>
<p>
<strong>OPTIND</strong> automatically; it must be manually reset between multiple calls
to <strong>getopts</strong> within the same shell invocation if a new set of parameters
is to be used.</p>
<p>
When the end of options is encountered, <strong>getopts</strong> exits with a return
value greater than zero.</p>
<p>
<strong>OPTIND</strong> is set to the index of the first non-option argument, and
<em>name</em> is set to ?.</p>
<p>
<strong>getopts</strong> normally parses the positional parameters, but if more
arguments are supplied as <em>arg</em> values, <strong>getopts</strong> parses those instead.</p>
<p>
<strong>getopts</strong> can report errors in two ways. If the first character of
<em>optstring</em> is a colon, <em>silent</em> error reporting is used. In normal
operation, diagnostic messages are printed when invalid options or
missing option arguments are encountered. If the variable</p>
<p>
<strong>OPTERR</strong> is set to 0, no error messages will be displayed, even if the
first character of <em>optstring</em> is not a colon.</p>
<p>
If an invalid option is seen, <strong>getopts</strong> places ? into <em>name</em> and, if not
silent, prints an error message and unsets</p>
<p>
<strong>OPTARG</strong>. If <strong>getopts</strong> is silent, the option character found is placed
in</p>
<p>
<strong>OPTARG</strong> and no diagnostic message is printed.</p>
<p>
If a required argument is not found, and <strong>getopts</strong> is not silent, a
question mark ( <strong>?</strong> ) is placed in <em>name</em>,</p>
<p>
<strong>OPTARG</strong> is unset, and a diagnostic message is printed. If <strong>getopts</strong> is
silent, then a colon ( <strong>:</strong> ) is placed in <em>name</em> and</p>
<p>
<strong>OPTARG</strong> is set to the option character found.</p>
<p>
<strong>getopts</strong> returns true if an option, specified or unspecified, is found.
It returns false if the end of options is encountered or an error
occurs.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>hash</strong> [*-lr*] [*-p* /filename/] [*-dt*] [/name/]
</dt>
<dd>Each time <strong>hash</strong>
is invoked, the full pathname of the command <em>name</em> is determined by
searching the directories in <strong>$PATH</strong> and remembered. Any
previously-remembered pathname is discarded. If the <strong>-p</strong> option is
supplied, no path search is performed, and <em>filename</em> is used as the
full filename of the command. The <strong>-r</strong> option causes the shell to
forget all remembered locations. The <strong>-d</strong> option causes the shell to
forget the remembered location of each <em>name</em>. If the <strong>-t</strong> option is
supplied, the full pathname to which each <em>name</em> corresponds is
printed. If multiple <em>name</em> arguments are supplied with <strong>-t</strong>, the
<em>name</em> is printed before the hashed full pathname. The <strong>-l</strong> option
causes output to be displayed in a format that may be reused as input.
If no arguments are given, or if only <strong>-l</strong> is supplied, information
about remembered commands is printed. The return status is true unless
a <em>name</em> is not found or an invalid option is supplied.</dd>

Arguments, if supplied, have the following meanings:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-n</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Suppresses the normal change of directory when removing
directories from the stack, so that only the stack is manipulated.</dd>

<p>
Otherwise, <strong>popd</strong> returns false if an invalid option is encountered,
the directory stack is empty, or a non-existent directory stack entry

<strong>printf [-v */var/*] */format/</strong> [*/arguments/*]*

<p>Write the
formatted /arguments/* to the standard output under the* control of
the /format/*.* The <strong>-v option causes the output to be assigned to the
variable</strong> /var/* rather than being printed to the standard output.*</p>
<p>
The /format/* is a character string which contains three types of
objects:* plain characters, which are simply copied to standard
output, character escape sequences, which are converted and copied to
the standard output, and format specifications, each of which causes
printing of the next successive /argument/*.* In addition to the
standard /printf/*(1) format specifications,* <strong>printf interprets the
following extensions:</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>%b</strong>
</dt>
<dd>causes <strong>printf to expand backslash escape sequences in the
corresponding</strong> <em>argument</em> in the same way as <strong>echo -e.</strong></dd>
<dt>
<strong>%q</strong>
</dt>
<dd>causes <strong>printf to output the corresponding</strong> /argument/* in a
format that can be reused as shell input.*</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%Q</strong>
</dt>
<dd>like *%q, but applies any supplied precision to the
*/argument/ before quoting it.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%(<em>datefmt</em></strong>)T**
</dt>
<dd>causes <strong>printf to output the date-time string
resulting from using</strong> /datefmt/* as a format string for
<strong>/strftime/*(3).</strong> The corresponding /argument/* is an integer
representing the number of* seconds since the epoch. Two special
argument values may be used: -1 represents the current time, and -2
represents the time the shell was invoked. If no argument is
specified, conversion behaves as if -1 had been given. This is an
exception to the usual <strong>printf behavior.</strong></dd>
</dl>
<p>The %b, %q, and %T directives all use the field width and precision
arguments from the format specification and write that many bytes from
(or use that wide a field for) the expanded argument, which usually
contains more characters than the original.</p>
<p>
Arguments to non-string format specifiers are treated as C constants,
except that a leading plus or minus sign is allowed, and if the
leading character is a single or double quote, the value is the ASCII
value of the following character.</p>
<p>
The /format/* is reused as necessary to consume all of the
<strong><em>arguments</em></strong>.* If the /format/* requires more <strong><em>arguments</em></strong> than are
supplied, the* extra format specifications behave as if a zero value
or null string, as appropriate, had been supplied. The return value is
zero on success, non-zero on failure.</p>

<p>After the stack has been modified, if the <strong>-n option was not</strong> supplied,
<strong>pushd uses the cd builtin to change to the</strong> directory at the top of the
stack. If the <strong>cd fails, pushd returns a non-zero value.</strong></p>
<p>
Otherwise, if no arguments are supplied, <strong>pushd</strong> returns 0 unless the
directory stack is empty. When rotating the directory stack, <strong>pushd</strong>
returns 0 unless the directory stack is empty or a non-existent

<p><strong>SIG</strong> prefix is optional.</p>
<p>
If a <em>sigspec</em> is</p>
<p>
<strong>EXIT</strong> (0) the command <em>arg</em> is executed on exit from the shell. If a

<p>
<strong>DEBUG</strong>, the command <em>arg</em> is executed before every /simple command/*,

<strong>SHELL GRAMMAR</strong> Refer to the description of the <strong>extdebug option to the</strong>
<strong>shopt builtin for details of its effect on the DEBUG trap.</strong> If a

script executed with the <strong>. or source builtins finishes executing.</strong></p>
<p>
If a <em>sigspec</em> is</p>
<p>
<strong>ERR</strong>, the command <em>arg</em> is executed whenever a pipeline (which may
consist of a single simple command), a list, or a compound command
returns a non-zero exit status, subject to the following conditions. The</p>
<p>
<strong>ERR</strong> trap is not executed if the failed command is part of the command
list immediately following a <strong>while</strong> or <strong>until</strong> keyword, part of the
test in an <em>if</em> statement, part of a command executed in a <strong>&amp;&amp;</strong> or <strong>||</strong>
list except the command following the final <strong>&amp;&amp; or ||,</strong> any command in a
pipeline but the last, or if the command&#39;s return value is being
inverted using <strong>!</strong>. These are the same conditions obeyed by the <strong>errexit
(-e) option.</strong></p>
<p>
Signals ignored upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped or reset.
Trapped signals that are not being ignored are reset to their original
values in a subshell or subshell environment when one is created. The
return status is false if any <em>sigspec</em> is invalid; otherwise <strong>trap</strong>
returns true.</p>

shell reserved word, function, builtin, or disk file, respectively. If

SHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-80" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Bash-4.0 introduced the concept of a /shell compatibility level/*,*
specified as a set of options to the shopt builtin ( <strong>compat31</strong>,
<strong>compat32</strong>, <strong>compat40</strong>, <strong>compat41</strong>, and so on). There is only one
current compatibility level – each option is mutually exclusive. The
compatibility level is intended to allow users to select behavior from
previous versions that is incompatible with newer versions while they
migrate scripts to use current features and behavior. It&#39;s intended to
be a temporary solution.</p>
<p>
This section does not mention behavior that is standard for a particular
version (e.g., setting <strong>compat32 means that quoting the rhs of the
regexp</strong> matching operator quotes special regexp characters in the word,
which is default behavior in bash-3.2 and subsequent versions).</p>
<p>
If a user enables, say, <strong>compat32, it may affect the behavior of other</strong>
compatibility levels up to and including the current compatibility
level. The idea is that each compatibility level controls behavior that
changed in that version of <strong>bash,</strong> but that behavior may have been
present in earlier versions. For instance, the change to use
locale-based comparisons with the <strong>[[</strong> command came in bash-4.1, and
earlier versions used ASCII-based comparisons, so enabling <strong>compat32
will enable ASCII-based comparisons as well.</strong> That granularity may not
be sufficient for all uses, and as a result users should employ
compatibility levels carefully. Read the documentation for a particular
feature to find out the current behavior.</p>
<p>
Bash-4.3 introduced a new shell variable:</p>
<p>
<strong>BASH_COMPAT</strong>. The value assigned to this variable (a decimal version
number like 4.2, or an integer corresponding to the <strong>compat*/NN/</strong>
option, like 42) determines the* compatibility level.</p>
<p>
Starting with bash-4.4, Bash has begun deprecating older compatibility
levels. Eventually, the options will be removed in favor of</p>
<p>
<strong>BASH_COMPAT</strong>.</p>
<p>
Bash-5.0 is the final version for which there will be an individual
shopt option for the previous version. Users should use</p>
<p>
<strong>BASH_COMPAT</strong> on bash-5.0 and later versions.</p>
<p>
The following table describes the behavior changes controlled by each
compatibility level setting. The <strong>compat*/NN/</strong> tag is used as shorthand
for setting the* compatibility level to /NN/* using one of the following
mechanisms.* For versions prior to bash-5.0, the compatibility level may
be set using the corresponding <strong>compat*/NN/</strong> shopt option.* For bash-4.3
and later versions, the</p>
<p>
<strong>BASH_COMPAT</strong> variable is preferred, and it is required for bash-5.1 and
later versions.</p>

BUGS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-86" class="outline-text-2">
<p>It&#39;s too big and too slow.</p>
<p>
There are some subtle differences between <strong>bash</strong> and traditional
versions of <strong>sh</strong>, mostly because of the</p>
<p>
<strong>POSIX</strong> specification.</p>
<p>
Aliases are confusing in some uses.</p>
<p>
Shell builtin commands and functions are not stoppable/restartable.</p>
<p>
Compound commands and command sequences of the form `a ; b ; c&#39; are not
handled gracefully when process suspension is attempted. When a process
is stopped, the shell immediately executes the next command in the
sequence. It suffices to place the sequence of commands between
parentheses to force it into a subshell, which may be stopped as a unit.</p>
<p>
Array variables may not (yet) be exported.</p>
<p>
There may be only one active coprocess at a time.</p>
