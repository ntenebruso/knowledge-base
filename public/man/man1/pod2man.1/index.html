DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>pod2man</strong> is a wrapper script around the Pod::Man module, using it to
generate <strong>roff input from POD source. The resulting *roff code is
suitable for display on a terminal using *nroff</strong> (1), normally via
<strong>man</strong> (1), or printing using <strong>troff</strong> (1).</p>
<p>
By default (on non-EBCDIC systems), <strong>pod2man</strong> outputs UTF-8 manual
pages. Its output should work with the <strong>man</strong> program on systems that use
<strong>groff</strong> (most Linux distributions) or <strong>mandoc</strong> (most BSD variants), but
may result in mangled output on older UNIX systems. To choose a
different, possibly more backward-compatible output mangling on such
systems, use <code class="verbatim">--encoding=roff</code> (the default in earlier Pod::Man
versions). See the <strong>–encoding</strong> option and &#34;ENCODING&#34; in Pod::Man for
more details.</p>
<p>
<em>input</em> is the file to read for POD source (the POD can be embedded in
code). If <em>input</em> isn&#39;t given, it defaults to <code class="verbatim">STDIN</code>. <em>output</em>, if
given, is the file to which to write the formatted output. If <em>output</em>
isn&#39;t given, the formatted output is written to <code class="verbatim">STDOUT</code>. Several POD
files can be processed in the same <strong>pod2man</strong> invocation (saving module
load and compile times) by providing multiple pairs of <em>input</em> and
<em>output</em> files on the command line.</p>
<p>
<strong>–section</strong>, <strong>–release</strong>, <strong>–center</strong>, <strong>–date</strong>, and <strong>–official</strong> can be
used to set the headers and footers to use. If not given, Pod::Man will
assume various defaults. See below for details.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Each option is annotated with the version of podlators in which that
option was added with its current meaning.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-c string, –center=string
</dt>
<dd>[1.00] Sets the centered page header for
the <code class="verbatim">.TH</code> macro to <em>string</em>. The default is
<code class="verbatim">User Contributed Perl Documentation</code>, but also see <strong>–official</strong>
below.</dd>
<dt>
-d string, –date=string
</dt>
<dd>[4.00] Set the left-hand footer string for
the <code class="verbatim">.TH</code> macro to <em>string</em>. By default, the first of POD_MAN_DATE,
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, the modification date of the input file, or the
current date (if input comes from <code class="verbatim">STDIN</code>) will be used, and the date
will be in UTC. See &#34;CLASS METHODS&#34; in Pod::Man for more details.</dd>
<dt>
-e encoding, –encoding=encoding
</dt>
<dd>[5.00] Specifies the encoding of
the output. <em>encoding</em> must be an encoding recognized by the Encode
module (see Encode::Supported). The default on non-EBCDIC systems is
UTF-8. If the output contains characters that cannot be represented in
this encoding, that is an error that will be reported as configured by
the <strong>–errors</strong> option. If error handling is other than <code class="verbatim">die</code>, the
unrepresentable character will be replaced with the Encode
substitution character (normally <code class="verbatim">?</code>). If the <code class="verbatim">encoding</code> option is set
to the special value <code class="verbatim">groff</code> (the default on EBCDIC systems), or if
the Encode module is not available and the encoding is set to anything
other than <code class="verbatim">roff</code> (see below), Pod::Man will translate all non-ASCII
characters to <code class="verbatim">\[uNNNN]</code> Unicode escapes. These are not traditionally
part of the <strong>roff language, but are supported by *groff</strong> and <strong>mandoc</strong>
and thus by the majority of manual page processors in use today. If
<em>encoding</em> is set to the special value <code class="verbatim">roff</code>, <strong>pod2man</strong> will do its
historic transformation of (some) ISO 8859-1 characters into *roff
escapes that may be adequate in troff and may be readable (if ugly) in
nroff. This was the default behavior of versions of <strong>pod2man</strong> before
5.00. With this encoding, all other non-ASCII characters will be
replaced with <code class="verbatim">X</code>. It may be required for very old troff and nroff
implementations that do not support UTF-8, but its representation of
any non-ASCII character is very poor and often specific to European
languages. Its use is discouraged. WARNING: The input encoding of the
POD source is independent from the output encoding, and setting this
option does not affect the interpretation of the POD input. Unless
your POD source is US-ASCII, its encoding should be declared with the
<code class="verbatim">=encoding</code> command in the source. If this is not done, Pod::Simple
will will attempt to guess the encoding and may be successful if it&#39;s
Latin-1 or UTF-8, but it will produce warnings. See <strong>perlpod</strong> (1) for
more information.</dd>
<dt>
–errors=style
</dt>
<dd>[2.5.0] Set the error handling style. <code class="verbatim">die</code> says to
throw an exception on any POD formatting error. <code class="verbatim">stderr</code> says to
report errors on standard error, but not to throw an exception. <code class="verbatim">pod</code>
says to include a POD ERRORS section in the resulting documentation
summarizing the errors. <code class="verbatim">none</code> ignores POD errors entirely, as much as
possible. The default is <code class="verbatim">die</code>.</dd>
<dt>
–fixed=font
</dt>
<dd>[1.0] The fixed-width font to use for verbatim text
and code. Defaults to <code class="verbatim">CW</code>. Some systems may want <code class="verbatim">CR</code> instead. Only
matters for <strong>troff</strong> output.</dd>
<dt>
–fixedbold=font
</dt>
<dd>[1.0] Bold version of the fixed-width font.
Defaults to <code class="verbatim">CB</code>. Only matters for <strong>troff</strong> output.</dd>
<dt>
–fixeditalic=font
</dt>
<dd>[1.0] Italic version of the fixed-width font
(something of a misnomer, since most fixed-width fonts only have an
oblique version, not an italic version). Defaults to <code class="verbatim">CI</code>. Only
matters for <strong>troff</strong> output.</dd>
<dt>
–fixedbolditalic=font
</dt>
<dd>[1.0] Bold italic (in theory, probably
oblique in practice) version of the fixed-width font. Pod::Man doesn&#39;t
assume you have this, and defaults to <code class="verbatim">CB</code>. Some systems (such as
Solaris) have this font available as <code class="verbatim">CX</code>. Only matters for <strong>troff</strong>
output.</dd>
<dt>
–guesswork=rule[,rule…]
</dt>
<dd>
<p>[5.00] By default, <strong>pod2man</strong> applies
some default formatting rules based on guesswork and regular
expressions that are intended to make writing Perl documentation
easier and require less explicit markup. These rules may not always be
appropriate, particularly for documentation that isn&#39;t about Perl.
This option allows turning all or some of it off. The special rule
<code class="verbatim">all</code> enables all guesswork. This is also the default for backward
compatibility reasons. The special rule <code class="verbatim">none</code> disables all guesswork.
Otherwise, the value of this option should be a comma-separated list
of one or more of the following keywords:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
functions
</dt>
<dd>Convert function references like <code class="verbatim">foo()</code> to bold even
if they have no markup. The function name accepts valid Perl
characters for function names (including <code class="verbatim">:</code>), and the trailing
parentheses must be present and empty.</dd>
<dt>
manref
</dt>
<dd>Make the first part (before the parentheses) of man page
references like <code class="verbatim">foo(1)</code> bold even if they have no markup. The
section must be a single number optionally followed by lowercase
letters.</dd>
<dt>
quoting
</dt>
<dd>If no guesswork is enabled, any text enclosed in C&lt;&gt; is
surrounded by double quotes in nroff (terminal) output unless the
contents are already quoted. When this guesswork is enabled, quote
marks will also be suppressed for Perl variables, function names,
function calls, numbers, and hex constants.</dd>
<dt>
variables
</dt>
<dd>Convert Perl variable names to a fixed-width font even
if they have no markup. This transformation will only be apparent in
troff output, or some other output format (unlike nroff terminal
output) that supports fixed-width fonts.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Any unknown guesswork name is silently ignored (for potential future
compatibility), so be careful about spelling.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-h, –help
</dt>
<dd>[1.00] Print out usage information.</dd>
<dt>
-l, –lax
</dt>
<dd>[1.00] No longer used. <strong>pod2man</strong> used to check its input
for validity as a manual page, but this should now be done by
<strong>podchecker</strong> (1) instead. Accepted for backward compatibility; this
option no longer does anything.</dd>
<dt>
–language=language
</dt>
<dd>[5.00] Add commands telling <strong>groff</strong> that the
input file is in the given language. The value of this setting must be
a language abbreviation for which <strong>groff</strong> provides supplemental
configuration, such as <code class="verbatim">ja</code> (for Japanese) or <code class="verbatim">zh</code> (for Chinese). This
adds: .mso &lt;language&gt;.tmac .hla &lt;language&gt; to the start of the file,
which configure correct line breaking for the specified language.
Without these commands, groff may not know how to add proper line
breaks for Chinese and Japanese text if the man page is installed into
the normal man page directory, such as <em>/usr/share/man</em>. On many
systems, this will be done automatically if the man page is installed
into a language-specific man page directory, such as
<em>/usr/share/man/zh_CN</em>. In that case, this option is not required.
Unfortunately, the commands added with this option are specific to
<strong>groff</strong> and will not work with other <strong>troff</strong> and <strong>nroff</strong>
implementations.</dd>
<dt>
–lquote=quote
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
–rquote=quote
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>[4.08] Sets the quote marks used to surround C&lt;&gt; text. <strong>–lquote</strong> sets
the left quote mark and <strong>–rquote</strong> sets the right quote mark. Either may
also be set to the special value <code class="verbatim">none</code>, in which case no quote mark is
added on that side of C&lt;&gt; text (but the font is still changed for troff
output). Also see the <strong>–quotes</strong> option, which can be used to set both
quotes at once. If both <strong>–quotes</strong> and one of the other options is set,
<strong>–lquote</strong> or <strong>–rquote</strong> overrides <strong>–quotes</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-n name, –name=name
</dt>
<dd>[4.08] Set the name of the manual page for the
<code class="verbatim">.TH</code> macro to <em>name</em>. Without this option, the manual name is set to
the uppercased base name of the file being converted unless the manual
section is 3, in which case the path is parsed to see if it is a Perl
module path. If it is, a path like <code class="verbatim">.../lib/Pod/Man.pm</code> is converted
into a name like <code class="verbatim">Pod::Man</code>. This option, if given, overrides any
automatic determination of the name. Although one does not have to
follow this convention, be aware that the convention for UNIX manual
pages is for the title to be in all-uppercase, even if the command
isn&#39;t. (Perl modules traditionally use mixed case for the manual page
title, however.) This option is probably not useful when converting
multiple POD files at once. When converting POD source from standard
input, the name will be set to <code class="verbatim">STDIN</code> if this option is not provided.
Providing this option is strongly recommended to set a meaningful
manual page name.</dd>
<dt>
–nourls
</dt>
<dd>[2.5.0] Normally, L&lt;&gt; formatting codes with a URL but
anchor text are formatted to show both the anchor text and the URL. In
other words: L&lt;foo|<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>&gt; is formatted as: foo
&lt;<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>&gt; This flag, if given, suppresses the URL when
anchor text is given, so this example would be formatted as just
<code class="verbatim">foo</code>. This can produce less cluttered output in cases where the URLs
are not particularly important.</dd>
<dt>
-o, –official
</dt>
<dd>[1.00] Set the default header to indicate that this
page is part of the standard Perl release, if <strong>–center</strong> is not also
given.</dd>
<dt>
-q quotes, –quotes=quotes
</dt>
<dd>[4.00] Sets the quote marks used to
surround C&lt;&gt; text to <em>quotes</em>. If <em>quotes</em> is a single character, it
is used as both the left and right quote. Otherwise, it is split in
half, and the first half of the string is used as the left quote and
the second is used as the right quote. <em>quotes</em> may also be set to the
special value <code class="verbatim">none</code>, in which case no quote marks are added around
C&lt;&gt; text (but the font is still changed for troff output). Also see
the <strong>–lquote</strong> and <strong>–rquote</strong> options, which can be used to set the
left and right quotes independently. If both <strong>–quotes</strong> and one of the
other options is set, <strong>–lquote</strong> or <strong>–rquote</strong> overrides <strong>–quotes</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-r version, –release=version
</dt>
<dd>[1.00] Set the centered footer for
the <code class="verbatim">.TH</code> macro to <em>version</em>. By default, this is set to the version
of Perl you run <strong>pod2man</strong> under. Setting this to the empty string will
cause some *roff implementations to use the system default value. Note
that some system <code class="verbatim">an</code> macro sets assume that the centered footer will
be a modification date and will prepend something like
=Last modified: =. If this is the case for your target system, you may
want to set <strong>–release</strong> to the last modified date and <strong>–date</strong> to the
version number.</dd>
<dt>
-s string, –section=string
</dt>
<dd>[1.00] Set the section for the <code class="verbatim">.TH</code>
macro. The standard section numbering convention is to use 1 for user
commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for functions, 4 for devices, 5 for
file formats, 6 for games, 7 for miscellaneous information, and 8 for
administrator commands. There is a lot of variation here, however;
some systems (like Solaris) use 4 for file formats, 5 for
miscellaneous information, and 7 for devices. Still others use 1m
instead of 8, or some mix of both. About the only section numbers that
are reliably consistent are 1, 2, and 3. By default, section 1 will be
used unless the file ends in <code class="verbatim">.pm</code>, in which case section 3 will be
selected.</dd>
<dt>
–stderr
</dt>
<dd>[2.1.3] By default, <strong>pod2man</strong> dies if any errors are
detected in the POD input. If <strong>–stderr</strong> is given and no <strong>–errors</strong>
flag is present, errors are sent to standard error, but <strong>pod2man</strong> does
not abort. This is equivalent to <code class="verbatim">--errors=stderr</code> and is supported
for backward compatibility.</dd>
<dt>
-u, –utf8
</dt>
<dd>[2.1.0] This option used to tell <strong>pod2man</strong> to produce
UTF-8 output. Since this is now the default as of version 5.00, it is
ignored and does nothing.</dd>
<dt>
-v, –verbose
</dt>
<dd>[1.11] Print out the name of each output file as it
is being generated.</dd>
