DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>Less</strong> is a program similar to <strong>more*(1), but it has many more features.
*Less</strong> does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so
with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like
<strong>vi*(1). *Less</strong> uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can
run on a variety of terminals. There is even limited support for
hardcopy terminals. (On a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be
printed at the top of the screen are prefixed with a caret.)</p>
<p>
Commands are based on both <strong>more</strong> and <strong>vi</strong>. Commands may be preceded by
a decimal number, called N in the descriptions below. The number is used
by some commands, as indicated.</p>
</div>

COMMANDS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>In the following descriptions, ^X means control-X. ESC stands for the
ESCAPE key; for example ESC-v means the two character sequence &#34;ESCAPE&#34;,
then &#34;v&#34;.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
h or H
</dt>
<dd>Help: display a summary of these commands. If you forget all
the other commands, remember this one.</dd>
<dt>
SPACE or ^V or f or ^F
</dt>
<dd>Scroll forward N lines, default one window
(see option -z below). If N is more than the screen size, only the
final screenful is displayed. Warning: some systems use ^V as a
special literalization character.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li value="26">Like SPACE, but if N is specified, it becomes the new window
size.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>
ESC-SPACE
</dt>
<dd>Like SPACE, but scrolls a full screenful, even if it
reaches end-of-file in the process.</dd>
<dt>
ENTER or RETURN or ^N or e or ^E or j or ^J
</dt>
<dd>Scroll forward N lines,
default 1. The entire N lines are displayed, even if N is more than
the screen size.</dd>
<dt>
d or ^D
</dt>
<dd>Scroll forward N lines, default one half of the screen
size. If N is specified, it becomes the new default for subsequent d
and u commands.</dd>
<dt>
b or ^B or ESC-v
</dt>
<dd>Scroll backward N lines, default one window (see
option -z below). If N is more than the screen size, only the final
screenful is displayed.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li value="23">Like ESC-v, but if N is specified, it becomes the new window
size.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>
y or ^Y or ^P or k or ^K
</dt>
<dd>Scroll backward N lines, default 1. The
entire N lines are displayed, even if N is more than the screen size.
Warning: some systems use ^Y as a special job control character.</dd>
<dt>
u or ^U
</dt>
<dd>Scroll backward N lines, default one half of the screen
size. If N is specified, it becomes the new default for subsequent d
and u commands.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li value="10">Like j, but continues to scroll beyond the end of the file.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>
K or Y
</dt>
<dd>Like k, but continues to scroll beyond the beginning of the
file.</dd>
<dt>
ESC-) or RIGHTARROW
</dt>
<dd>Scroll horizontally right N characters, default
half the screen width (see the -# option). If a number N is specified,
it becomes the default for future RIGHTARROW and LEFTARROW commands.
While the text is scrolled, it acts as though the -S option (chop
lines) were in effect.</dd>
<dt>
ESC-( or LEFTARROW
</dt>
<dd>Scroll horizontally left N characters, default
half the screen width (see the -# option). If a number N is specified,
it becomes the default for future RIGHTARROW and LEFTARROW commands.</dd>
<dt>
ESC-} or ^RIGHTARROW
</dt>
<dd>Scroll horizontally right to show the end of
the longest displayed line.</dd>
<dt>
ESC-{ or ^LEFTARROW
</dt>
<dd>Scroll horizontally left back to the first
column.</dd>
<dt>
r or ^R or ^L
</dt>
<dd>Repaint the screen.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li value="18">Repaint the screen, discarding any buffered input. That is,
reload the current file. Useful if the file is changing while it is
being viewed.</li>
<li>Scroll forward, and keep trying to read when the end of file is
reached. Normally this command would be used when already at the end
of the file. It is a way to monitor the tail of a file which is
growing while it is being viewed. (The behavior is similar to the
&#34;tail -f&#34; command.) To stop waiting for more data, enter the
interrupt character (usually ^C). On systems which support *poll*(2)
you can also use ^X or the character specified by the –intr option.
If the input is a pipe and the –exit-follow-on-close option is in
effect, <strong>less</strong> will automatically stop waiting for data when the
input side of the pipe is closed.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>
ESC-F
</dt>
<dd>Like F, but as soon as a line is found which matches the last
search pattern, the terminal bell is rung and forward scrolling stops.</dd>
<dt>
g or &lt; or ESC-&lt;
</dt>
<dd>Go to line N in the file, default 1 (beginning of
file). (Warning: this may be slow if N is large.)</dd>
<dt>
G or &gt; or ESC-&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Go to line N in the file, default the end of the
file. (Warning: this may be slow if N is large, or if N is not
specified and standard input, rather than a file, is being read.)</dd>
<dt>
ESC-G
</dt>
<dd>Same as G, except if no number N is specified and the input
is standard input, goes to the last line which is currently buffered.</dd>
<dt>
p or %
</dt>
<dd>Go to a position N percent into the file. N should be
between 0 and 100, and may contain a decimal point.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li value="16">Go to the line containing byte offset N in the file.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>
{
</dt>
<dd>If a left curly bracket appears in the top line displayed on the
screen, the { command will go to the matching right curly bracket. The
matching right curly bracket is positioned on the bottom line of the
screen. If there is more than one left curly bracket on the top line,
a number N may be used to specify the N-th bracket on the line.</dd>
<dt>
}
</dt>
<dd>If a right curly bracket appears in the bottom line displayed on
the screen, the } command will go to the matching left curly bracket.
The matching left curly bracket is positioned on the top line of the
screen. If there is more than one right curly bracket on the bottom
line, a number N may be used to specify the N-th bracket on the line.</dd>
<dt>
(
</dt>
<dd>Like {, but applies to parentheses rather than curly brackets.</dd>
<dt>
)
</dt>
<dd>Like }, but applies to parentheses rather than curly brackets.</dd>
<dt>
[
</dt>
<dd>Like {, but applies to square brackets rather than curly
brackets.</dd>
<dt>
]
</dt>
<dd>Like }, but applies to square brackets rather than curly
brackets.</dd>
<dt>
ESC-^F
</dt>
<dd>Followed by two characters, acts like {, but uses the two
characters as open and close brackets, respectively. For example, &#34;ESC
^F &lt; &gt;&#34; could be used to go forward to the &gt; which matches the &lt; in
the top displayed line.</dd>
<dt>
ESC-^B
</dt>
<dd>Followed by two characters, acts like }, but uses the two
characters as open and close brackets, respectively. For example, &#34;ESC
^B &lt; &gt;&#34; could be used to go backward to the &lt; which matches the &gt; in
the bottom displayed line.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li value="13">Followed by any lowercase or uppercase letter, marks the first
displayed line with that letter. If the status column is enabled via
the -J option, the status column shows the marked line.</li>
<li value="13">Acts like m, except the last displayed line is marked rather
than the first displayed line.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>
&#39;
</dt>
<dd>(Single quote.) Followed by any lowercase or uppercase letter,
returns to the position which was previously marked with that letter.
Followed by another single quote, returns to the position at which the
last &#34;large&#34; movement command was executed. Followed by a ^ or $,
jumps to the beginning or end of the file respectively. Marks are
preserved when a new file is examined, so the &#39; command can be used to
switch between input files.</dd>
<dt>
^X^X
</dt>
<dd>Same as single quote.</dd>
<dt>
ESC-m
</dt>
<dd>Followed by any lowercase or uppercase letter, clears the
mark identified by that letter.</dd>
<dt>
/pattern
</dt>
<dd>Search forward in the file for the N-th line containing
the pattern. N defaults to 1. The pattern is a regular expression, as
recognized by the regular expression library supplied by your system.
By default, searching is case-sensitive (uppercase and lowercase are
considered different); the -i option can be used to change this. The
search starts at the first line displayed (but see the -a and -j
options, which change this).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Certain characters are special if entered at the beginning of the
pattern; they modify the type of search rather than become part of the
pattern:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
^N or !
</dt>
<dd>Search for lines which do NOT match the pattern.</dd>
<dt>
^E or *
</dt>
<dd>Search multiple files. That is, if the search reaches the
END of the current file without finding a match, the search continues
in the next file in the command line list.</dd>
<dt>
^F or @
</dt>
<dd>Begin the search at the first line of the FIRST file in the
command line list, regardless of what is currently displayed on the
screen or the settings of the -a or -j options.</dd>
<dt>
^K
</dt>
<dd>Highlight any text which matches the pattern on the current
screen, but don&#39;t move to the first match (KEEP current position).</dd>
<dt>
^R
</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t interpret regular expression metacharacters; that is, do a
simple textual comparison.</dd>
<dt>
^S
</dt>
<dd>Followed by a digit N between 1 and 5. Only text which has a
non-empty match for the N-th parenthesized SUB-PATTERN will be
considered to match the pattern. (Supported only if <strong>less</strong> is built
with one of the regular expression libraries <strong>posix</strong>, <strong>pcre</strong>, or
<strong>pcre2</strong>.) Multiple ^S modifiers can be specified, to match more than
one sub-pattern.</dd>
<dt>
^W
</dt>
<dd>WRAP around the current file. That is, if the search reaches the
end of the current file without finding a match, the search continues
from the first line of the current file up to the line where it
started. If the ^W modifier is set, the ^E modifier is ignored.</dd>
<dt>
^L
</dt>
<dd>The next character is taken literally; that is, it becomes part
of the pattern even if it is one of the above search modifier
characters.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
?pattern
</dt>
<dd>Search backward in the file for the N-th line containing
the pattern. The search starts at the last line displayed (but see the
-a and -j options, which change this).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Certain characters are special as in the / command:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
^N or !
</dt>
<dd>Search for lines which do NOT match the pattern.</dd>
<dt>
^E or *
</dt>
<dd>Search multiple files. That is, if the search reaches the
beginning of the current file without finding a match, the search
continues in the previous file in the command line list.</dd>
<dt>
^F or @
</dt>
<dd>Begin the search at the last line of the last file in the
command line list, regardless of what is currently displayed on the
screen or the settings of the -a or -j options.</dd>
<dt>
^K
</dt>
<dd>As in forward searches.</dd>
<dt>
^R
</dt>
<dd>As in forward searches.</dd>
<dt>
^S
</dt>
<dd>As in forward searches.</dd>
<dt>
^W
</dt>
<dd>WRAP around the current file. That is, if the search reaches the
beginning of the current file without finding a match, the search
continues from the last line of the current file up to the line where
it started.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
ESC-/pattern
</dt>
<dd>Same as &#34;/*&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
ESC-?pattern
</dt>
<dd>Same as &#34;?*&#34;.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li value="14">Repeat previous search, for N-th line containing the last
pattern. If the previous search was modified by ^N, the search is
made for the N-th line NOT containing the pattern. If the previous
search was modified by ^E, the search continues in the next (or
previous) file if not satisfied in the current file. If the previous
search was modified by ^R, the search is done without using regular
expressions. There is no effect if the previous search was modified
by ^F or ^K.</li>
<li value="14">Repeat previous search, but in the reverse direction.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>
ESC-n
</dt>
<dd>Repeat previous search, but crossing file boundaries. The
effect is as if the previous search were modified by *.</dd>
<dt>
ESC-N
</dt>
<dd>Repeat previous search, but in the reverse direction and
crossing file boundaries.</dd>
<dt>
ESC-u
</dt>
<dd>Undo search highlighting. Turn off highlighting of strings
matching the current search pattern. If highlighting is already off
because of a previous ESC-u command, turn highlighting back on. Any
search command will also turn highlighting back on. (Highlighting can
also be disabled by toggling the -G option; in that case search
commands do not turn highlighting back on.)</dd>
<dt>
ESC-U
</dt>
<dd>Like ESC-u but also clears the saved search pattern. If the
status column is enabled via the -J option, this clears all search
matches marked in the status column.</dd>
<dt>
&amp;pattern
</dt>
<dd>Display only lines which match the pattern; lines which do
not match the pattern are not displayed. If pattern is empty (if you
type &amp; immediately followed by ENTER), any filtering is turned off,
and all lines are displayed. While filtering is in effect, an
ampersand is displayed at the beginning of the prompt, as a reminder
that some lines in the file may be hidden. Multiple &amp; commands may be
entered, in which case only lines which match all of the patterns will
be displayed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Certain characters are special as in the / command:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
^N or !
</dt>
<dd>Display only lines which do NOT match the pattern.</dd>
<dt>
^R
</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t interpret regular expression metacharacters; that is, do a
simple textual comparison.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
:e [filename]
</dt>
<dd>Examine a new file. If the filename is missing, the
&#34;current&#34; file (see the :n and :p commands below) from the list of
files in the command line is re-examined. A percent sign (%) in the
filename is replaced by the name of the current file. A pound sign (#)
is replaced by the name of the previously examined file. However, two
consecutive percent signs are simply replaced with a single percent
sign. This allows you to enter a filename that contains a percent sign
in the name. Similarly, two consecutive pound signs are replaced with
a single pound sign. The filename is inserted into the command line
list of files so that it can be seen by subsequent :n and :p commands.
If the filename consists of several files, they are all inserted into
the list of files and the first one is examined. If the filename
contains one or more spaces, the entire filename should be enclosed in
double quotes (also see the -&#34; option).</dd>
<dt>
^X^V or E
</dt>
<dd>Same as :e. Warning: some systems use ^V as a special
literalization character. On such systems, you may not be able to use
^V.</dd>
<dt>
:n
</dt>
<dd>Examine the next file (from the list of files given in the
command line). If a number N is specified, the N-th next file is
examined.</dd>
<dt>
:p
</dt>
<dd>Examine the previous file in the command line list. If a number
N is specified, the N-th previous file is examined.</dd>
<dt>
:x
</dt>
<dd>Examine the first file in the command line list. If a number N
is specified, the N-th file in the list is examined.</dd>
<dt>
:d
</dt>
<dd>Remove the current file from the list of files.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li value="20">Go to the next tag, if there were more than one matches for
the current tag. See the -t option for more details about tags.</li>
<li value="20">Go to the previous tag, if there were more than one matches
for the current tag.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>
^O^N or ^On
</dt>
<dd>Search forward in the file for the N-th next OSC 8
hyperlink.</dd>
<dt>
^O^P or ^Op
</dt>
<dd>Search backward in the file for the N-th previous OSC 8
hyperlink.</dd>
<dt>
^O^L or ^Ol
</dt>
<dd>Jump to the currently selected OSC 8 hyperlink.</dd>
<dt>
= or ^G or :f
</dt>
<dd>Prints some information about the file being viewed,
including its name and the line number and byte offset of the bottom
line being displayed. If possible, it also prints the length of the
file, the number of lines in the file and the percent of the file
above the last displayed line.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd>Followed by one of the command line option letters (see OPTIONS
below), this will change the setting of that option and print a
message describing the new setting. If a ^P (CONTROL-P) is entered
immediately after the dash, the setting of the option is changed but
no message is printed. If the option letter has a numeric value (such
as -b or -h), or a string value (such as -P or -t), a new value may be
entered after the option letter. If no new value is entered, a message
describing the current setting is printed and nothing is changed.</dd>
<dt>
–
</dt>
<dd>Like the - command, but takes a long option name (see OPTIONS
below) rather than a single option letter. You must press ENTER or
RETURN after typing the option name. A ^P immediately after the second
dash suppresses printing of a message describing the new setting, as
in the - command.</dd>
<dt>
-+
</dt>
<dd>Followed by one of the command line option letters this will
reset the option to its default setting and print a message describing
the new setting. (The &#34;-+/X/&#34; command does the same thing as &#34;-+/X/&#34;
on the command line.) This does not work for string-valued options.</dd>
<dt>
–+
</dt>
<dd>Like the -+ command, but takes a long option name rather than a
single option letter.</dd>
<dt>
-!
</dt>
<dd>Followed by one of the command line option letters, this will
reset the option to the &#34;opposite&#34; of its default setting and print a
message describing the new setting. This does not work for numeric or
string-valued options.</dd>
<dt>
–!
</dt>
<dd>Like the -! command, but takes a long option name rather than a
single option letter.</dd>
<dt>
_
</dt>
<dd>(Underscore.) Followed by one of the command line option letters,
this will print a message describing the current setting of that
option. The setting of the option is not changed.</dd>
<dt>
__
</dt>
<dd>(Double underscore.) Like the _ (underscore) command, but takes
a long option name rather than a single option letter. You must press
ENTER or RETURN after typing the option name.</dd>
<dt>
+cmd
</dt>
<dd>Causes the specified cmd to be executed each time a new file
is examined. For example, +G causes <strong>less</strong> to initially display each
file starting at the end rather than the beginning.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li value="22">Prints the version number of <strong>less</strong> being run.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>
q or Q or :q or :Q or ZZ
</dt>
<dd>Exits <strong>less</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following seven commands may or may not be valid, depending on your
particular installation.</p>
<ol>
<li value="22">Invokes an editor to edit the current file being viewed. The
editor is taken from the environment variable VISUAL if defined, or
EDITOR if VISUAL is not defined, or defaults to &#34;vi&#34; if neither
VISUAL nor EDITOR is defined. See also the discussion of LESSEDIT
under the section on PROMPTS below.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>
! shell-command
</dt>
<dd>Invokes a shell to run the shell-command given. A
percent sign (%) in the command is replaced by the name of the current
file. A pound sign (#) is replaced by the name of the previously
examined file. &#34;!!&#34; repeats the last shell command. &#34;!&#34; with no shell
command simply invokes a shell. If a ^P (CONTROL-P) is entered
immediately after the !, no &#34;done&#34; message is printed after the shell
command is executed. On Unix systems, the shell is taken from the
environment variable SHELL, or defaults to &#34;sh&#34;. On MS-DOS, Windows,
and OS/2 systems, the shell is the normal command processor.</dd>
<dt>
# shell-command
</dt>
<dd>Similar to the &#34;!&#34; command, except that the command
is expanded in the same way as prompt strings. For example, the name
of the current file would be given as &#34;%f&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
| &lt;m&gt; shell-command
</dt>
<dd>&lt;m&gt; represents any mark letter. Pipes a section
of the input file to the given shell command. The section of the file
to be piped is between the position marked by the letter and the
current screen. The entire current screen is included, regardless of
whether the marked position is before or after the current screen. &lt;m&gt;
may also be ^ or $ to indicate beginning or end of file respectively.
If &lt;m&gt; is . or newline, the current screen is piped. If a ^P
(CONTROL-P) is entered immediately after the mark letter, no &#34;done&#34;
message is printed after the shell command is executed.</dd>
<dt>
s filename
</dt>
<dd>Save the input to a file. This works only if the input
is a pipe, not an ordinary file.</dd>
<dt>
^O^O
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Run a shell command to open the URI in the current OSC 8 hyperlink,
selected by a previous ^O^N or ^O^P command. To find the shell
command, the environment variable named &#34;LESS_OSC8_xxx&#34; is read, where
&#34;xxx&#34; is the scheme from the URI (the part before the first colon), or
is empty if there is no colon in the URI. The value of the environment
variable is then expanded in the same way as prompt strings (in
particular, any instance of &#34;%o&#34; is replaced with the URI) to produce
an OSC 8 &#34;handler&#34; shell command. The standard output from the handler
is an &#34;opener&#34; shell command which is then executed to open the URI.</p>
<p>
There are two special cases:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>If the URI begins with &#34;#&#34;, the remainder of the URI is taken to be
the value of the id parameter in another OSC 8 link in the same
file, and ^O^O will simply jump to that link.</li>
<li>If the opener begins with the characters &#34;:e&#34; followed by
whitespace and a filename, then instead of running the opener as a
shell command, the specified filename is opened in the current
instance of <strong>less</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
In a simple case where the opener accepts the complete URI as a
command line parameter, the handler may be as simple as</p>
<pre class="example">
echo mybrowser &#39;%o&#39;
</pre>
<p>
In other cases, the URI may need to be modified, so the handler may
have to do some manipulation of the %o value.</p>
<p>
If the LESS_OSC8_xxx variable is not set, the variable LESS_OSC8_ANY
is tried. If neither LESS_OSC8_xxx nor LESS_OSC8_ANY is set, links
using the &#34;xxx&#34; scheme cannot be opened. However, there are default
handlers for the schemes &#34;man&#34; (used when LESS_OSC8_man is not set)
and &#34;file&#34; (used when LESS_OSC8_file is not set), which should work on
systems which provide the *sed*(1) command and a shell with syntax
compatible with the Bourne shell *sh*(1). If you use LESS_OSC8_ANY to
override LESS_OSC8_file, you must set LESS_OSC8_file to &#34;-&#34; to
indicate that the default value should not be used, and likewise for
LESS_OSC8_man.</p>
<p>
The URI passed to an OSC8 handler via %o is guaranteed not to contain
any single quote or double quote characters, but it may contain any
other shell metacharacters such as semicolons, dollar signs,
ampersands, etc. The handler should take care to appropriately quote
parameters in the opener command, to prevent execution of unintended
shell commands in the case of opening a URI which contains shell
metacharacters. Also, since the handler command is expanded like a
command prompt, any metacharacters interpreted by prompt expansion
(such as percent, dot, colon, backslash, etc.) must be escaped with a
backslash (see the PROMPTS section for details).</p>
</dd>
<dt>
^X
</dt>
<dd>When the &#34;Waiting for data&#34; message is displayed, such as while
in the F command, pressing ^X will stop <strong>less</strong> from waiting and return
to a prompt. This may cause <strong>less</strong> to think that the file ends at the
current position, so it may be necessary to use the R or F command to
see more data. The –intr option can be used to specify a different
character to use instead of ^X. This command works only on systems
that support the *poll*(2) function. On systems without *poll*(2), the
interrupt character (usually ^C) can be used instead.</dd>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Command line options are described below. Most options may be changed
while <strong>less</strong> is running, via the &#34;-&#34; command.</p>
<p>
Some options may be given in one of two forms: either a dash followed by
a single letter, or two dashes followed by a long option name. A long
option name may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is
unambiguous. For example, –quit-at-eof may be abbreviated –quit, but
not –qui, since both –quit-at-eof and –quiet begin with –qui. Some
long option names are in uppercase, such as –QUIT-AT-EOF, as distinct
from –quit-at-eof. Such option names need only have their first letter
capitalized; the remainder of the name may be in either case. For
example, –Quit-at-eof is equivalent to –QUIT-AT-EOF.</p>
<p>
Options are also taken from the environment variable &#34;LESS&#34;. For
example, to avoid typing &#34;less -options …&#34; each time <strong>less</strong> is
invoked, you might tell <strong>csh</strong>:</p>
<p>
setenv LESS &#34;-options&#34;</p>
<p>
or if you use <strong>sh</strong>:</p>
<p>
LESS=&#34;-options&#34;; export LESS</p>
<p>
On MS-DOS and Windows, you don&#39;t need the quotes, but you should be
careful that any percent signs in the options string are not interpreted
as an environment variable expansion.</p>
<p>
The environment variable is parsed before the command line, so command
line options override the LESS environment variable. If an option
appears in the LESS variable, it can be reset to its default value on
the command line by beginning the command line option with &#34;-+&#34;.</p>
<p>
Some options like -k or -D require a string to follow the option letter.
The string for that option is considered to end when a dollar sign ($)
is found. For example, you can set two -D options like this:</p>
<p>
LESS=&#34;Dnwb$Dsbw&#34;</p>
<p>
If the –use-backslash option appears earlier in the options, then a
dollar sign or backslash may be included literally in an option string
by preceding it with a backslash. If the –use-backslash option is not
in effect, then backslashes are not treated specially, and there is no
way to include a dollar sign in the option string.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-? or –help
</dt>
<dd>This option displays a summary of the commands
accepted by <strong>less</strong> (the same as the h command). (Depending on how your
shell interprets the question mark, it may be necessary to quote the
question mark, thus: &#34;-\?&#34;.)</dd>
<dt>
-a or –search-skip-screen
</dt>
<dd>By default, forward searches start at
the top of the displayed screen and backwards searches start at the
bottom of the displayed screen (except for repeated searches invoked
by the n or N commands, which start after or before the &#34;target&#34; line
respectively; see the -j option for more about the target line). The
-a option causes forward searches to instead start at the bottom of
the screen and backward searches to start at the top of the screen,
thus skipping all lines displayed on the screen.</dd>
<dt>
-A or –SEARCH-SKIP-SCREEN
</dt>
<dd>Causes all forward searches (not just
non-repeated searches) to start just after the target line, and all
backward searches to start just before the target line. Thus, forward
searches will skip part of the displayed screen (from the first line
up to and including the target line). Similarly backwards searches
will skip the displayed screen from the last line up to and including
the target line. This was the default behavior in less versions prior
to 441.</dd>
<dt>
-bn or –buffers=n
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the amount of buffer space <strong>less</strong> will
use for each file, in units of kilobytes (1024 bytes). By default 64
KB of buffer space is used for each file (unless the file is a pipe;
see the -B option). The -b option specifies instead that <em>n</em> kilobytes
of buffer space should be used for each file. If <em>n</em> is -1, buffer
space is unlimited; that is, the entire file can be read into memory.</dd>
<dt>
-B or –auto-buffers
</dt>
<dd>By default, when data is read from a pipe,
buffers are allocated automatically as needed. If a large amount of
data is read from the pipe, this can cause a large amount of memory to
be allocated. The -B option disables this automatic allocation of
buffers for pipes, so that only 64 KB (or the amount of space
specified by the -b option) is used for the pipe. Warning: use of -B
can result in erroneous display, since only the most recently viewed
part of the piped data is kept in memory; any earlier data is lost.
Lost characters are displayed as question marks.</dd>
<dt>
-c or –clear-screen
</dt>
<dd>Causes full screen repaints to be painted from
the top line down. By default, full screen repaints are done by
scrolling from the bottom of the screen.</dd>
<dt>
-C or –CLEAR-SCREEN
</dt>
<dd>Same as -c, for compatibility with older
versions of <strong>less</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-d or –dumb
</dt>
<dd>The -d option suppresses the error message normally
displayed if the terminal is dumb; that is, lacks some important
capability, such as the ability to clear the screen or scroll
backward. The -d option does not otherwise change the behavior of
<strong>less</strong> on a dumb terminal.</dd>
<dt>
-Dxcolor or –color=xcolor
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Changes the color of different parts of
the displayed text. <strong>x</strong> is a single character which selects the type
of text whose color is being set:</p>
<ol>
<li value="2">Binary characters.</li>
<li>Control characters.</li>
<li>Errors and informational messages.</li>
<li>Header lines and columns, set via the –header option.</li>
<li>Mark letters in the status column.</li>
<li>Line numbers enabled via the -N option.</li>
<li>Prompts.</li>
<li>The rscroll character.</li>
<li>Search results.</li>
<li>The highlight enabled via the -w option.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>
1-5
</dt>
<dd>The text in a search result which matches the first through
fifth parenthesized sub-pattern. Sub-pattern coloring works only if
<strong>less</strong> is built with one of the regular expression libraries
<strong>posix</strong>, <strong>pcre</strong>, or <strong>pcre2</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li value="4">Bold text.</li>
<li>Blinking text.</li>
<li>Standout text.</li>
<li>Underlined text.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>The uppercase letters and digits can be used only when the –use-color
option is enabled. When text color is specified by both an uppercase
letter and a lowercase letter, the uppercase letter takes precedence.
For example, error messages are normally displayed as standout text. So
if both &#34;s&#34; and &#34;E&#34; are given a color, the &#34;E&#34; color applies to error
messages, and the &#34;s&#34; color applies to other standout text. The
lowercase letters refer to bold and underline text formed by
overstriking with backspaces (see the -U option) and to non-content text
(such as line numbers and prompts), but not to text formatted using ANSI
escape sequences with the -R option (but see the note below for
different behavior on Windows and MS-DOS).</p>
<p>
A lowercase letter may be followed by a + to indicate that the normal
format change and the specified color should both be used. For example,
-Dug displays underlined text as green without underlining; the green
color has replaced the usual underline formatting. But -Du+g displays
underlined text as both green and in underlined format.</p>
<p>
<em>color</em> is either a 4-bit color string or an 8-bit color string:</p>
<p>
A 4-bit color string is one or two characters, where the first character
specifies the foreground color and the second specifies the background
color as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li value="2">Blue</li>
<li>Cyan</li>
<li>Green</li>
<li>Black</li>
<li>Magenta</li>
<li>Red</li>
<li>White</li>
<li>Yellow</li>
</ol>
<p>The corresponding uppercase letter denotes a brighter shade of the
color. For example, -DNGk displays line numbers as bright green text on
a black background, and -DEbR displays error messages as blue text on a
bright red background. If either character is a &#34;-&#34; or is omitted, the
corresponding color is set to that of normal text.</p>
<p>
An 8-bit color string is one or two decimal integers separated by a dot,
where the first integer specifies the foreground color and the second
specifies the background color. Each integer is a value between 0 and
255 inclusive which selects a &#34;CSI 38;5&#34; color value (see</p>
<p>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#SGR).</p>
<p>
If either integer is a &#34;-&#34; or is omitted, the corresponding color is set
to that of normal text.</p>
<p>
A 4-bit or 8-bit color string may be followed by one or more of the
following characters to set text attributes in addition to the color.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
s or ~
</dt>
<dd>Standout (reverse video)</dd>
<dt>
u or _
</dt>
<dd>Underline</dd>
<dt>
d or *
</dt>
<dd>Bold</dd>
<dt>
l or &amp;
</dt>
<dd>Blinking</dd>
</dl>
<p>On MS-DOS and Windows, the –color option behaves differently from what
is described above in these ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bold (d and *) and blinking (l and &amp;) text attributes at the end
of a color string are not supported.</li>
<li>Lowercase color selector letters refer to text formatted by ANSI
escape sequences with -R, in addition to overstruck and non-content
text (but see -Da).</li>
<li>For historical reasons, when a lowercase color selector letter is
followed by a numeric color value, the number is not interpreted as an
&#34;CSI 38;5&#34; color value as described above, but instead as a 4-bit</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAR_INFO.Attributes</p>
<p>
value, between 0 and 15 inclusive (see</p>
<p>
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/char-info-str).</p>
<p>
To avoid confusion, it is recommended that the equivalent letters rather
than numbers be used after a lowercase color selector on MS-DOS/Windows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Numeric color values (&#34;CSI 38;5&#34; color) following an uppercase color
selector letter are not supported on systems earlier than Windows 10.</li>
<li>Only a limited set of ANSI escape sequences to set color in the
content work correctly. 4-bit color sequences work, but &#34;CSI 38;5&#34;
color sequences do not.</li>
<li>The -Da option makes the behavior of –color more similar to its
behavior on non-MS-DOS/Windows systems by (1) making lowercase color
selector letters not affect text formatted with ANSI escape sequences,
and (2) allowing &#34;CSI 38;5&#34; color sequences in the content work by
passing them to the terminal (only on Windows 10 and later; on earlier
Windows systems, such sequences do not work regardless of the setting
of -Da).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
-e or –quit-at-eof
</dt>
<dd>Causes <strong>less</strong> to automatically exit the second
time it reaches end-of-file. By default, the only way to exit <strong>less</strong>
is via the &#34;q&#34; command.</dd>
<dt>
-E or –QUIT-AT-EOF
</dt>
<dd>Causes <strong>less</strong> to automatically exit the first
time it reaches end-of-file.</dd>
<dt>
-f or –force
</dt>
<dd>Forces non-regular files to be opened. (A non-regular
file is a directory or a device special file.) Also suppresses the
warning message when a binary file is opened. By default, <strong>less</strong> will
refuse to open non-regular files. Note that some operating systems
will not allow directories to be read, even if -f is set.</dd>
<dt>
-F or –quit-if-one-screen
</dt>
<dd>Causes <strong>less</strong> to automatically exit if
the entire file can be displayed on the first screen.</dd>
<dt>
-g or –hilite-search
</dt>
<dd>Normally, <strong>less</strong> will highlight ALL strings
which match the last search command. The -g option changes this
behavior to highlight only the particular string which was found by
the last search command. This can cause <strong>less</strong> to run somewhat faster
than the default.</dd>
<dt>
-G or –HILITE-SEARCH
</dt>
<dd>The -G option suppresses all highlighting of
strings found by search commands.</dd>
<dt>
-hn or –max-back-scroll=n
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a maximum number of lines to
scroll backward. If it is necessary to scroll backward more than <em>n</em>
lines, the screen is repainted in a forward direction instead. (If the
terminal does not have the ability to scroll backward, -h0 is
implied.)</dd>
<dt>
-i or –ignore-case
</dt>
<dd>Causes searches to ignore case; that is,
uppercase and lowercase are considered identical. This option is
ignored if any uppercase letters appear in the search pattern; in
other words, if a pattern contains uppercase letters, then that search
does not ignore case.</dd>
<dt>
-I or –IGNORE-CASE
</dt>
<dd>Like -i, but searches ignore case even if the
pattern contains uppercase letters.</dd>
<dt>
-jn or –jump-target=n
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a line on the screen where the
&#34;target&#34; line is to be positioned. The target line is the line
specified by any command to search for a pattern, jump to a line
number, jump to a file percentage or jump to a tag. The screen line
may be specified by a number: the top line on the screen is 1, the
next is 2, and so on. The number may be negative to specify a line
relative to the bottom of the screen: the bottom line on the screen is
-1, the second to the bottom is -2, and so on. Alternately, the screen
line may be specified as a fraction of the height of the screen,
starting with a decimal point: .5 is in the middle of the screen, .3
is three tenths down from the first line, and so on. If the line is
specified as a fraction, the actual line number is recalculated if the
terminal window is resized. If the –header option is used and the
target line specified by -j would be obscured by the header, the
target line is moved to the first line after the header. While the
–header option is active, the -S option is ignored, and lines longer
than the screen width are truncated.

If any form of the -j option is used, repeated forward searches
(invoked with &#34;n&#34; or &#34;N&#34;) begin at the line immediately after the
target line, and repeated backward searches begin at the target line,
unless changed by -a or -A. For example, if &#34;-j4&#34; is used, the target
line is the fourth line on the screen, so forward searches begin at
the fifth line on the screen. However nonrepeated searches (invoked
with &#34;/&#34; or &#34;?&#34;) always begin at the start or end of the current
screen respectively.</dd>
<dt>
-J or –status-column
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Displays a status column at the left edge of
the screen. The character displayed in the status column may be one
of:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The line is chopped with the -S option, and the text that is
chopped off beyond the right edge of the screen contains a match for
the current search.</dd>
<dt>
&lt;
</dt>
<dd>The line is horizontally shifted, and the text that is shifted
beyond the left side of the screen contains a match for the current
search.</dd>
<dt>
=
</dt>
<dd>The line is both chopped and shifted, and there are matches
beyond both sides of the screen.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd>There are matches in the visible part of the line but none to the
right or left of it.</dd>
<dt>
a-z, A-Z
</dt>
<dd>The line has been marked with the corresponding letter
via the m command.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
-kfilename or –lesskey-file=filename
</dt>
<dd>Causes <strong>less</strong> to open and
interpret the named file as a *lesskey*(1) binary file. Multiple -k
options may be specified. If the LESSKEY or LESSKEY_SYSTEM environment
variable is set, or if a lesskey file is found in a standard place
(see KEY BINDINGS), it is also used as a <strong>lesskey</strong> file. Note the
warning under &#34;–lesskey-content&#34; below.</dd>
<dt>
–lesskey-src=filename
</dt>
<dd>Causes <strong>less</strong> to open and interpret the
named file as a *lesskey*(1) source file. If the LESSKEYIN or
LESSKEYIN_SYSTEM environment variable is set, or if a lesskey source
file is found in a standard place (see KEY BINDINGS), it is also used
as a <em>lesskey source</em> file. Prior to version 582, the <strong>lesskey</strong>
program needed to be run to convert a <em>lesskey source</em> file to a
<em>lesskey binary</em> file for <strong>less</strong> to use. Newer versions of <strong>less</strong> read
the <em>lesskey source</em> file directly and ignore the binary file if the
source file exists. Note the warning under &#34;–lesskey-content&#34; below.</dd>
<dt>
–lesskey-content=text
</dt>
<dd>Causes less to interpret the specified text
as the contents of a <strong>lesskey*(1) source file. In the text, *lesskey</strong>
lines may be separated by either newlines as usual, or by semicolons.
A literal semicolon may be represented by a backslash followed by a
semicolon.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Warning: certain environment variables such as LESS, LESSSECURE,
LESSCHARSET and others, which are used early in startup, cannot be set
in a file specified by a command line option (–lesskey, –lesskey-src
or –lesskey-content). When using a <strong>lesskey</strong> file to set environment
variables, it is safer to use the default lesskey file, or to specify
the file using the LESSKEYIN or LESSKEY_CONTENT environment variables
rather than using a command line option.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-K or –quit-on-intr
</dt>
<dd>Causes <strong>less</strong> to exit immediately (with
status 2) when an interrupt character (usually ^C) is typed. Normally,
an interrupt character causes <strong>less</strong> to stop whatever it is doing and
return to its command prompt. Note that use of this option makes it
impossible to return to the command prompt from the &#34;F&#34; command.</dd>
<dt>
-L or –no-lessopen
</dt>
<dd>Ignore the LESSOPEN environment variable (see
the INPUT PREPROCESSOR section below). This option can be set from
within <strong>less</strong>, but it will apply only to files opened subsequently,
not to the file which is currently open.</dd>
<dt>
-m or –long-prompt
</dt>
<dd>Causes <strong>less</strong> to prompt verbosely (like
<strong>more*(1)), with the percent into the file. By default, *less</strong> prompts
with a colon.</dd>
<dt>
-M or –LONG-PROMPT
</dt>
<dd>Causes <strong>less</strong> to prompt even more verbosely
than *more*(1).</dd>
<dt>
-n or –line-numbers
</dt>
<dd>Suppresses line numbers. The default (to use
line numbers) may cause <strong>less</strong> to run more slowly in some cases,
especially with a very large input file. Suppressing line numbers with
the -n option will avoid this problem. Using line numbers means: the
line number will be displayed in the verbose prompt and in the =
command, and the v command will pass the current line number to the
editor (see also the discussion of LESSEDIT in PROMPTS below).</dd>
<dt>
-N or –LINE-NUMBERS
</dt>
<dd>Causes a line number to be displayed at the
beginning of each line in the display.</dd>
<dt>
-ofilename or –log-file=filename
</dt>
<dd>Causes <strong>less</strong> to copy its input
to the named file as it is being viewed. This applies only when the
input file is a pipe, not an ordinary file. If the file already
exists, <strong>less</strong> will ask for confirmation before overwriting it.</dd>
<dt>
-Ofilename or –LOG-FILE=filename
</dt>
<dd>The -O option is like -o, but it
will overwrite an existing file without asking for confirmation.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If no log file has been specified, the -o and -O options can be used
from within <strong>less</strong> to specify a log file. Without a file name, they will
simply report the name of the log file. The &#34;s&#34; command is equivalent to
specifying -o from within <strong>less</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-ppattern or –pattern=pattern
</dt>
<dd>The -p option on the command line is
equivalent to specifying +//pattern/; that is, it tells <strong>less</strong> to
start at the first occurrence of <em>pattern</em> in the file.</dd>
<dt>
-Pprompt or –prompt=prompt
</dt>
<dd>Provides a way to tailor the three
prompt styles to your own preference. This option would normally be
put in the LESS environment variable, rather than being typed in with
each <strong>less</strong> command. Such an option must either be the last option in
the LESS variable, or be terminated by a dollar sign. -Ps followed by
a string changes the default (short) prompt to that string. -Pm
changes the medium (-m) prompt. -PM changes the long (-M) prompt. -Ph
changes the prompt for the help screen. -P= changes the message
printed by the = command. -Pw changes the message printed while
waiting for data (in the &#34;F&#34; command).</dd>
</dl>
<p>All prompt strings consist of a sequence of letters and special escape
sequences. See the section on PROMPTS for more details.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-q or –quiet or –silent
</dt>
<dd>Causes moderately &#34;quiet&#34; operation: the
terminal bell is not rung if an attempt is made to scroll past the end
of the file or before the beginning of the file. If the terminal has a
&#34;visual bell&#34;, it is used instead. The bell will be rung on certain
other errors, such as typing an invalid character. The default is to
ring the terminal bell in all such cases.</dd>
<dt>
-Q or –QUIET or –SILENT
</dt>
<dd>Causes totally &#34;quiet&#34; operation: the
terminal bell is never rung. If the terminal has a &#34;visual bell&#34;, it
is used in all cases where the terminal bell would have been rung.</dd>
<dt>
-r or –raw-control-chars
</dt>
<dd>Causes &#34;raw&#34; control characters to be
displayed. The default is to display control characters using the
caret notation; for example, a control-A (octal 001) is displayed as
&#34;^A&#34; (with some exceptions as described under the -U option). Warning:
when the -r option is used, <strong>less</strong> cannot keep track of the actual
appearance of the screen (since this depends on how the screen
responds to each type of control character). Thus, various display
problems may result, such as long lines being split in the wrong
place.</dd>
</dl>
<p>USE OF THE -r OPTION IS NOT RECOMMENDED.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-R or –RAW-CONTROL-CHARS
</dt>
<dd>Like -r, but only ANSI &#34;color&#34; escape
sequences and OSC 8 hyperlink sequences are output in &#34;raw&#34; form.
Unlike -r, the screen appearance is maintained correctly, provided
that there are no escape sequences in the file other than these types
of escape sequences. Color escape sequences are only supported when
the color is changed within one line, not across lines. In other
words, the beginning of each line is assumed to be normal
(non-colored), regardless of any escape sequences in previous lines.
For the purpose of keeping track of screen appearance, these escape
sequences are assumed to not move the cursor.</dd>
</dl>
<p>OSC 8 hyperlinks are sequences of the form:</p>
<p>
ESC ] 8 ; … \7</p>
<p>
The terminating sequence may be either a BEL character (\7) or the
two-character sequence &#34;ESC \&#34;.</p>
<p>
ANSI color escape sequences are sequences of the form:</p>
<p>
ESC [ … m</p>
<p>
where the &#34;…&#34; is zero or more color specification characters. You can
make <strong>less</strong> think that characters other than &#34;m&#34; can end ANSI color
escape sequences by setting the environment variable LESSANSIENDCHARS to
the list of characters which can end a color escape sequence. And you
can make <strong>less</strong> think that characters other than the standard ones may
appear between the ESC and the m by setting the environment variable
LESSANSIMIDCHARS to the list of characters which can appear.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-s or –squeeze-blank-lines
</dt>
<dd>Causes consecutive blank lines to be
squeezed into a single blank line. This is useful when viewing <strong>nroff</strong>
output.</dd>
<dt>
-S or –chop-long-lines
</dt>
<dd>Causes lines longer than the screen width
to be chopped (truncated) rather than wrapped. That is, the portion of
a long line that does not fit in the screen width is not displayed
until you press RIGHT-ARROW. The default is to wrap long lines; that
is, display the remainder on the next line. See also the –wordwrap
option.</dd>
<dt>
-ttag or –tag=tag
</dt>
<dd>The -t option, followed immediately by a TAG,
will edit the file containing that tag. For this to work, tag
information must be available; for example, there may be a file in the
current directory called &#34;tags&#34;, which was previously built by
*ctags*(1) or an equivalent command. If the environment variable
LESSGLOBALTAGS is set, it is taken to be the name of a command
compatible with *global*(1), and that command is executed to find the
tag. (See</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/global/global.html).">http://www.gnu.org/software/global/global.html).</a></p>
<p>
The -t option may also be specified from within <strong>less</strong> (using the -
command) as a way of examining a new file. The command &#34;:t&#34; is
equivalent to specifying -t from within <strong>less</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-Ttagsfile or –tag-file=tagsfile
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a tags file to be used
instead of &#34;tags&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
-u or –underline-special
</dt>
<dd>Causes backspaces and carriage returns to
be treated as printable characters; that is, they are sent to the
terminal when they appear in the input.</dd>
<dt>
-U or –UNDERLINE-SPECIAL
</dt>
<dd>Causes backspaces, tabs, carriage returns
and &#34;formatting characters&#34; (as defined by Unicode) to be treated as
control characters; that is, they are handled as specified by the -r
option.</dd>
</dl>
<p>By default, if neither -u nor -U is given, backspaces which appear
adjacent to an underscore character are treated specially: the
underlined text is displayed using the terminal&#39;s hardware underlining
capability. Also, backspaces which appear between two identical
characters are treated specially: the overstruck text is printed using
the terminal&#39;s hardware boldface capability. Other backspaces are
deleted, along with the preceding character. Carriage returns
immediately followed by a newline are deleted. Other carriage returns
are handled as specified by the -r option. Unicode formatting
characters, such as the Byte Order Mark, are sent to the terminal. Text
which is overstruck or underlined can be searched for if neither -u nor
-U is in effect.</p>
<p>
See also the –proc-backspace, –proc-tab, and –proc-return options.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-V or –version
</dt>
<dd>Displays the version number of <strong>less</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-w or –hilite-unread
</dt>
<dd>Temporarily highlights the first &#34;new&#34; line
after a forward movement of a full page. The first &#34;new&#34; line is the
line immediately following the line previously at the bottom of the
screen. Also highlights the target line after a g or p command. The
highlight is removed at the next command which causes movement. If the
–status-line option is in effect, the entire line (the width of the
screen) is highlighted. Otherwise, only the text in the line is
highlighted, unless the -J option is in effect, in which case only the
status column is highlighted.</dd>
<dt>
-W or –HILITE-UNREAD
</dt>
<dd>Like -w, but temporarily highlights the first
new line after any forward movement command larger than one line.</dd>
<dt>
-xn,… or –tabs=n,…
</dt>
<dd>Sets tab stops. If only one <em>n</em> is
specified, tab stops are set at multiples of <em>n</em>. If multiple values
separated by commas are specified, tab stops are set at those
positions, and then continue with the same spacing as the last two.
For example, &#34;-x9,17&#34; will set tabs at positions 9, 17, 25, 33, etc.
The default for <em>n</em> is 8.</dd>
<dt>
-X or –no-init
</dt>
<dd>Disables sending the termcap initialization and
deinitialization strings to the terminal. This is sometimes desirable
if the deinitialization string does something unnecessary, like
clearing the screen.</dd>
<dt>
-yn or –max-forw-scroll=n
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a maximum number of lines to
scroll forward. If it is necessary to scroll forward more than <em>n</em>
lines, the screen is repainted instead. The -c or -C option may be
used to repaint from the top of the screen if desired. By default, any
forward movement causes scrolling.</dd>
<dt>
-zn or –window=n or -n
</dt>
<dd>Changes the default scrolling window size
to <em>n</em> lines. The default is one screenful. The z and w commands can
also be used to change the window size. The &#34;z&#34; may be omitted for
compatibility with some versions of *more*(1). If the number <em>n</em> is
negative, it indicates <em>n</em> lines less than the current screen size.
For example, if the screen is 24 lines, <em>-z-4</em> sets the scrolling
window to 20 lines. If the screen is resized to 40 lines, the
scrolling window automatically changes to 36 lines.</dd>
<dt>
-&#34;cc or –quotes=cc
</dt>
<dd>Changes the filename quoting character. This
may be necessary if you are trying to name a file which contains both
spaces and quote characters. Followed by a single character, this
changes the quote character to that character. Filenames containing a
space should then be surrounded by that character rather than by
double quotes. Followed by two characters, changes the open quote to
the first character, and the close quote to the second character.
Filenames containing a space should then be preceded by the open quote
character and followed by the close quote character. Note that even
after the quote characters are changed, this option remains -&#34; (a dash
followed by a double quote).</dd>
<dt>
-~ or –tilde
</dt>
<dd>Normally lines after end of file are displayed as a
single tilde (~). This option causes lines after end of file to be
displayed as blank lines.</dd>
<dt>
-# or –shift
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the default number of positions to scroll
horizontally in the RIGHTARROW and LEFTARROW commands. If the number
specified is zero, it sets the default number of positions to one half
of the screen width. Alternately, the number may be specified as a
fraction of the width of the screen, starting with a decimal point: .5
is half of the screen width, .3 is three tenths of the screen width,
and so on. If the number is specified as a fraction, the actual number
of scroll positions is recalculated if the terminal window is resized.</dd>
<dt>
–exit-follow-on-close
</dt>
<dd>When using the &#34;F&#34; command on a pipe, <strong>less</strong>
will automatically stop waiting for more data when the input side of
the pipe is closed.</dd>
<dt>
–file-size
</dt>
<dd>If –file-size is specified, <strong>less</strong> will determine the
size of the file immediately after opening the file. Then the &#34;=&#34;
command will display the number of lines in the file. Normally this is
not done, because it can be slow if the input file is non-seekable
(such as a pipe) and is large.</dd>
<dt>
–follow-name
</dt>
<dd>Normally, if the input file is renamed while an F
command is executing, <strong>less</strong> will continue to display the contents of
the original file despite its name change. If –follow-name is
specified, during an F command <strong>less</strong> will periodically attempt to
reopen the file by name. If the reopen succeeds and the file is a
different file from the original (which means that a new file has been
created with the same name as the original (now renamed) file), <strong>less</strong>
will display the contents of that new file.</dd>
<dt>
–header=L,C,N
</dt>
<dd>

Sets the number of header lines and columns displayed on the screen.
The number of header lines is set to <em>L</em>. If <em>L</em> is 0, header lines
are disabled. If <em>L</em> is empty or missing, the number of header lines
is unchanged. The number of header columns is set to <em>C</em>. If <em>C</em> is 0,
header columns are disabled. If <em>C</em> is empty or missing, the number of
header columns is unchanged. The first header line is set to line
number <em>N</em> in the file. If <em>N</em> is empty or missing, it is taken to be
the number of the line currently displayed in the first line of the
screen (if the –header command has been issued from within <strong>less</strong>),
or 1 (if the –header option has been given on the command line). The
special form &#34;–header=-&#34; disables header lines and header columns,
and is equivalent to &#34;–header=0,0&#34;.

When <em>L</em> is nonzero, the first <em>L</em> lines at the top of the screen are
replaced with the <em>L</em> lines of the file beginning at line <em>N</em>,
regardless of what part of the file is being viewed. When header lines
are displayed, any file contents before the header line cannot be
viewed. When <em>C</em> is nonzero, the first <em>C</em> characters displayed at the
beginning of each line are replaced with the first <em>C</em> characters of
the line, even if the rest of the line is scrolled horizontally.</dd>
<dt>
–incsearch
</dt>
<dd>Subsequent search commands will be &#34;incremental&#34;; that
is, <strong>less</strong> will advance to the next line containing the search pattern
as each character of the pattern is typed in.</dd>
<dt>
–intr=c
</dt>
<dd>Use the character <em>c</em> instead of ^X to interrupt a read
when the &#34;Waiting for data&#34; message is displayed. <em>c</em> must be an ASCII
character; that is, one with a value between 1 and 127 inclusive. A
caret followed by a single character can be used to specify a control
character.</dd>
<dt>
–line-num-width=n
</dt>
<dd>Sets the minimum width of the line number field
when the -N option is in effect to <em>n</em> characters. The default is 7.</dd>
<dt>
–match-shift=n
</dt>
<dd>When -S is in effect, if a search match is not
visible because it is shifted to the left or right of the currently
visible screen, the text will horizontally shift to ensure that the
search match is visible. This option selects the column in which the
first character of the search match will be placed after the shift. In
other words, there will be <em>n</em> characters visible to the left of the
search match.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Alternately, the number may be specified as a fraction of the width of
the screen, starting with a decimal point: .5 is half of the screen
width, .3 is three tenths of the screen width, and so on. If the number
is specified as a fraction, the actual number of scroll positions is
recalculated if the terminal window is resized.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
–modelines=n
</dt>
<dd>

Before displaying a file, <strong>less</strong> will read the first <em>n</em> lines to try
to find a vim-compatible <em>modeline</em>. If <em>n</em> is zero, <strong>less</strong> does not
try to find modelines. By using a modeline, the file itself can
specify the tab stops that should be used when viewing it.

A modeline contains, anywhere in the line, a program name (&#34;vi&#34;,
&#34;vim&#34;, &#34;ex&#34;, or &#34;less&#34;), followed by a colon, possibly followed by the
word &#34;set&#34;, and finally followed by zero or more option settings. If
the word &#34;set&#34; is used, option settings are separated by spaces, and
end at the first colon. If the word &#34;set&#34; is not used, option settings
may be separated by either spaces or colons. The word &#34;set&#34; is
required if the program name is &#34;less&#34; but optional if any of the
other three names are used. If any option setting is of the form
&#34;tabstop=/n/&#34; or &#34;ts=/n/&#34;, then tab stops are automatically set as if
–tabs=/n/ had been given. See the –tabs description for acceptable
values of <em>n</em>.</dd>
<dt>
–mouse
</dt>
<dd>Enables mouse input: scrolling the mouse wheel down moves
forward in the file, scrolling the mouse wheel up moves backwards in
the file, left-click sets the &#34;#&#34; mark to the line where the mouse is
clicked, and right-click (or any other) returns to the &#34;#&#34; mark
position. If a left-click is performed with the mouse cursor on an OSC
8 hyperlink, the hyperlink is selected as if by the ^O^N command. If a
left-click is performed with the mouse cursor on an OSC 8 hyperlink
which is already selected, the hyperlink is opened as if by the ^O^O
command. The number of lines to scroll when the wheel is moved can be
set by the –wheel-lines option. Mouse input works only on terminals
which support X11 mouse reporting, and on the Windows version of
<strong>less</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
–MOUSE
</dt>
<dd>Like –mouse, except the direction scrolled on mouse wheel
movement is reversed.</dd>
<dt>
–no-keypad
</dt>
<dd>Disables sending the keypad initialization and
deinitialization strings to the terminal. This is sometimes useful if
the keypad strings make the numeric keypad behave in an undesirable
manner.</dd>
<dt>
–no-histdups
</dt>
<dd>This option changes the behavior so that if a search
string or file name is typed in, and the same string is already in the
history list, the existing copy is removed from the history list
before the new one is added. Thus, a given string will appear only
once in the history list. Normally, a string may appear multiple
times.</dd>
<dt>
–no-number-headers
</dt>
<dd>Header lines (defined via the –header option)
are not assigned line numbers. Line number 1 is assigned to the first
line after any header lines.</dd>
<dt>
–no-search-header-lines
</dt>
<dd>Searches do not include header lines, but
still include header columns.</dd>
<dt>
–no-search-header-columns
</dt>
<dd>Searches do not include header columns,
but still include header lines.</dd>
<dt>
–no-search-headers
</dt>
<dd>Searches do not include header lines or header
columns.</dd>
<dt>
–no-vbell
</dt>
<dd>Disables the terminal&#39;s visual bell.</dd>
<dt>
–proc-backspace
</dt>
<dd>If set, backspaces are handled as if neither the
-u option nor the -U option were set. That is, a backspace adjacent to
an underscore causes text to be displayed in underline mode, and a
backspace between identical characters cause text to be displayed in
boldface mode. This option overrides the -u and -U options, so that
display of backspaces can be controlled separate from tabs and
carriage returns. If not set, backspace display is controlled by the
-u and -U options.</dd>
<dt>
–PROC-BACKSPACE
</dt>
<dd>If set, backspaces are handled as if the -U option
were set; that is backspaces are treated as control characters.</dd>
<dt>
–proc-return
</dt>
<dd>If set, carriage returns are handled as if neither
the -u option nor the -U option were set. That is, a carriage return
immediately before a newline is deleted. This option overrides the -u
and -U options, so that display of carriage returns can be controlled
separate from that of backspaces and tabs. If not set, carriage return
display is controlled by the -u and -U options.</dd>
<dt>
–PROC-RETURN
</dt>
<dd>If set, carriage returns are handled as if the -U
option were set; that is carriage returns are treated as control
characters.</dd>
<dt>
–proc-tab
</dt>
<dd>If set, tabs are handled as if the -U option were not
set. That is, tabs are expanded to spaces. This option overrides the
-U option, so that display of tabs can be controlled separate from
that of backspaces and carriage returns. If not set, tab display is
controlled by the -U options.</dd>
<dt>
–PROC-TAB
</dt>
<dd>If set, tabs are handled as if the -U option were set;
that is tabs are treated as control characters.</dd>
<dt>
–redraw-on-quit
</dt>
<dd>When quitting, after sending the terminal
deinitialization string, redraws the entire last screen. On terminals
whose terminal deinitialization string causes the terminal to switch
from an alternate screen, this makes the last screenful of the current
file remain visible after <strong>less</strong> has quit.</dd>
<dt>
–rscroll=c
</dt>
<dd>This option changes the character used to mark
truncated lines. It may begin with a two-character attribute indicator
like LESSBINFMT does. If there is no attribute indicator, standout is
used. If set to &#34;-&#34;, truncated lines are not marked.</dd>
<dt>
–save-marks
</dt>
<dd>Save marks in the history file, so marks are retained
across different invocations of <strong>less</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
–search-options=…
</dt>
<dd>Sets default search modifiers. The value is a
string of one or more of the characters E, F, K, N, R or W. Setting
any of these has the same effect as typing that control character at
the beginning of every search pattern. For example, setting
–search-options=W is the same as typing ^W at the beginning of every
pattern. The value may also contain a digit between 1 and 5, which has
the same effect as typing ^S followed by that digit at the beginning
of every search pattern. The value &#34;-&#34; disables all default search
modifiers.</dd>
<dt>
–show-preproc-errors
</dt>
<dd>If a preprocessor produces data, then exits
with a non-zero exit code, <strong>less</strong> will display a warning.</dd>
<dt>
–status-col-width=n
</dt>
<dd>Sets the width of the status column when the
-J option is in effect. The default is 2 characters.</dd>
<dt>
–status-line
</dt>
<dd>If a line is marked, the entire line (rather than
just the status column) is highlighted. Also lines highlighted due to
the -w option will have the entire line highlighted. If –use-color is
set, the line is colored rather than highlighted.</dd>
<dt>
–use-backslash
</dt>
<dd>This option changes the interpretations of options
which follow this one. After the –use-backslash option, any backslash
in an option string is removed and the following character is taken
literally. This allows a dollar sign to be included in option strings.</dd>
<dt>
–use-color
</dt>
<dd>Enables colored text in various places. The -D option
can be used to change the colors. Colored text works only if the
terminal supports ANSI color escape sequences (as defined in</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-48).">https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-48).</a></p>
<dl>
<dt>
–wheel-lines=n
</dt>
<dd>Set the number of lines to scroll when the mouse
wheel is scrolled and the –mouse or –MOUSE option is in effect. The
default is 1 line.</dd>
<dt>
–wordwrap
</dt>
<dd>When the -S option is not in use, wrap each line at a
space or tab if possible, so that a word is not split between two
lines. The default is to wrap at any character.</dd>
<dt>
–
</dt>
<dd>A command line argument of &#34;–&#34; marks the end of option
arguments. Any arguments following this are interpreted as filenames.
This can be useful when viewing a file whose name begins with a &#34;-&#34; or
&#34;+&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd>If a command line option begins with <strong>+</strong>, the remainder of that option
is taken to be an initial command to <strong>less</strong>. For example, +G tells
<strong>less</strong> to start at the end of the file rather than the beginning, and
+/xyz tells it to start at the first occurrence of &#34;xyz&#34; in the file.
As a special case, +&lt;number&gt; acts like +&lt;number&gt;g; that is, it starts
the display at the specified line number (however, see the caveat
under the &#34;g&#34; command above). If the option starts with ++, the
initial command applies to every file being viewed, not just the first
one. The + command described previously may also be used to set (or
change) an initial command for every file.</dd>

KEY BINDINGS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-2">
<p>You may define your own <strong>less</strong> commands by creating a lesskey source
file. This file specifies a set of command keys and an action associated
with each key. You may also change the line-editing keys (see LINE
EDITING), and set environment variables used by <strong>less</strong>. See the
*lesskey*(1) manual page for details about the file format.</p>
<p>
If the environment variable LESSKEYIN is set, <strong>less</strong> uses that as the
name of the lesskey source file. Otherwise, <strong>less</strong> looks in a standard
place for the lesskey source file: On Unix systems, <strong>less</strong> looks for a
lesskey file called &#34;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lesskey&#34; or
&#34;$HOME/.config/lesskey&#34; or &#34;$HOME/.lesskey&#34;. On MS-DOS and Windows
systems, *less* looks for a lesskey file called &#34;$HOME/_lesskey&#34;, and if
it is not found there, then looks for a lesskey file called &#34;_lesskey&#34;
in any directory specified in the PATH environment variable. On OS/2
systems, <strong>less</strong> looks for a lesskey file called &#34;$HOME/lesskey.ini&#34;, and
if it is not found, then looks for a lesskey file called &#34;lesskey.ini&#34;
in any directory specified in the INIT environment variable, and if it
not found there, then looks for a lesskey file called &#34;lesskey.ini&#34; in
any directory specified in the PATH environment variable.</p>
<p>
A system-wide lesskey source file may also be set up to provide key
bindings. If a key is defined in both a local lesskey file and in the
system-wide file, key bindings in the local file take precedence over
those in the system-wide file. If the environment variable
LESSKEYIN_SYSTEM is set, <strong>less</strong> uses that as the name of the system-wide
lesskey file. Otherwise, <strong>less</strong> looks in a standard place for the
system-wide lesskey file: On Unix systems, the system-wide lesskey file
is /usr/local/etc/syslesskey. (However, if <strong>less</strong> was built with a
different sysconf directory than /usr/local/etc, that directory is where
the sysless file is found.) On MS-DOS and Windows systems, the
system-wide lesskey file is c:\_syslesskey. On OS/2 systems, the
system-wide lesskey file is c:\syslesskey.ini.</p>
<p>
Previous versions of <strong>less</strong> (before v582) used lesskey files with a
binary format, produced by the <strong>lesskey</strong> program. It is no longer
necessary to use the <strong>lesskey</strong> program.</p>

<h2 id="headline-12">
INPUT PREPROCESSOR
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-2">
<p>You may define an &#34;input preprocessor&#34; for <strong>less</strong>. Before <strong>less</strong> opens a
file, it first gives your input preprocessor a chance to modify the way
the contents of the file are displayed. An input preprocessor is simply
an executable program (or shell script), which writes the contents of
the file to a different file, called the replacement file. The contents
of the replacement file are then displayed in place of the contents of
the original file. However, it will appear to the user as if the
original file is opened; that is, <strong>less</strong> will display the original
filename as the name of the current file.</p>
<p>
An input preprocessor receives one command line argument, the original
filename, as entered by the user. It should create the replacement file,
and when finished, print the name of the replacement file to its
standard output. If the input preprocessor does not output a replacement
filename, <strong>less</strong> uses the original file, as normal. The input
preprocessor is not called when viewing standard input. To set up an
input preprocessor, set the LESSOPEN environment variable to a command
line which will invoke your input preprocessor. This command line should
include one occurrence of the string &#34;%s&#34;, which will be replaced by the
filename when the input preprocessor command is invoked.</p>
<p>
When <strong>less</strong> closes a file opened in such a way, it will call another
program, called the input postprocessor, which may perform any desired
clean-up action (such as deleting the replacement file created by
LESSOPEN). This program receives two command line arguments, the
original filename as entered by the user, and the name of the
replacement file. To set up an input postprocessor, set the LESSCLOSE
environment variable to a command line which will invoke your input
postprocessor. It may include two occurrences of the string &#34;%s&#34;; the
first is replaced with the original name of the file and the second with
the name of the replacement file, which was output by LESSOPEN.</p>
<p>
For example, on many Unix systems, these two scripts will allow you to
keep files in compressed format, but still let <strong>less</strong> view them
directly:</p>
<p>
lessopen.sh:<br>
​#! /bin/sh<br>
case &#34;$1&#34; in\\
​*.Z) TEMPFILE=$(mktemp)<br>
uncompress -c $1 &gt;$TEMPFILE 2&gt;/dev/null<br>
if [ -s $TEMPFILE ]; then\\
echo $TEMPFILE<br>
else<br>
rm -f $TEMPFILE<br>
fi<br>
;;<br>
esac</p>
<p>
lessclose.sh:<br>
​#! /bin/sh<br>
rm $2</p>
<p>
To use these scripts, put them both where they can be executed and set
LESSOPEN=&#34;lessopen.sh %s&#34;, and LESSCLOSE=&#34;lessclose.sh %s %s&#34;. More
complex LESSOPEN and LESSCLOSE scripts may be written to accept other
types of compressed files, and so on.</p>
<p>
It is also possible to set up an input preprocessor to pipe the file
data directly to <strong>less</strong>, rather than putting the data into a replacement
file. This avoids the need to decompress the entire file before starting
to view it. An input preprocessor that works this way is called an input
pipe. An input pipe, instead of writing the name of a replacement file
on its standard output, writes the entire contents of the replacement
file on its standard output. If the input pipe does not write any
characters on its standard output, then there is no replacement file and
<strong>less</strong> uses the original file, as normal. To use an input pipe, make the
first character in the LESSOPEN environment variable a vertical bar (|)
to signify that the input preprocessor is an input pipe. As with
non-pipe input preprocessors, the command string must contain one
occurrence of %s, which is replaced with the filename of the input file.</p>
<p>
For example, on many Unix systems, this script will work like the
previous example scripts:</p>
<p>
lesspipe.sh:<br>
​#! /bin/sh<br>
case &#34;$1&#34; in\\
​*.Z) uncompress -c $1 2&gt;/dev/null<br>
;;<br>
​*) exit 1<br>
;;<br>
esac<br>
exit $?\\</p>
<p>
To use this script, put it where it can be executed and set
LESSOPEN=&#34;|lesspipe.sh %s&#34;.</p>
<p>
Note that a preprocessor cannot output an empty file, since that is
interpreted as meaning there is no replacement, and the original file is
used. To avoid this, if LESSOPEN starts with two vertical bars, the exit
status of the script determines the behavior when the output is empty.
If the output is empty and the exit status is zero, the empty output is
considered to be replacement text. If the output is empty and the exit
status is nonzero, the original file is used. For compatibility with
previous versions of <strong>less</strong>, if LESSOPEN starts with only one vertical
bar, the exit status of the preprocessor is ignored.</p>
<p>
When an input pipe is used, a LESSCLOSE postprocessor can be used, but
it is usually not necessary since there is no replacement file to clean
up. In this case, the replacement file name passed to the LESSCLOSE
postprocessor is &#34;-&#34;.</p>
<p>
For compatibility with previous versions of <strong>less</strong>, the input
preprocessor or pipe is not used if <strong>less</strong> is viewing standard input.
However, if the first character of LESSOPEN is a dash (-), the input
preprocessor is used on standard input as well as other files. In this
case, the dash is not considered to be part of the preprocessor command.
If standard input is being viewed, the input preprocessor is passed a
file name consisting of a single dash. Similarly, if the first two
characters of LESSOPEN are vertical bar and dash (|-) or two vertical
bars and a dash (||-), the input pipe is used on standard input as well
as other files. Again, in this case the dash is not considered to be
part of the input pipe command.</p>

<p>A &#34;character set&#34; is simply a description of which characters are to be

<dt>

</dl>
<p>In rare cases, it may be desired to tailor <strong>less</strong> to use a character set
other than the ones definable by LESSCHARSET. In this case, the
environment variable LESSCHARDEF can be used to define a character set.
It should be set to a string where each character in the string
represents one character in the character set. The character &#34;.&#34; is used
for a normal character, &#34;c&#34; for control, and &#34;b&#34; for binary. A decimal
number may be used for repetition. For example, &#34;bccc4b.&#34; would mean
character 0 is binary, 1, 2 and 3 are control, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are binary,
and 8 is normal. All characters after the last are taken to be the same
as the last, so characters 9 through 255 would be normal. (This is an
example, and does not necessarily represent any real character set.)</p>

<p>
If neither LESSCHARSET nor LESSCHARDEF is set, but any of the strings
&#34;UTF-8&#34;, &#34;UTF8&#34;, &#34;utf-8&#34; or &#34;utf8&#34; is found in the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE or
LANG environment variables, then the default character set is utf-8.</p>
<p>
If that string is not found, but your system supports the <strong>setlocale</strong>
interface, <strong>less</strong> will use setlocale to determine the character set.
setlocale is controlled by setting the LANG or LC_CTYPE environment
variables.</p>
<p>
Finally, if the <em>setlocale</em> interface is also not available, the default
character set is utf-8.</p>
<p>
Control and binary characters are displayed in standout (reverse video).
Each such character is displayed in caret notation if possible (e.g. ^A
for control-A). Caret notation is used only if inverting the 0100 bit
results in a normal printable character. Otherwise, the character is
displayed as a hex number in angle brackets. This format can be changed
by setting the LESSBINFMT environment variable. LESSBINFMT may begin
with a &#34;*&#34; and one character to select the display attribute: &#34;*k&#34; is
blinking, &#34;<strong>d&#34; is bold, &#34;*u&#34; is underlined, &#34;*s&#34; is standout, and &#34;*n&#34;
is normal. If LESSBINFMT does not begin with a &#34;</strong>&#34;, normal attribute is
assumed. The remainder of LESSBINFMT is a string which may include one
printf-style escape sequence (a % followed by x, X, o, d, etc.). For
example, if LESSBINFMT is &#34;*u[%x]&#34;, binary characters are displayed in
underlined hexadecimal surrounded by brackets. The default if no
LESSBINFMT is specified is &#34;*s&lt;%02X&gt;&#34;. Warning: the result of expanding
the character via LESSBINFMT must be less than 31 characters.</p>
<p>
When the character set is utf-8, the LESSUTFBINFMT environment variable
acts similarly to LESSBINFMT but it applies to Unicode code points that
were successfully decoded but are unsuitable for display (e.g.,
unassigned code points). Its default value is &#34;&lt;U+%04lX&gt;&#34;. Note that
LESSUTFBINFMT and LESSBINFMT share their display attribute setting
(&#34;*x&#34;) so specifying one will affect both; LESSUTFBINFMT is read after
LESSBINFMT so its setting, if any, will have priority. Problematic
octets in a UTF-8 file (octets of a truncated sequence, octets of a
complete but non-shortest form sequence, invalid octets, and stray
trailing octets) are displayed individually using LESSBINFMT so as to
facilitate diagnostic of how the UTF-8 file is ill-formed.</p>
<p>
When the character set is utf-8, in rare cases it may be desirable to
override the Unicode definition of the type of certain characters. For
example, characters in a Private Use Area are normally treated as
control characters, but if you are using a custom font with printable
characters in that range, it may be desirable to tell <strong>less</strong> to treat
such characters as printable. This can be done by setting the
LESSUTFCHARDEF environment variable to a comma-separated list of
<em>character type</em> definitions. Each character type definition consists of
either one hexadecimal codepoint or a pair of codepoints separated by a
dash, followed by a colon and a type character. Each hexadecimal
codepoint may optionally be preceded by a &#34;U&#34; or &#34;U+&#34;. If a pair of
codepoints is given, the type is set for all characters inclusively
between the two values. If there are multiple comma-separated codepoint
values, they must be in ascending numerical order. The type character
may be one of:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li value="16">A normal printable character.</li>
<li>A wide (2-space) printable character.</li>
<li>A binary (non-printable) character.</li>
<li>A composing (zero width) character.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
For example, setting LESSUTFCHARDEF to</p>
<pre class="example">
	E000-F8FF:p,F0000-FFFFD:p,100000-10FFFD:p
</pre>
<p>
would make all Private Use Area characters be treated as printable.</p>

<p>If any item is unknown (for example, the file size if input is a pipe),
a question mark is printed instead.</p>
<p>
The format of the prompt string can be changed depending on certain
conditions. A question mark followed by a single character acts like an
&#34;IF&#34;: depending on the following character, a condition is evaluated. If
the condition is true, any characters following the question mark and
condition character, up to a period, are included in the prompt. If the
condition is false, such characters are not included. A colon appearing
between the question mark and the period can be used to establish an
&#34;ELSE&#34;: any characters between the colon and the period are included in
the string if and only if the IF condition is false. Condition
characters (which follow a question mark) may be:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
?a
</dt>
<dd>True if any characters have been included in the prompt so far.</dd>
<dt>
?bX
</dt>
<dd>True if the byte offset of the specified line is known.</dd>
<dt>
?B
</dt>
<dd>True if the size of current input file is known.</dd>
<dt>
?c
</dt>
<dd>True if the text is horizontally shifted (%c is not zero).</dd>
<dt>
?dX
</dt>
<dd>True if the page number of the specified line is known.</dd>
<dt>
?e
</dt>
<dd>True if at end-of-file.</dd>

?f
</dt>
<dd>True if there is an input filename (that is, if input is not a
pipe).</dd>

?lX
</dt>
<dd>True if the line number of the specified line is known.</dd>
<dt>
?L
</dt>
<dd>True if the line number of the last line in the file is known.</dd>
<dt>
?m
</dt>
<dd>True if there is more than one input file.</dd>
<dt>
?n
</dt>
<dd>True if this is the first prompt in a new input file.</dd>

?x

<dd>True if there is a next input file (that is, if the current
input file is not the last one).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Any characters other than the special ones (question mark, colon,
period, percent, and backslash) become literally part of the prompt. Any
of the special characters may be included in the prompt literally by
preceding it with a backslash.</p>
<p>
Some examples:</p>
<p>
?f%f:Standard input.</p>
<p>
This prompt prints the filename, if known; otherwise the string
&#34;Standard input&#34;.</p>
<p>
?f%f .?ltLine %lt:?pt%pt\%:?btByte %bt:-…</p>
<p>
This prompt would print the filename, if known. The filename is followed
by the line number, if known, otherwise the percent if known, otherwise
the byte offset if known. Otherwise, a dash is printed. Notice how each
question mark has a matching period, and how the % after the %pt is
included literally by escaping it with a backslash.</p>
<p>
?n?f%f .?m(%T %i of %m) ..?e(END) ?x- Next\: %x..%t</p>
<p>
This prints the filename if this is the first prompt in a file, followed
by the &#34;file N of N&#34; message if there is more than one input file. Then,
if we are at end-of-file, the string &#34;(END)&#34; is printed followed by the
name of the next file, if there is one. Finally, any trailing spaces are
truncated. This is the default prompt. For reference, here are the
defaults for the other two prompts (-m and -M respectively). Each is
broken into two lines here for readability only.</p>
<pre class="example">
?n?f%f .?m(%T %i of %m) ..?e(END) ?x- Next\: %x.:
	?pB%pB\%:byte %bB?s/%s...%t

?f%f .?n?m(%T %i of %m) ..?ltlines %lt-%lb?L/%L. :
	byte %bB?s/%s. .?e(END) ?x- Next\: %x.:?pB%pB\%..%t
</pre>
<p>
And here is the default message produced by the = command:</p>
<pre class="example">
?f%f .?m(%T %i of %m) .?ltlines %lt-%lb?L/%L. .
	byte %bB?s/%s. ?e(END) :?pB%pB\%..%t
</pre>
<p>
The prompt expansion features are also used for another purpose: if an
environment variable LESSEDIT is defined, it is used as the command to
be executed when the v command is invoked. The LESSEDIT string is
expanded in the same way as the prompt strings. The default value for
LESSEDIT is:</p>
<pre class="example">
	%E ?lm+%lm. %g
</pre>
<p>
Note that this expands to the editor name, followed by a + and the line
number, followed by the shell-escaped file name. If your editor does not
accept the &#34;+linenumber&#34; syntax, or has other differences in invocation
syntax, the LESSEDIT variable can be changed to modify this default.</p>

<dt>
LESS_COLUMNS
</dt>
<dd>Sets the number of columns on the screen. Unlike
COLUMNS, takes precedence over the system&#39;s idea of the screen size,
so it can be used to make <strong>less</strong> use less than the full screen width.
If set to a negative number, sets the number of columns used to this
much less than the actual screen width.</dd>
<dt>
LESS_LINES
</dt>
<dd>Sets the number of lines on the screen. Unlike LINES,
takes precedence over the system&#39;s idea of the screen size, so it can
be used to make <strong>less</strong> use less than the full screen height. If set to
a negative number, sets the number of lines used to this much less
than the actual screen height. When set, <strong>less</strong> repaints the entire
screen on every movement command, so scrolling may be slower.</dd>

that scheme.</dd>
<dt>
LESS_OSC8_ANY
</dt>
<dd>Sets an OSC 8 handler for opening OSC 8 links for
which there is no specific LESS_OSC8_xxx handler set for the &#34;xxx&#34;
scheme.</dd>
<dt>
LESS_TERMCAP_xx
</dt>
<dd>Where &#34;xx&#34; is any two characters, overrides the
definition of the termcap &#34;xx&#34; capability for the terminal.</dd>
<dt>
LESS_UNSUPPORT
</dt>
<dd>A space-separated list of command line options.
These options will be ignored (with no error message) if they appear
on the command line or in the LESS environment variable. Options
listed in LESS_UNSUPPORT can still be changed by the - and –
commands. Each option in LESS_UNSUPPORT is a dash followed by a single
character option letter, or two dashes followed by a long option name.</dd>
<dt>
LINES
</dt>
<dd>Sets the number of lines on the screen. Takes precedence over
the number of lines specified by the TERM variable. (But if you have a
windowing system which supports TIOCGWINSZ or WIOCGETD, the window
system&#39;s idea of the screen size takes precedence over the LINES and
COLUMNS environment variables.)</dd>
<dt>
MORE
</dt>
<dd>Options which are passed to <strong>less</strong> automatically when running
in <strong>more</strong>-compatible mode.</dd>
<dt>
PATH

<dd>The name of the editor (used for the v command).</dd>
<dt>
XDG_CONFIG_HOME
</dt>
<dd>Possible location of the <strong>lesskey</strong> file; see the
KEY BINDINGS section.</dd>
<dt>
XDG_DATA_HOME
</dt>
<dd>Possible location of the history file; see the
description of the LESSHISTFILE environment variable.</dd>
<dt>
XDG_STATE_HOME
</dt>
<dd>Possible location of the history file; see the
description of the LESSHISTFILE environment variable.</dd>
