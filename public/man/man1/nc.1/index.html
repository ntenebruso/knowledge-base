    <p>The</p>
<p>
(or</p>
<p>
utility is used for just about anything under the sun involving TCP,
UDP, or</p>
<p>
sockets. It can open TCP connections, send UDP packets, listen on
arbitrary TCP and UDP ports, do port scanning, and deal with both IPv4
and IPv6. Unlike</p>
<p>
scripts nicely, and separates error messages onto standard error instead
of sending them to standard output, as</p>
<p>
does with some.</p>
<p>
Common uses include:</p>
<p>
simple TCP proxies</p>
<p>
shell-script based HTTP clients and servers</p>
<p>
network daemon testing</p>
<p>
a SOCKS or HTTP ProxyCommand for</p>
<p>
and much, much more</p>
<p>
The options are as follows:</p>
<p>
Use IPv4 addresses only.</p>
<p>
Use IPv6 addresses only.</p>
<p>
Load the public key part of the TLS peer certificate from</p>
<p>
in PEM format. Requires</p>
<p>
Use TLS to connect or listen. Cannot be used together with any of the
options</p>
<p>
Enable debugging on the socket.</p>
<p>
Do not attempt to read from stdin.</p>
<p>
Only accept the TLS peer certificate if it contains the</p>
<p>
Requires</p>
<p>
If not specified,</p>
<p>
is used.</p>
<p>
Pass the first connected socket using</p>
<p>
to stdout and exit. This is useful in conjunction with</p>
<p>
to have</p>
<p>
perform connection setup with a proxy but then leave the rest of the
connection to another program (e.g.</p>
<p>
using the</p>
<p>
option). Cannot be used with</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
Only accept the TLS peer certificate if its hash returned from</p>
<p>
matches</p>
<p>
Requires</p>
<p>
and cannot be used with</p>
<p>
Print out the</p>
<p>
help text and exit.</p>
<p>
Specify the size of the TCP receive buffer.</p>
<p>
Sleep for</p>
<p>
seconds between lines of text sent and received. Also causes a delay
time between connections to multiple ports.</p>
<p>
Load the TLS private key from</p>
<p>
in PEM format. Requires</p>
<p>
When a connection is completed, listen for another one. Requires</p>
<p>
When used together with the</p>
<p>
option, the server socket is not connected and it can receive UDP
datagrams from multiple hosts.</p>
<p>
Listen for an incoming connection rather than initiating a connection to
a remote host. Cannot be used together with any of the options</p>
<p>
Additionally, any timeouts specified with the</p>
<p>
option are ignored.</p>
<p>
Set the TTL / hop limit of outgoing packets.</p>
<p>
Ask the kernel to drop incoming packets whose TTL / hop limit is under</p>
<p>
the network socket after EOF on the input. Some servers require this to
finish their work.</p>
<p>
Do not perform domain name resolution. If a name cannot be resolved
without DNS, an error will be reported.</p>
<p>
Specify the size of the TCP send buffer.</p>
<p>
During the TLS handshake, load data to be stapled from</p>
<p>
which is expected to contain an OCSP response from an OCSP server in DER
format. Requires</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
Specifies a username to present to a proxy server that requires
authentication. If no username is specified then authentication will not
be attempted. Proxy authentication is only supported for HTTP CONNECT
proxies at present.</p>
<p>
Specify the source port</p>
<p>
should use, subject to privilege restrictions and availability. Cannot
be used together with</p>
<p>
Load the root CA bundle for TLS certificate verification from</p>
<p>
in PEM format, instead of</p>
<p>
Requires</p>
<p>
Choose source and/or destination ports randomly instead of sequentially
within a range or in the order that the system assigns them.</p>
<p>
Enable the RFC 2385 TCP MD5 signature option.</p>
<p>
Set the source address to send packets from, which is useful on machines
with multiple interfaces. For</p>
<p>
datagram sockets, specifies the local temporary socket file to create
and use so that datagrams can be received. Cannot be used together with</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
Change the IPv4 TOS/IPv6 traffic class value or the TLS options.</p>
<p>
For TLS options,</p>
<p>
may be one of:</p>
<p>
which disables certificate verification;</p>
<p>
which disables certificate name checking;</p>
<p>
which requires a client certificate on incoming connections; or</p>
<p>
which requires the peer to provide a valid stapled OCSP response with
the handshake. The following TLS options specify a value in the form of
a</p>
<p>
pair:</p>
<p>
which allows the supported TLS ciphers to be specified (see</p>
<p>
for further details);</p>
<p>
which allows the supported TLS protocols to be specified (see</p>
<p>
for further details). Specifying TLS options requires</p>
<p>
For the IPv4 TOS/IPv6 traffic class value,</p>
<p>
may be one of</p>
<p>
or one of the DiffServ Code Points:</p>
<p>
or a number in either hex or decimal.</p>
<p>
Send RFC 854 DON&#39;T and WON&#39;T responses to RFC 854 DO and WILL requests.
This makes it possible to use</p>
<p>
to script telnet sessions.</p>
<p>
Use</p>
<p>
sockets. Cannot be used together with any of the options</p>
<p>
Use UDP instead of TCP. Cannot be used together with</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
For</p>
<p>
sockets, use a datagram socket instead of a stream socket. If a</p>
<p>
socket is used, a temporary receiving socket is created in</p>
<p>
unless the</p>
<p>
flag is given.</p>
<p>
Set the routing table to be used.</p>
<p>
Produce more verbose output.</p>
<p>
Terminate after receiving</p>
<p>
packets from the network.</p>
<p>
Connections which cannot be established or are idle timeout after</p>
<p>
seconds. The</p>
<p>
flag has no effect on the</p>
<p>
option, i.e.</p>
<p>
will listen forever for a connection, with or without the</p>
<p>
flag. The default is no timeout.</p>
<p>
Use</p>
<p>
when talking to the proxy server. Supported protocols are</p>
<p>
(SOCKS v.4),</p>
<p>
(SOCKS v.5) and</p>
<p>
(HTTPS proxy). If the protocol is not specified, SOCKS version 5 is
used.</p>
<p>
Connect to</p>
<p>
using a proxy at</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
If</p>
<p>
is not specified, the well-known port for the proxy protocol is used
(1080 for SOCKS, 3128 for HTTPS). An IPv6 address can be specified
unambiguously by enclosing</p>
<p>
in square brackets. A proxy cannot be used with any of the options</p>
<p>
Save the peer certificates to</p>
<p>
in PEM format. Requires</p>
<p>
Only scan for listening daemons, without sending any data to them.
Cannot be used together with</p>
<p>
can be a numerical IP address or a symbolic hostname (unless the</p>
<p>
option is given). In general, a destination must be specified, unless
the</p>
<p>
option is given (in which case the local host is used). For</p>
<p>
sockets, a destination is required and is the socket path to connect to
(or listen on if the</p>
<p>
option is given).</p>
<p>
can be specified as a numeric port number or as a service name. Port
ranges may be specified as numeric port numbers of the form</p>
<p>
In general, a destination port must be specified, unless the</p>
<p>
option is given. For some options, the value 0 requests that the system
choose a port number.</p>
<p>
It is quite simple to build a very basic client/server model using</p>
<p>
On one console, start</p>
<p>
listening on a specific port for a connection. For example:</p>
<p>
is now listening on port 1234 for a connection. On a second console</p>
<p>
connect to the machine and port being listened on:</p>
<p>
There should now be a connection between the ports. Anything typed at
the second console will be concatenated to the first, and vice-versa.
After the connection has been set up,</p>
<p>
does not really care which side is being used as a</p>
<p>
and which side is being used as a</p>
<p>
The connection may be terminated using an</p>
<p>
as the</p>
<p>
flag was given.</p>
<p>
The example in the previous section can be expanded to build a basic
data transfer model. Any information input into one end of the
connection will be output to the other end, and input and output can be
easily captured in order to emulate file transfer.</p>
<p>
Start by using</p>
<p>
to listen on a specific port, with output captured into a file:</p>
<p>
Using a second machine, connect to the listening</p>
<p>
process, feeding it the file which is to be transferred:</p>
<p>
After the file has been transferred, the connection will close
automatically.</p>
<p>
It is sometimes useful to talk to servers</p>
<p>
rather than through a user interface. It can aid in troubleshooting,
when it might be necessary to verify what data a server is sending in
response to commands issued by the client. For example, to retrieve the
home page of a web site:</p>
<p>
$ printf &#34;GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n&#34; | nc host.example.com 80</p>
<p>
Note that this also displays the headers sent by the web server. They
can be filtered, using a tool such as</p>
<p>
if necessary.</p>
<p>
More complicated examples can be built up when the user knows the format
of requests required by the server. As another example, an email may be
submitted to an SMTP server using:</p>
<p>
$ nc localhost 25 &lt;&lt; EOF HELO host.example.com MAIL
FROM:&lt;user@host.example.com&gt; RCPT TO:&lt;user2@host.example.com&gt; DATA Body
of email. . QUIT EOF</p>
<p>
It may be useful to know which ports are open and running services on a
target machine. The</p>
<p>
flag can be used to tell</p>
<p>
to report open ports, rather than initiate a connection. For example:</p>
<p>
$ nc -z host.example.com 20-30 Connection to host.example.com 22 port
[tcp/ssh] succeeded! Connection to host.example.com 25 port [tcp/smtp]
succeeded!</p>
<p>
The port range was specified to limit the search to ports 20 - 30.</p>
<p>
Alternatively, it might be useful to know which server software is
running, and which versions. This information is often contained within
the greeting banners. In order to retrieve these, it is necessary to
first make a connection, and then break the connection when the banner
has been retrieved. This can be accomplished by specifying a small
timeout with the</p>
<p>
flag, or perhaps by issuing a</p>
<p>
command to the server:</p>
<p>
$ echo &#34;QUIT&#34; | nc host.example.com 20-30 SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_3.6.1p2
Protocol mismatch. 220 host.example.com IMS SMTP Receiver Version 0.84
Ready</p>
<p>
Open a TCP connection to port 42 of host.example.com, using port 31337
as the source port, with a timeout of 5 seconds:</p>
<p>
Open a TCP connection to port 443 of www.example.com, and negotiate TLS
with any supported TLS protocol version and &#34;compat&#34; ciphers:</p>
<p>
Open a TCP connection to port 443 of www.google.ca, and negotiate TLS.
Check for a different name in the certificate for validation:</p>
<p>
Open a UDP connection to port 53 of host.example.com:</p>
<p>
Open a TCP connection to port 42 of host.example.com using 10.1.2.3 as
the IP for the local end of the connection:</p>
<p>
Create and listen on a</p>
<p>
stream socket:</p>
<p>
Connect to port 42 of host.example.com via an HTTP proxy at 10.2.3.4,
port 8080. This example could also be used by</p>
<p>
see the</p>
<p>
directive in</p>
<p>
for more information.</p>
<p>
The same example again, this time enabling proxy authentication with
username</p>
<p>
if the proxy requires it:</p>
<p>
Original implementation by</p>
<p>
\\
Rewritten with IPv6 support by</p>
<p>
UDP port scans using the</p>
<p>
combination of flags will always report success irrespective of the
target machine&#39;s state. However, in conjunction with a traffic sniffer
either on the target machine or an intermediary device, the</p>
<p>
combination could be useful for communications diagnostics. Note that
the amount of UDP traffic generated may be limited either due to
hardware resources and/or configuration settings.</p>
