DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>If <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong> is specified, <strong>git rebase</strong> will perform an automatic <strong>git
switch &lt;branch&gt;</strong> before doing anything else. Otherwise it remains on the
current branch.</p>
<p>
If <strong>&lt;upstream&gt;</strong> is not specified, the upstream configured in
<strong>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</strong> and <strong>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</strong> options will be used
(see <strong>git-config*(1) for details) and the *–fork-point</strong> option is
assumed. If you are currently not on any branch or if the current branch
does not have a configured upstream, the rebase will abort.</p>
<p>
All changes made by commits in the current branch but that are not in
<strong>&lt;upstream&gt;</strong> are saved to a temporary area. This is the same set of
commits that would be shown by <strong>git log &lt;upstream&gt;..HEAD</strong>; or by <strong>git
log fork_point..HEAD</strong>, if <strong>–fork-point</strong> is active (see the description
on <strong>–fork-point</strong> below); or by <strong>git log HEAD</strong>, if the <strong>–root</strong> option
is specified.</p>
<p>
The current branch is reset to <strong>&lt;upstream&gt;</strong> or <strong>&lt;newbase&gt;</strong> if the
<strong>–onto</strong> option was supplied. This has the exact same effect as <strong>git
reset –hard &lt;upstream&gt;</strong> (or <strong>&lt;newbase&gt;</strong>). <strong>ORIG_HEAD</strong> is set to point
at the tip of the branch before the reset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\\</p>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>
\\</p>
<p>
<strong>ORIG_HEAD</strong> is not guaranteed to still point to the previous branch tip
at the end of the rebase if other commands that write that pseudo-ref
(e.g. <strong>git reset</strong>) are used during the rebase. The previous branch tip,
however, is accessible using the reflog of the current branch (i.e.
<strong>@{1}</strong>, see *gitrevisions*(7)).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The commits that were previously saved into the temporary area are then
reapplied to the current branch, one by one, in order. Note that any
commits in <strong>HEAD</strong> which introduce the same textual changes as a commit
in <strong>HEAD..&lt;upstream&gt;</strong> are omitted (i.e., a patch already accepted
upstream with a different commit message or timestamp will be skipped).</p>
<p>
It is possible that a merge failure will prevent this process from being
completely automatic. You will have to resolve any such merge failure
and run <strong>git rebase –continue</strong>. Another option is to bypass the commit
that caused the merge failure with <strong>git rebase –skip</strong>. To check out the
original <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong> and remove the <strong>.git/rebase-apply</strong> working files,
use the command <strong>git rebase –abort</strong> instead.</p>
<p>
Assume the following history exists and the current branch is &#34;topic&#34;:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          A---B---C topic
         /
    D---E---F---G master
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
From this point, the result of either of the following commands:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git rebase master
git rebase master topic
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
                  A--B--C topic
                 /
    D---E---F---G master
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> The latter form is just a short-hand of <strong>git checkout topic</strong>
followed by <strong>git rebase master</strong>. When rebase exits <strong>topic</strong> will remain
the checked-out branch.</p>
<p>
If the upstream branch already contains a change you have made (e.g.,
because you mailed a patch which was applied upstream), then that commit
will be skipped and warnings will be issued (if the <em>merge</em> backend is
used). For example, running <strong>git rebase master</strong> on the following history
(in which <strong>A</strong> and <strong>A</strong> introduce the same set of changes, but have
different committer information):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          A---B---C topic
         /
    D---E---A---F master
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
will result in:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
                   B---C topic
                  /
    D---E---A---F master
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here is how you would transplant a topic branch based on one branch to
another, to pretend that you forked the topic branch from the latter
branch, using <strong>rebase –onto</strong>.</p>
<p>
First let&#39;s assume your <em>topic</em> is based on branch <em>next</em>. For example,
a feature developed in <em>topic</em> depends on some functionality which is
found in <em>next</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
    o---o---o---o---o  master
         \
          o---o---o---o---o  next
                           \
                            o---o---o  topic
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
We want to make <em>topic</em> forked from branch <em>master</em>; for example,
because the functionality on which <em>topic</em> depends was merged into the
more stable <em>master</em> branch. We want our tree to look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
    o---o---o---o---o  master
        |            \
        |             o--o--o  topic
         \
          o---o---o---o---o  next
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
We can get this using the following command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git rebase --onto master next topic
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Another example of –onto option is to rebase part of a branch. If we
have the following situation:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
                            H---I---J topicB
                           /
                  E---F---G  topicA
                 /
    A---B---C---D  master
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
then the command</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git rebase --onto master topicA topicB
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
would result in:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
                 H--I--J  topicB
                /
                | E---F---G  topicA
                |/
    A---B---C---D  master
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is useful when topicB does not depend on topicA.</p>
<p>
A range of commits could also be removed with rebase. If we have the
following situation:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
    E---F---G---H---I---J  topicA
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
then the command</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git rebase --onto topicA~5 topicA~3 topicA
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
would result in the removal of commits F and G:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
    E---H---I---J  topicA
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is useful if F and G were flawed in some way, or should not be part
of topicA. Note that the argument to <strong>–onto</strong> and the <strong>&lt;upstream&gt;</strong>
parameter can be any valid commit-ish.</p>
<p>
In case of conflict, <strong>git rebase</strong> will stop at the first problematic
commit and leave conflict markers in the tree. You can use <strong>git diff</strong> to
locate the markers (&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;) and make edits to resolve the conflict. For
each file you edit, you need to tell Git that the conflict has been
resolved, typically this would be done with</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git add &lt;filename&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
After resolving the conflict manually and updating the index with the
desired resolution, you can continue the rebasing process with</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git rebase --continue
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Alternatively, you can undo the <em>git rebase</em> with</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git rebase --abort
</pre>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>–onto &lt;newbase&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting point at which to create the new commits. If the <strong>–onto</strong>
option is not specified, the starting point is <strong>&lt;upstream&gt;</strong>. May be any
valid commit, and not just an existing branch name.</p>
<p>
As a special case, you may use &#34;A…B&#34; as a shortcut for the merge base
of A and B if there is exactly one merge base. You can leave out at most
one of A and B, in which case it defaults to HEAD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–keep-base</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the starting point at which to create the new commits to the merge
base of <strong>&lt;upstream&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong>. Running <strong>git rebase –keep-base
&lt;upstream&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</strong> is equivalent to running *git rebase
–reapply-cherry-picks –no-fork-point –onto &lt;upstream&gt;…&lt;branch&gt;
&lt;upstream&gt; &lt;branch&gt;*.</p>
<p>
This option is useful in the case where one is developing a feature on
top of an upstream branch. While the feature is being worked on, the
upstream branch may advance and it may not be the best idea to keep
rebasing on top of the upstream but to keep the base commit as-is. As
the base commit is unchanged this option implies
<strong>–reapply-cherry-picks</strong> to avoid losing commits.</p>
<p>
Although both this option and <strong>–fork-point</strong> find the merge base between
<strong>&lt;upstream&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong>, this option uses the merge base as the
<em>starting point</em> on which new commits will be created, whereas
<strong>–fork-point</strong> uses the merge base to determine the <em>set of commits</em>
which will be rebased.</p>
<p>
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;upstream&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upstream branch to compare against. May be any valid commit, not just an
existing branch name. Defaults to the configured upstream for the
current branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;branch&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Working branch; defaults to <strong>HEAD</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–apply</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use applying strategies to rebase (calling <strong>git-am</strong> internally). This
option may become a no-op in the future once the merge backend handles
everything the apply one does.</p>
<p>
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–empty=(drop|keep|stop)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How to handle commits that are not empty to start and are not clean
cherry-picks of any upstream commit, but which become empty after
rebasing (because they contain a subset of already upstream changes):</p>
<p>
<strong>drop</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The commit will be dropped. This is the default behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>keep</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The commit will be kept. This option is implied when <strong>–exec</strong> is
specified unless <strong>-i*/</strong>–interactive* is also specified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>stop</strong>, <strong>ask</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rebase will halt when the commit is applied, allowing you to choose
whether to drop it, edit files more, or just commit the empty changes.
This option is implied when <strong>-i*/</strong>–interactive* is specified. <strong>ask</strong> is
a deprecated synonym of <strong>stop</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that commits which start empty are kept (unless <strong>–no-keep-empty</strong>
is specified), and commits which are clean cherry-picks (as determined
by <strong>git log –cherry-mark …</strong>) are detected and dropped as a
preliminary step (unless <strong>–reapply-cherry-picks</strong> or <strong>–keep-base</strong> is
passed).</p>
<p>
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-keep-empty, –keep-empty</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not keep commits that start empty before the rebase (i.e. that do not
change anything from its parent) in the result. The default is to keep
commits which start empty, since creating such commits requires passing
the <strong>–allow-empty</strong> override flag to <strong>git commit</strong>, signifying that a
user is very intentionally creating such a commit and thus wants to keep
it.</p>
<p>
Usage of this flag will probably be rare, since you can get rid of
commits that start empty by just firing up an interactive rebase and
removing the lines corresponding to the commits you don&#39;t want. This
flag exists as a convenient shortcut, such as for cases where external
tools generate many empty commits and you want them all removed.</p>
<p>
For commits which do not start empty but become empty after rebasing,
see the <strong>–empty</strong> flag.</p>
<p>
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–reapply-cherry-picks, –no-reapply-cherry-picks</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reapply all clean cherry-picks of any upstream commit instead of
preemptively dropping them. (If these commits then become empty after
rebasing, because they contain a subset of already upstream changes, the
behavior towards them is controlled by the <strong>–empty</strong> flag.)</p>
<p>
In the absence of <strong>–keep-base</strong> (or if <strong>–no-reapply-cherry-picks</strong> is
given), these commits will be automatically dropped. Because this
necessitates reading all upstream commits, this can be expensive in
repositories with a large number of upstream commits that need to be
read. When using the <em>merge</em> backend, warnings will be issued for each
dropped commit (unless <strong>–quiet</strong> is given). Advice will also be issued
unless <strong>advice.skippedCherryPicks</strong> is set to false (see
*git-config*(1)).</p>
<p>
<strong>–reapply-cherry-picks</strong> allows rebase to forgo reading all upstream
commits, potentially improving performance.</p>
<p>
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–allow-empty-message</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No-op. Rebasing commits with an empty message used to fail and this
option would override that behavior, allowing commits with empty
messages to be rebased. Now commits with an empty message do not cause
rebasing to halt.</p>
<p>
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-m, –merge</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using merging strategies to rebase (default).</p>
<p>
Note that a rebase merge works by replaying each commit from the working
branch on top of the <strong>&lt;upstream&gt;</strong> branch. Because of this, when a merge
conflict happens, the side reported as <em>ours</em> is the so-far rebased
series, starting with <strong>&lt;upstream&gt;</strong>, and <em>theirs</em> is the working branch.
In other words, the sides are swapped.</p>
<p>
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-s &lt;strategy&gt;, –strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the given merge strategy, instead of the default <strong>ort</strong>. This implies
<strong>–merge</strong>.</p>
<p>
Because <strong>git rebase</strong> replays each commit from the working branch on top
of the <strong>&lt;upstream&gt;</strong> branch using the given strategy, using the <strong>ours</strong>
strategy simply empties all patches from the <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong>, which makes
little sense.</p>
<p>
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-X &lt;strategy-option&gt;, –strategy-option=&lt;strategy-option&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pass the &lt;strategy-option&gt; through to the merge strategy. This implies
<strong>–merge</strong> and, if no strategy has been specified, <strong>-s ort</strong>. Note the
reversal of <em>ours</em> and <em>theirs</em> as noted above for the <strong>-m</strong> option.</p>
<p>
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–rerere-autoupdate, –no-rerere-autoupdate</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the rerere mechanism reuses a recorded resolution on the current
conflict to update the files in the working tree, allow it to also
update the index with the result of resolution. <strong>–no-rerere-autoupdate</strong>
is a good way to double-check what <strong>rerere</strong> did and catch potential
mismerges, before committing the result to the index with a separate
<strong>git add</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-S[&lt;keyid&gt;], –gpg-sign[=&lt;keyid&gt;], –no-gpg-sign</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GPG-sign commits. The <strong>keyid</strong> argument is optional and defaults to the
committer identity; if specified, it must be stuck to the option without
a space. <strong>–no-gpg-sign</strong> is useful to countermand both <strong>commit.gpgSign</strong>
configuration variable, and earlier <strong>–gpg-sign</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Individually replay all rebased commits instead of fast-forwarding over
the unchanged ones. This ensures that the entire history of the rebased
branch is composed of new commits.</p>
<p>
You may find this helpful after reverting a topic branch merge, as this
option recreates the topic branch with fresh commits so it can be
remerged successfully without needing to &#34;revert the reversion&#34; (see the

When <strong>–fork-point</strong> is active, <em>fork_point</em> will be used instead of
<strong>&lt;upstream&gt;</strong> to calculate the set of commits to rebase, where
<em>fork_point</em> is the result of <strong>git merge-base –fork-point &lt;upstream&gt;

<p>
-r, –rebase-merges[=(rebase-cousins|no-rebase-cousins)],
–no-rebase-merges</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, a rebase will simply drop merge commits from the todo list,
and put the rebased commits into a single, linear branch. With
<strong>–rebase-merges</strong>, the rebase will instead try to preserve the branching
structure within the commits that are to be rebased, by recreating the
merge commits. Any resolved merge conflicts or manual amendments in
these merge commits will have to be resolved/re-applied manually.
<strong>–no-rebase-merges</strong> can be used to countermand both the
<strong>rebase.rebaseMerges</strong> config option and a previous <strong>–rebase-merges</strong>.</p>
<p>
When rebasing merges, there are two modes: <strong>rebase-cousins</strong> and
<strong>no-rebase-cousins</strong>. If the mode is not specified, it defaults to
<strong>no-rebase-cousins</strong>. In <strong>no-rebase-cousins</strong> mode, commits which do not
have <strong>&lt;upstream&gt;</strong> as direct ancestor will keep their original branch
point, i.e. commits that would be excluded by <strong>git-log*(1)s
*–ancestry-path</strong> option will keep their original ancestry by default.
In <strong>rebase-cousins</strong> mode, such commits are instead rebased onto
<strong>&lt;upstream&gt;</strong> (or <strong>&lt;onto&gt;</strong>, if specified).</p>
<p>
It is currently only possible to recreate the merge commits using the
<strong>ort</strong> merge strategy; different merge strategies can be used only via
explicit <strong>exec git merge -s &lt;strategy&gt; […]</strong> commands.</p>
<p>
See also REBASING MERGES and INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-x &lt;cmd&gt;, –exec &lt;cmd&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Append &#34;exec &lt;cmd&gt;&#34; after each line creating a commit in the final
history. <strong>&lt;cmd&gt;</strong> will be interpreted as one or more shell commands. Any
command that fails will interrupt the rebase, with exit code 1.</p>
<p>
You may execute several commands by either using one instance of
<strong>–exec</strong> with several commands:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git rebase -i --exec &#34;cmd1 &amp;&amp; cmd2 &amp;&amp; ...&#34;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
or by giving more than one <strong>–exec</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git rebase -i --exec &#34;cmd1&#34; --exec &#34;cmd2&#34; --exec ...
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If <strong>–autosquash</strong> is used, <strong>exec</strong> lines will not be appended for the
intermediate commits, and will only appear at the end of each
squash/fixup series.</p>
<p>
This uses the <strong>–interactive</strong> machinery internally, but it can be run
without an explicit <strong>–interactive</strong>.</p>
<p>
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–root</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rebase all commits reachable from <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong>, instead of limiting them
with an <strong>&lt;upstream&gt;</strong>. This allows you to rebase the root commit(s) on a
branch.</p>
<p>
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–autosquash, –no-autosquash</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Automatically squash commits with specially formatted messages into
previous commits being rebased. If a commit message starts with &#34;squash!
&#34;, &#34;fixup! &#34; or &#34;amend! &#34;, the remainder of the subject line is taken as
a commit specifier, which matches a previous commit if it matches the
subject line or the hash of that commit. If no commit matches fully,
matches of the specifier with the start of commit subjects are
considered.</p>
<p>
In the rebase todo list, the actions of squash, fixup and amend commits
are changed from <strong>pick</strong> to <strong>squash</strong>, <strong>fixup</strong> or <strong>fixup -C</strong>,
respectively, and they are moved right after the commit they modify. The
<strong>–interactive</strong> option can be used to review and edit the todo list
before proceeding.</p>
<p>
The recommended way to create commits with squash markers is by using
the <strong>–squash</strong>, <strong>–fixup</strong>, <strong>–fixup=amend:</strong> or <strong>–fixup=reword:</strong> options
of *git-commit*(1), which take the target commit as an argument and
automatically fill in the subject line of the new commit from that.</p>
<p>
Setting configuration variable <strong>rebase.autoSquash</strong> to true enables
auto-squashing by default for interactive rebase. The <strong>–no-autosquash</strong>
option can be used to override that setting.</p>
<p>
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–autostash, –no-autostash</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Automatically create a temporary stash entry before the operation
begins, and apply it after the operation ends. This means that you can
run rebase on a dirty worktree. However, use with care: the final stash
application after a successful rebase might result in non-trivial
conflicts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–reschedule-failed-exec, –no-reschedule-failed-exec</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Automatically reschedule <strong>exec</strong> commands that failed. This only makes
sense in interactive mode (or when an <strong>–exec</strong> option was provided).</p>
<p>
This option applies once a rebase is started. It is preserved for the
whole rebase based on, in order, the command line option provided to the
initial <strong>git rebase</strong>, the <strong>rebase.rescheduleFailedExec</strong> configuration
(see *git-config*(1) or &#34;CONFIGURATION&#34; below), or it defaults to false.</p>
<p>
Recording this option for the whole rebase is a convenience feature.
Otherwise an explicit <strong>–no-reschedule-failed-exec</strong> at the start would
be overridden by the presence of a <strong>rebase.rescheduleFailedExec=true</strong>
configuration when <strong>git rebase –continue</strong> is invoked. Currently, you
cannot pass <strong>–[no-]reschedule-failed-exec</strong> to <strong>git rebase –continue</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–update-refs, –no-update-refs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Automatically force-update any branches that point to commits that are
being rebased. Any branches that are checked out in a worktree are not
updated in this way.</p>
<p>
If the configuration variable <strong>rebase.updateRefs</strong> is set, then this
option can be used to override and disable this setting.</p>

BEHAVIORAL DIFFERENCES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>git rebase</strong> has two primary backends: <em>apply</em> and <em>merge</em>. (The <em>apply</em>
backend used to be known as the <em>am</em> backend, but the name led to
confusion as it looks like a verb instead of a noun. Also, the <em>merge</em>
backend used to be known as the interactive backend, but it is now used
for non-interactive cases as well. Both were renamed based on
lower-level functionality that underpinned each.) There are some subtle
differences in how these two backends behave:</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-8">
Empty commits
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The <em>apply</em> backend unfortunately drops intentionally empty commits,
i.e. commits that started empty, though these are rare in practice. It
also drops commits that become empty and has no option for controlling
this behavior.</p>
<p>
The <em>merge</em> backend keeps intentionally empty commits by default (though
with <strong>-i</strong> they are marked as empty in the todo list editor, or they can
be dropped automatically with <strong>–no-keep-empty</strong>).</p>
<p>
Similar to the apply backend, by default the merge backend drops commits
that become empty unless <strong>-i*/</strong>–interactive* is specified (in which
case it stops and asks the user what to do). The merge backend also has
an <strong>–empty=(drop|keep|stop)</strong> option for changing the behavior of
handling commits that become empty.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-9">
Directory rename detection
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Due to the lack of accurate tree information (arising from constructing
fake ancestors with the limited information available in patches),
directory rename detection is disabled in the <em>apply</em> backend. Disabled
directory rename detection means that if one side of history renames a
directory and the other adds new files to the old directory, then the
new files will be left behind in the old directory without any warning
at the time of rebasing that you may want to move these files into the
new directory.</p>
<p>
Directory rename detection works with the <em>merge</em> backend to provide you
warnings in such cases.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-10" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-10">
Context
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The <em>apply</em> backend works by creating a sequence of patches (by calling
<strong>format-patch</strong> internally), and then applying the patches in sequence
(calling <strong>am</strong> internally). Patches are composed of multiple hunks, each
with line numbers, a context region, and the actual changes. The line
numbers have to be taken with some offset, since the other side will
likely have inserted or deleted lines earlier in the file. The context
region is meant to help find how to adjust the line numbers in order to
apply the changes to the right lines. However, if multiple areas of the
code have the same surrounding lines of context, the wrong one can be
picked. There are real-world cases where this has caused commits to be
reapplied incorrectly with no conflicts reported. Setting <strong>diff.context</strong>
to a larger value may prevent such types of problems, but increases the
chance of spurious conflicts (since it will require more lines of
matching context to apply).</p>
<p>
The <em>merge</em> backend works with a full copy of each relevant file,
insulating it from these types of problems.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-11" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-11">
Labelling of conflicts markers
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-3">
<p>When there are content conflicts, the merge machinery tries to annotate
each side&#39;s conflict markers with the commits where the content came
from. Since the <em>apply</em> backend drops the original information about the
rebased commits and their parents (and instead generates new fake
commits based off limited information in the generated patches), those
commits cannot be identified; instead it has to fall back to a commit
summary. Also, when <strong>merge.conflictStyle</strong> is set to <strong>diff3</strong> or <strong>zdiff3</strong>,
the <em>apply</em> backend will use &#34;constructed merge base&#34; to label the
content from the merge base, and thus provide no information about the
merge base commit whatsoever.</p>
<p>
The <em>merge</em> backend works with the full commits on both sides of history
and thus has no such limitations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-12" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-12">
Hooks
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The <em>apply</em> backend has not traditionally called the post-commit hook,
while the <em>merge</em> backend has. Both have called the post-checkout hook,
though the <em>merge</em> backend has squelched its output. Further, both
backends only call the post-checkout hook with the starting point commit
of the rebase, not the intermediate commits nor the final commit. In
each case, the calling of these hooks was by accident of implementation
rather than by design (both backends were originally implemented as
shell scripts and happened to invoke other commands like <strong>git checkout</strong>
or <strong>git commit</strong> that would call the hooks). Both backends should have
the same behavior, though it is not entirely clear which, if any, is
correct. We will likely make rebase stop calling either of these hooks
in the future.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-13" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-13">
Interruptability
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The <em>apply</em> backend has safety problems with an ill-timed interrupt; if
the user presses Ctrl-C at the wrong time to try to abort the rebase,
the rebase can enter a state where it cannot be aborted with a
subsequent <strong>git rebase –abort</strong>. The <em>merge</em> backend does not appear to
suffer from the same shortcoming. (See
<strong><a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200207132152.GC2868@szeder.dev/">https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200207132152.GC2868@szeder.dev/</a></strong> for

Commit Rewording
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-3">
<p>When a conflict occurs while rebasing, rebase stops and asks the user to
resolve. Since the user may need to make notable changes while resolving
conflicts, after conflicts are resolved and the user has run <strong>git rebase
–continue</strong>, the rebase should open an editor and ask the user to update
the commit message. The <em>merge</em> backend does this, while the <em>apply</em>
backend blindly applies the original commit message.</p>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-15" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-15">
Miscellaneous differences
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-3">
<p>There are a few more behavioral differences that most folks would
probably consider inconsequential but which are mentioned for
completeness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Reflog: The two backends will use different wording when describing the
changes made in the reflog, though both will make use of the word
&#34;rebase&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Progress, informational, and error messages: The two backends provide
slightly different progress and informational messages. Also, the apply
backend writes error messages (such as &#34;Your files would be
overwritten…&#34;) to stdout, while the merge backend writes them to
stderr.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
State directories: The two backends keep their state in different
directories under <strong>.git/</strong></p>

MERGE STRATEGIES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-16" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The merge mechanism (<strong>git merge</strong> and <strong>git pull</strong> commands) allows the
backend <em>merge strategies</em> to be chosen with <strong>-s</strong> option. Some
strategies can also take their own options, which can be passed by
giving <strong>-X&lt;option&gt;</strong> arguments to <strong>git merge</strong> and/or <strong>git pull</strong>.</p>
<p>
ort</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one branch.
This strategy can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge algorithm.
When there is more than one common ancestor that can be used for 3-way
merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as
the reference tree for the 3-way merge. This has been reported to result
in fewer merge conflicts without causing mismerges by tests done on
actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history.
Additionally this strategy can detect and handle merges involving
renames. It does not make use of detected copies. The name for this
algorithm is an acronym (&#34;Ostensibly Recursive&#39;s Twin&#34;) and came from
the fact that it was written as a replacement for the previous default
algorithm, <strong>recursive</strong>.</p>
<p>
The <em>ort</em> strategy can take the following options:</p>
<p>
ours</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved cleanly by
favoring <em>our</em> version. Changes from the other tree that do not conflict
with our side are reflected in the merge result. For a binary file, the
entire contents are taken from our side.</p>
<p>
This should not be confused with the <em>ours</em> merge strategy, which does
not even look at what the other tree contains at all. It discards
everything the other tree did, declaring <em>our</em> history contains all that
happened in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
theirs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the opposite of <em>ours</em>; note that, unlike <em>ours</em>, there is no
<em>theirs</em> merge strategy to confuse this merge option with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
ignore-space-change, ignore-all-space, ignore-space-at-eol,
ignore-cr-at-eol</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Treats lines with the indicated type of whitespace change as unchanged
for the sake of a three-way merge. Whitespace changes mixed with other
changes to a line are not ignored. See also <strong>git-diff*(1) *-b</strong>, <strong>-w</strong>,
<strong>–ignore-space-at-eol</strong>, and <strong>–ignore-cr-at-eol</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
If <em>their</em> version only introduces whitespace changes to a line, <em>our</em>
version is used;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
If <em>our</em> version introduces whitespace changes but <em>their</em> version
includes a substantial change, <em>their</em> version is used;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Otherwise, the merge proceeds in the usual way.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
renormalize</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This runs a virtual check-out and check-in of all three stages of a file
when resolving a three-way merge. This option is meant to be used when
merging branches with different clean filters or end-of-line
normalization rules. See &#34;Merging branches with differing
checkin/checkout attributes&#34; in *gitattributes*(5) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
no-renormalize</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disables the <strong>renormalize</strong> option. This overrides the
<strong>merge.renormalize</strong> configuration variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn on rename detection, optionally setting the similarity threshold.
This is the default. This overrides the <em>merge.renames</em> configuration
variable. See also <strong>git-diff*(1) *–find-renames</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
rename-threshold=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deprecated synonym for <strong>find-renames=&lt;n&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
subtree[=&lt;path&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is a more advanced form of <em>subtree</em> strategy, where the
strategy makes a guess on how two trees must be shifted to match with
each other when merging. Instead, the specified path is prefixed (or
stripped from the beginning) to make the shape of two trees to match.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
recursive</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge algorithm. When
there is more than one common ancestor that can be used for 3-way merge,
it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the
reference tree for the 3-way merge. This has been reported to result in
fewer merge conflicts without causing mismerges by tests done on actual
merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history.
Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving renames. It
does not make use of detected copies. This was the default strategy for
resolving two heads from Git v0.99.9k until v2.33.0.</p>
<p>
The <em>recursive</em> strategy takes the same options as <em>ort</em>. However, there
are three additional options that <em>ort</em> ignores (not documented above)
that are potentially useful with the <em>recursive</em> strategy:</p>
<p>
patience</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deprecated synonym for <strong>diff-algorithm=patience</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff-algorithm=[patience|minimal|histogram|myers]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use a different diff algorithm while merging, which can help avoid
mismerges that occur due to unimportant matching lines (such as braces
from distinct functions). See also <strong>git-diff*(1) *–diff-algorithm</strong>.
Note that <strong>ort</strong> specifically uses <strong>diff-algorithm=histogram</strong>, while
<strong>recursive</strong> defaults to the <strong>diff.algorithm</strong> config setting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
no-renames</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn off rename detection. This overrides the <strong>merge.renames</strong>
configuration variable. See also <strong>git-diff*(1) *–no-renames</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
resolve</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch and another
branch you pulled from) using a 3-way merge algorithm. It tries to
carefully detect criss-cross merge ambiguities. It does not handle
renames.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
octopus</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses to do a
complex merge that needs manual resolution. It is primarily meant to be
used for bundling topic branch heads together. This is the default merge
strategy when pulling or merging more than one branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
ours</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree of the merge
is always that of the current branch head, effectively ignoring all
changes from all other branches. It is meant to be used to supersede old
development history of side branches. Note that this is different from
the -Xours option to the <em>recursive</em> merge strategy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
subtree</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a modified <strong>ort</strong> strategy. When merging trees A and B, if B
corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to match the tree
structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same level. This
adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
With the strategies that use 3-way merge (including the default, <em>ort</em>),
if a change is made on both branches, but later reverted on one of the
branches, that change will be present in the merged result; some people
find this behavior confusing. It occurs because only the heads and the
merge base are considered when performing a merge, not the individual
commits. The merge algorithm therefore considers the reverted change as
no change at all, and substitutes the changed version instead.</p>

<p>You should understand the implications of using <strong>git rebase</strong> on a

<p>
When the rebase is run, it will first execute a <strong>pre-rebase</strong> hook if one

INTERACTIVE MODE
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-18" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Rebasing interactively means that you have a chance to edit the commits
which are rebased. You can reorder the commits, and you can remove them
(weeding out bad or otherwise unwanted patches).</p>
<p>
The interactive mode is meant for this type of workflow:</p>

<p>
Sometimes the thing fixed in b.2. cannot be amended to the not-quite
perfect commit it fixes, because that commit is buried deeply in a patch
series. That is exactly what interactive rebase is for: use it after
plenty of &#34;a&#34;s and &#34;b&#34;s, by rearranging and editing commits, and
squashing multiple commits into one.</p>
<p>
Start it with the last commit you want to retain as-is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git rebase -i &lt;after-this-commit&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
An editor will be fired up with all the commits in your current branch
(ignoring merge commits), which come after the given commit. You can
reorder the commits in this list to your heart&#39;s content, and you can
remove them. The list looks more or less like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
pick deadbee The oneline of this commit
pick fa1afe1 The oneline of the next commit
...
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The oneline descriptions are purely for your pleasure; <em>git rebase</em> will
not look at them but at the commit names (&#34;deadbee&#34; and &#34;fa1afe1&#34; in
this example), so do not delete or edit the names.</p>
<p>
By replacing the command &#34;pick&#34; with the command &#34;edit&#34;, you can tell
<strong>git rebase</strong> to stop after applying that commit, so that you can edit
the files and/or the commit message, amend the commit, and continue
rebasing.</p>
<p>
To interrupt the rebase (just like an &#34;edit&#34; command would do, but
without cherry-picking any commit first), use the &#34;break&#34; command.</p>
<p>
If you just want to edit the commit message for a commit, replace the
command &#34;pick&#34; with the command &#34;reword&#34;.</p>
<p>
To drop a commit, replace the command &#34;pick&#34; with &#34;drop&#34;, or just delete
the matching line.</p>
<p>
If you want to fold two or more commits into one, replace the command
&#34;pick&#34; for the second and subsequent commits with &#34;squash&#34; or &#34;fixup&#34;.
If the commits had different authors, the folded commit will be
attributed to the author of the first commit. The suggested commit
message for the folded commit is the concatenation of the first commit&#39;s
message with those identified by &#34;squash&#34; commands, omitting the
messages of commits identified by &#34;fixup&#34; commands, unless &#34;fixup -c&#34; is
used. In that case the suggested commit message is only the message of
the &#34;fixup -c&#34; commit, and an editor is opened allowing you to edit the
message. The contents (patch) of the &#34;fixup -c&#34; commit are still
incorporated into the folded commit. If there is more than one &#34;fixup
-c&#34; commit, the message from the final one is used. You can also use
&#34;fixup -C&#34; to get the same behavior as &#34;fixup -c&#34; except without opening
an editor.</p>
<p>
<strong>git rebase</strong> will stop when &#34;pick&#34; has been replaced with &#34;edit&#34; or when
a command fails due to merge errors. When you are done editing and/or
resolving conflicts you can continue with <strong>git rebase –continue</strong>.</p>
<p>
For example, if you want to reorder the last 5 commits, such that what
was <strong>HEAD~4</strong> becomes the new <strong>HEAD</strong>. To achieve that, you would call
<strong>git rebase</strong> like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git rebase -i HEAD~5
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
And move the first patch to the end of the list.</p>
<p>
You might want to recreate merge commits, e.g. if you have a history
like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
           X
            \
         A---M---B
        /
---o---O---P---Q
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Suppose you want to rebase the side branch starting at &#34;A&#34; to &#34;Q&#34;. Make
sure that the current <strong>HEAD</strong> is &#34;B&#34;, and call</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git rebase -i -r --onto Q O
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Reordering and editing commits usually creates untested intermediate
steps. You may want to check that your history editing did not break
anything by running a test, or at least recompiling at intermediate
points in history by using the &#34;exec&#34; command (shortcut &#34;x&#34;). You may do
so by creating a todo list like this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
pick deadbee Implement feature XXX
fixup f1a5c00 Fix to feature XXX
exec make
pick c0ffeee The oneline of the next commit
edit deadbab The oneline of the commit after
exec cd subdir; make test
...
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The interactive rebase will stop when a command fails (i.e. exits with
non-0 status) to give you an opportunity to fix the problem. You can
continue with <strong>git rebase –continue</strong>.</p>
<p>
The &#34;exec&#34; command launches the command in a shell (the default one,
usually /bin/sh), so you can use shell features (like &#34;cd&#34;, &#34;&gt;&#34;, &#34;;&#34;
…). The command is run from the root of the working tree.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git rebase -i --exec &#34;make test&#34;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This command lets you check that intermediate commits are compilable.
The todo list becomes like that:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
pick 5928aea one
exec make test
pick 04d0fda two
exec make test
pick ba46169 three
exec make test
pick f4593f9 four
exec make test

SPLITTING COMMITS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-19" class="outline-text-2">
<p>In interactive mode, you can mark commits with the action &#34;edit&#34;.
However, this does not necessarily mean that <strong>git rebase</strong> expects the
result of this edit to be exactly one commit. Indeed, you can undo the
commit, or you can add other commits. This can be used to split a commit
into two:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Start an interactive rebase with <strong>git rebase -i &lt;commit&gt;^</strong>, where
<strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong> is the commit you want to split. In fact, any commit range
will do, as long as it contains that commit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Mark the commit you want to split with the action &#34;edit&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
When it comes to editing that commit, execute <strong>git reset HEAD^</strong>. The
effect is that the <strong>HEAD</strong> is rewound by one, and the index follows suit.
However, the working tree stays the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Now add the changes to the index that you want to have in the first
commit. You can use <strong>git add</strong> (possibly interactively) or <strong>git gui</strong> (or
both) to do that.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Commit the now-current index with whatever commit message is appropriate
now.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Repeat the last two steps until your working tree is clean.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Continue the rebase with <strong>git rebase –continue</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you are not absolutely sure that the intermediate revisions are
consistent (they compile, pass the testsuite, etc.) you should use <strong>git
stash</strong> to stash away the not-yet-committed changes after each commit,
test, and amend the commit if fixes are necessary.</p>

RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-20" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Rebasing (or any other form of rewriting) a branch that others have
based work on is a bad idea: anyone downstream of it is forced to
manually fix their history. This section explains how to do the fix from
the downstream&#39;s point of view. The real fix, however, would be to avoid
rebasing the upstream in the first place.</p>
<p>
To illustrate, suppose you are in a situation where someone develops a
<em>subsystem</em> branch, and you are working on a <em>topic</em> that is dependent
on this <em>subsystem</em>. You might end up with a history like the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
    o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o  master
         \
          o---o---o---o---o  subsystem
                           \
                            *---*---*  topic
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If <em>subsystem</em> is rebased against <em>master</em>, the following happens:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
    o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o  master
         \                       \
          o---o---o---o---o       o--o--o--o--o  subsystem
                           \
                            *---*---*  topic
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you now continue development as usual, and eventually merge <em>topic</em>
to <em>subsystem</em>, the commits from <em>subsystem</em> will remain duplicated
forever:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
    o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o  master
         \                       \
          o---o---o---o---o       o--o--o--o--o--M  subsystem
                           \                         /
                            *---*---*-..........-*--*  topic
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Such duplicates are generally frowned upon because they clutter up
history, making it harder to follow. To clean things up, you need to
transplant the commits on <em>topic</em> to the new <em>subsystem</em> tip, i.e.,
rebase <em>topic</em>. This becomes a ripple effect: anyone downstream from
<em>topic</em> is forced to rebase too, and so on!</p>
<p>
There are two kinds of fixes, discussed in the following subsections:</p>
<p>
Easy case: The changes are literally the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This happens if the <em>subsystem</em> rebase was a simple rebase and had no
conflicts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hard case: The changes are not the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This happens if the <em>subsystem</em> rebase had conflicts, or used
<strong>–interactive</strong> to omit, edit, squash, or fixup commits; or if the
upstream used one of <strong>commit –amend</strong>, <strong>reset</strong>, or a full history
rewriting command like <strong>filter-repo</strong>[2].</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="outline-container-headline-21" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-21">
The easy case
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-21" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Only works if the changes (patch IDs based on the diff contents) on
<em>subsystem</em> are literally the same before and after the rebase
<em>subsystem</em> did.</p>
<p>
In that case, the fix is easy because <em>git rebase</em> knows to skip changes
that are already present in the new upstream (unless
<strong>–reapply-cherry-picks</strong> is given). So if you say (assuming you&#39;re on
<em>topic</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
    $ git rebase subsystem
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
you will end up with the fixed history</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
    o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o  master
                                 \

                                                   \
                                                    *---*---*  topic

<h3 id="headline-22">
The hard case
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-22" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Things get more complicated if the <em>subsystem</em> changes do not exactly
correspond to the ones before the rebase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\\</p>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>
\\</p>
<p>
While an &#34;easy case recovery&#34; sometimes appears to be successful even in
the hard case, it may have unintended consequences. For example, a
commit that was removed via <strong>git rebase –interactive</strong> will be
<strong>resurrected</strong>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The idea is to manually tell <strong>git rebase</strong> &#34;where the old <em>subsystem</em>
ended and your <em>topic</em> began&#34;, that is, what the old merge base between
them was. You will have to find a way to name the last commit of the old
<em>subsystem</em>, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
With the <em>subsystem</em> reflog: after <strong>git fetch</strong>, the old tip of
<em>subsystem</em> is at <strong>subsystem@{1}</strong>. Subsequent fetches will increase the
number. (See *git-reflog*(1).)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Relative to the tip of <em>topic</em>: knowing that your <em>topic</em> has three
commits, the old tip of <em>subsystem</em> must be <strong>topic~3</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You can then transplant the old <strong>subsystem..topic</strong> to the new tip by
saying (for the reflog case, and assuming you are on <em>topic</em> already):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
    $ git rebase --onto subsystem subsystem@{1}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The ripple effect of a &#34;hard case&#34; recovery is especially bad:
<em>everyone</em> downstream from <em>topic</em> will now have to perform a &#34;hard
case&#34; recovery too!</p>

REBASING MERGES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-23" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The interactive rebase command was originally designed to handle
individual patch series. As such, it makes sense to exclude merge
commits from the todo list, as the developer may have merged the
then-current <strong>master</strong> while working on the branch, only to rebase all
the commits onto <strong>master</strong> eventually (skipping the merge commits).</p>
<p>
However, there are legitimate reasons why a developer may want to
recreate merge commits: to keep the branch structure (or &#34;commit
topology&#34;) when working on multiple, inter-related branches.</p>
<p>
In the following example, the developer works on a topic branch that
refactors the way buttons are defined, and on another topic branch that
uses that refactoring to implement a &#34;Report a bug&#34; button. The output
of <strong>git log –graph –format=%s -5</strong> may look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
*   Merge branch report-a-bug
|\
| * Add the feedback button
* | Merge branch refactor-button
|\ \
| |/
| * Use the Button class for all buttons
| * Extract a generic Button class from the DownloadButton one
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The developer might want to rebase those commits to a newer <strong>master</strong>
while keeping the branch topology, for example when the first topic
branch is expected to be integrated into <strong>master</strong> much earlier than the
second one, say, to resolve merge conflicts with changes to the
DownloadButton class that made it into <strong>master</strong>.</p>
<p>
This rebase can be performed using the <strong>–rebase-merges</strong> option. It will
generate a todo list looking like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
label onto

# Branch: refactor-button
reset onto
pick 123456 Extract a generic Button class from the DownloadButton one
pick 654321 Use the Button class for all buttons
label refactor-button

# Branch: report-a-bug
reset refactor-button # Use the Button class for all buttons
pick abcdef Add the feedback button
label report-a-bug

reset onto
merge -C a1b2c3 refactor-button # Merge refactor-button
merge -C 6f5e4d report-a-bug # Merge report-a-bug
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In contrast to a regular interactive rebase, there are <strong>label</strong>, <strong>reset</strong>
and <strong>merge</strong> commands in addition to <strong>pick</strong> ones.</p>
<p>
The <strong>label</strong> command associates a label with the current HEAD when that
command is executed. These labels are created as worktree-local refs
(<strong>refs/rewritten/&lt;label&gt;</strong>) that will be deleted when the rebase
finishes. That way, rebase operations in multiple worktrees linked to
the same repository do not interfere with one another. If the <strong>label</strong>
command fails, it is rescheduled immediately, with a helpful message how
to proceed.</p>
<p>
The <strong>reset</strong> command resets the HEAD, index and worktree to the specified
revision. It is similar to an <strong>exec git reset –hard &lt;label&gt;</strong>, but
refuses to overwrite untracked files. If the <strong>reset</strong> command fails, it
is rescheduled immediately, with a helpful message how to edit the todo
list (this typically happens when a <strong>reset</strong> command was inserted into
the todo list manually and contains a typo).</p>
<p>
The <strong>merge</strong> command will merge the specified revision(s) into whatever
is HEAD at that time. With <strong>-C &lt;original-commit&gt;</strong>, the commit message of
the specified merge commit will be used. When the <strong>-C</strong> is changed to a
lower-case <strong>-c</strong>, the message will be opened in an editor after a
successful merge so that the user can edit the message.</p>
<p>
If a <strong>merge</strong> command fails for any reason other than merge conflicts
(i.e. when the merge operation did not even start), it is rescheduled
immediately.</p>
<p>
By default, the <strong>merge</strong> command will use the <strong>ort</strong> merge strategy for
regular merges, and <strong>octopus</strong> for octopus merges. One can specify a
default strategy for all merges using the <strong>–strategy</strong> argument when
invoking rebase, or can override specific merges in the interactive list
of commands by using an <strong>exec</strong> command to call <strong>git merge</strong> explicitly
with a <strong>–strategy</strong> argument. Note that when calling <strong>git merge</strong>
explicitly like this, you can make use of the fact that the labels are
worktree-local refs (the ref <strong>refs/rewritten/onto</strong> would correspond to
the label <strong>onto</strong>, for example) in order to refer to the branches you
want to merge.</p>
<p>
Note: the first command (<strong>label onto</strong>) labels the revision onto which
the commits are rebased; The name <strong>onto</strong> is just a convention, as a nod
to the <strong>–onto</strong> option.</p>
<p>
It is also possible to introduce completely new merge commits from
scratch by adding a command of the form <strong>merge &lt;merge-head&gt;</strong>. This form
will generate a tentative commit message and always open an editor to
let the user edit it. This can be useful e.g. when a topic branch turns
out to address more than a single concern and wants to be split into two
or even more topic branches. Consider this todo list:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
pick 192837 Switch from GNU Makefiles to CMake
pick 5a6c7e Document the switch to CMake
pick 918273 Fix detection of OpenSSL in CMake
pick afbecd http: add support for TLS v1.3
pick fdbaec Fix detection of cURL in CMake on Windows
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The one commit in this list that is not related to CMake may very well
have been motivated by working on fixing all those bugs introduced by
switching to CMake, but it addresses a different concern. To split this
branch into two topic branches, the todo list could be edited like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
label onto

pick afbecd http: add support for TLS v1.3
label tlsv1.3

reset onto
pick 192837 Switch from GNU Makefiles to CMake
pick 918273 Fix detection of OpenSSL in CMake
pick fdbaec Fix detection of cURL in CMake on Windows
pick 5a6c7e Document the switch to CMake
label cmake

reset onto
merge tlsv1.3
merge cmake
