DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>This manual page documents the GNU version of <strong>xargs</strong>. <strong>xargs</strong> reads
items from the standard input, delimited by blanks (which can be
protected with double or single quotes or a backslash) or newlines, and
executes the <em>command</em> (default is <em>echo</em>) one or more times with any
<em>initial-arguments</em> followed by items read from standard input. Blank
lines on the standard input are ignored.</p>
<p>
The command line for <em>command</em> is built up until it reaches a
system-defined limit (unless the <strong>-n</strong> and <strong>-L</strong> options are used). The
specified <em>command</em> will be invoked as many times as necessary to use up
the list of input items. In general, there will be many fewer
invocations of <em>command</em> than there were items in the input. This will
normally have significant performance benefits. Some commands can
usefully be executed in parallel too; see the <strong>-P</strong> option.</p>
<p>
Because Unix filenames can contain blanks and newlines, this default
behaviour is often problematic; filenames containing blanks and/or
newlines are incorrectly processed by <strong>xargs</strong>. In these situations it is
better to use the <strong>-0</strong> option, which prevents such problems. When using
this option you will need to ensure that the program which produces the
input for <strong>xargs</strong> also uses a null character as a separator. If that
program is GNU <strong>find</strong> for example, the <strong>-print0</strong> option does this for
you.</p>
<p>
If any invocation of the command exits with a status of 255, <strong>xargs</strong>
will stop immediately without reading any further input. An error
message is issued on stderr when this happens.</p>

<h2 id="headline-4">
OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-0, –null</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Input items are terminated by a null character instead
of by whitespace, and the quotes and backslash are not special (every
character is taken literally). Disables the end-of-file string, which
is treated like any other argument. Useful when input items might
contain white space, quote marks, or backslashes. The GNU find -print0
option produces input suitable for this mode.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-a */file/</strong>, –arg-file=*/file/
</dt>
<dd>Read items from <em>file</em> instead of
standard input. If you use this option, stdin remains unchanged when
commands are run. Otherwise, stdin is redirected from <em>/dev/null</em>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–delimiter=*/delim/</strong>, -d*/ delim/
</dt>
<dd>Input items are terminated by
the specified character. The specified delimiter may be a single
character, a C-style character escape such as <strong>\n</strong>, or an octal or
hexadecimal escape code. Octal and hexadecimal escape codes are
understood as for the <strong>printf</strong> command. Multibyte characters are not
supported. When processing the input, quotes and backslash are not
special; every character in the input is taken literally. The <strong>-d</strong>
option disables any end-of-file string, which is treated like any
other argument. You can use this option when the input consists of
simply newline-separated items, although it is almost always better to
design your program to use <strong>–null</strong> where this is possible.</dd>
<dt>
*-E*/ eof-str/
</dt>
<dd>Set the end-of-file string to <em>eof-str</em>. If the
end-of-file string occurs as a line of input, the rest of the input is
ignored. If neither <strong>-E</strong> nor <strong>-e</strong> is used, no end-of-file string is
used.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-e</strong>[/eof-str/], <strong>–eof</strong>[/=eof-str/]
</dt>
<dd>This option is a synonym for
the <strong>-E</strong> option. Use <strong>-E</strong> instead, because it is POSIX compliant while
this option is not. If <em>eof-str</em> is omitted, there is no end-of-file
string. If neither <strong>-E</strong> nor <strong>-e</strong> is used, no end-of-file string is
used.</dd>
<dt>
*-I*/ replace-str/
</dt>
<dd>Replace occurrences of <em>replace-str</em> in the
initial-arguments with names read from standard input. Also, unquoted
blanks do not terminate input items; instead the separator is the
newline character. Implies <strong>-x</strong> and <strong>-L</strong> 1.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-i</strong>[/replace-str/], <strong>–replace</strong>[/=replace-str/]
</dt>
<dd>This option is a
synonym for *-I*/replace-str/ if <em>replace-str</em> is specified. If the
<em>replace-str</em> argument is missing, the effect is the same as <strong>-I*{}.
The *-i</strong> option is deprecated; use <strong>-I</strong> instead.</dd>
<dt>
*-L*/ max-lines/
</dt>
<dd>Use at most <em>max-lines</em> nonblank input lines per
command line. Trailing blanks cause an input line to be logically
continued on the next input line. Implies <strong>-x</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-l</strong>[/max-lines/], <strong>–max-lines</strong>[=/max-lines/]
</dt>
<dd>Synonym for the <strong>-L</strong>
option. Unlike <strong>-L</strong>, the <em>max-lines</em> argument is optional. If
<em>max-lines</em> is not specified, it defaults to one. The <strong>-l</strong> option is
deprecated since the POSIX standard specifies <strong>-L</strong> instead.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-n*/ max-args, /</strong>–max-args*/=/max-args//
</dt>
<dd>Use at most <em>max-args</em>
arguments per command line. Fewer than <em>max-args</em> arguments will be
used if the size (see the <strong>-s</strong> option) is exceeded, unless the <strong>-x</strong>
option is given, in which case <strong>xargs</strong> will exit.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-P*/ max-procs, /</strong>–max-procs*/=/max-procs//
</dt>
<dd>Run up to <em>max-procs</em>
processes at a time; the default is 1. If <em>max-procs</em> is 0, <strong>xargs</strong>
will run as many processes as possible at a time. Use the <strong>-n</strong> option
or the <strong>-L</strong> option with <strong>-P</strong>; otherwise chances are that only one exec
will be done. While <strong>xargs</strong> is running, you can send its process a
SIGUSR1 signal to increase the number of commands to run
simultaneously, or a SIGUSR2 to decrease the number. You cannot
increase it above an implementation-defined limit (which is shown with
–show-limits). You cannot decrease it below 1. <strong>xargs</strong> never
terminates its commands; when asked to decrease, it merely waits for
more than one existing command to terminate before starting another.
<strong>xargs</strong> always waits for all child processes to exit before exiting
itself (but see BUGS).

If you do not use the <strong>-P</strong> option, <strong>xargs</strong> will not handle the SIGUSR1
and SIGUSR2 signals, meaning that they will terminate the program
(unless they were blocked in the parent process before <strong>xargs</strong> was
started).

<strong>Please note</strong> that it is up to the called processes to properly manage
parallel access to shared resources. For example, if more than one of
them tries to print to stdout, the output will be produced in an
indeterminate order (and very likely mixed up) unless the processes
collaborate in some way to prevent this. Using some kind of locking
scheme is one way to prevent such problems. In general, using a
locking scheme will help ensure correct output but reduce performance.
If you don&#39;t want to tolerate the performance difference, simply
arrange for each process to produce a separate output file (or
otherwise use separate resources).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-o, –open-tty</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Reopen stdin as <em>/dev/tty</em> in the child process
before executing the command. This is useful if you want <strong>xargs</strong> to
run an interactive application.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-p, –interactive</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Prompt the user about whether to run each
command line and read a line from the terminal. Only run the command
line if the response starts with `y&#39; or `Y&#39;. Implies <strong>-t</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
*–process-slot-var*=/name/
</dt>
<dd>Set the environment variable <em>name</em> to
a unique value in each running child process. Values are reused once
child processes exit. This can be used in a rudimentary load
distribution scheme, for example.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-r, –no-run-if-empty</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If the standard input does not contain any
nonblanks, do not run the command. Normally, the command is run once
even if there is no input. This option is a GNU extension.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-s*/ max-chars, /</strong>–max-chars*/=/max-chars//
</dt>
<dd>Use at most
<em>max-chars</em> characters per command line, including the command and
initial-arguments and the terminating nulls at the ends of the
argument strings. The largest allowed value is system-dependent, and
is calculated as the argument length limit for exec, less the size of
your environment, less 2048 bytes of headroom. If this value is more
than 128 KiB, 128 KiB is used as the default value; otherwise, the
default value is the maximum. 1 KiB is 1024 bytes. <strong>xargs</strong>
automatically adapts to tighter constraints.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–show-limits</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Display the limits on the command-line length which
are imposed by the operating system, <strong>xargs</strong>&#39; choice of buffer size
and the <strong>-s</strong> option. Pipe the input from <em>/dev/null</em> (and perhaps
specify <strong>–no-run-if-empty</strong>) if you don&#39;t want <strong>xargs</strong> to do anything.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-t, –verbose</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print the command line on the standard error output
before executing it.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-x, –exit</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Exit if the size (see the <strong>-s</strong> option) is exceeded.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Delimit the option list. Later arguments, if any, are treated
as operands even if they begin with <em>-</em>. For example, <strong>xargs –
–help</strong> runs the command <em>–help</em> (found in <em>PATH</em>) instead of
printing the usage text, and <strong>xargs – –mycommand</strong> runs the command
<em>–mycommand</em> instead of rejecting this as unrecognized option.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–help</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print a summary of the options to <strong>xargs</strong> and exit.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–version</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print the version number of <strong>xargs</strong> and exit.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The options <strong>–max-lines</strong> (<strong>-L</strong>, <strong>-l</strong>), <strong>–replace</strong> (<strong>-I</strong>, <strong>-i</strong>) and
<strong>–max-args</strong> (<strong>-n</strong>) are mutually exclusive. If some of them are
specified at the same time, then <strong>xargs</strong> will generally use the option
specified last on the command line, i.e., it will reset the value of the
offending option (given before) to its default value. Additionally,
<strong>xargs</strong> will issue a warning diagnostic on <em>stderr</em>. The exception to
this rule is that the special <em>max-args</em> value <em>1</em> (&#39;<strong>-n*/1/&#39;) is
ignored after the *–replace</strong> option and its aliases <strong>-I</strong> and <strong>-i</strong>,
because it would not actually conflict.</p>

EXAMPLES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<pre class="example">
find /tmp -name core -type f -print | xargs /bin/rm -f
</pre>
<p>
Find files named <strong>core</strong> in or below the directory <strong>/tmp</strong> and delete
them. Note that this will work incorrectly if there are any filenames
containing newlines or spaces.</p>
<p>
<strong>find /tmp -name core -type f -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -f</strong></p>
<p>
Find files named <strong>core</strong> in or below the directory <strong>/tmp</strong> and delete
them, processing filenames in such a way that file or directory names
containing spaces or newlines are correctly handled.</p>
<p>
<strong>find /tmp -depth -name core -type f -delete</strong></p>
<p>
Find files named <strong>core</strong> in or below the directory <strong>/tmp</strong> and delete
them, but more efficiently than in the previous example (because we
avoid the need to use <strong>fork*(2) and *exec*(2) to launch *rm</strong> and we
don&#39;t need the extra <strong>xargs</strong> process).</p>
<pre class="example">
cut -d: -f1 &lt; /etc/passwd | sort | xargs echo
</pre>
<p>
Generates a compact listing of all the users on the system.</p>

EXIT STATUS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>xargs</strong> exits with the following status:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li value="0">if it succeeds</li>
<li>if any invocation of the command exited with status 1–125</li>
<li>if the command exited with status 255</li>
<li>if the command is killed by a signal</li>
<li>if the command cannot be run</li>
<li>if the command is not found</li>
<li>if some other error occurred.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
Exit codes greater than 128 are used by the shell to indicate that a
program died due to a fatal signal.</p>

STANDARDS CONFORMANCE
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>As of GNU xargs version 4.2.9, the default behaviour of <strong>xargs</strong> is not
to have a logical end-of-file marker. POSIX (IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004
Edition) allows this.</p>
<p>
The -l and -i options appear in the 1997 version of the POSIX standard,
but do not appear in the 2004 version of the standard. Therefore you
should use -L and -I instead, respectively.</p>
<p>
The -o option is an extension to the POSIX standard for better
compatibility with BSD.</p>
<p>
The POSIX standard allows implementations to have a limit on the size of
arguments to the <strong>exec</strong> functions. This limit could be as low as 4096
bytes including the size of the environment. For scripts to be portable,
they must not rely on a larger value. However, I know of no
implementation whose actual limit is that small. The <strong>–show-limits</strong>
option can be used to discover the actual limits in force on the current
system.</p>
<p>
In versions of <strong>xargs</strong> up to and including version 4.9.0, SIGUSR1 and
SIGUSR2 would not cause <strong>xargs</strong> to terminate even if the <strong>-P</strong> option was
not used.</p>

<h2 id="headline-8">
HISTORY
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The <strong>xargs</strong> program was invented by Herb Gellis at Bell Labs. See the
Texinfo manual for findutils, <em>Finding Files</em>, for more information.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-9">
BUGS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p>It is not possible for <strong>xargs</strong> to be used securely, since there will
always be a time gap between the production of the list of input files
and their use in the commands that <strong>xargs</strong> issues. If other users have
access to the system, they can manipulate the filesystem during this
time window to force the action of the commands <strong>xargs</strong> runs to apply to
files that you didn&#39;t intend. For a more detailed discussion of this and
related problems, please refer to the ``Security Considerations&#39;&#39;
chapter in the findutils Texinfo documentation. The <strong>-execdir</strong> option of
<strong>find</strong> can often be used as a more secure alternative.</p>
<p>
When you use the <strong>-I</strong> option, each line read from the input is buffered
internally. This means that there is an upper limit on the length of
input line that <strong>xargs</strong> will accept when used with the <strong>-I</strong> option. To
work around this limitation, you can use the <strong>-s</strong> option to increase the
amount of buffer space that <strong>xargs</strong> uses, and you can also use an extra
invocation of <strong>xargs</strong> to ensure that very long lines do not occur. For
example:</p>
<p>
<strong>somecommand | xargs -s 50000 echo | xargs -I &#39;{}&#39; -s 100000 rm &#39;{}&#39;</strong></p>
<p>
Here, the first invocation of <strong>xargs</strong> has no input line length limit
because it doesn&#39;t use the <strong>-i</strong> option. The second invocation of <strong>xargs</strong>
does have such a limit, but we have ensured that it never encounters a
line which is longer than it can handle. This is not an ideal solution.
Instead, the <strong>-i</strong> option should not impose a line length limit, which is
why this discussion appears in the BUGS section. The problem doesn&#39;t
occur with the output of *find*(1) because it emits just one filename
per line.</p>
<p>
In versions of <strong>xargs</strong> up to and including version 4.9.0, <strong>xargs -P</strong>
would exit while some of its children were still running, if one of them
exited with status 255.</p>
