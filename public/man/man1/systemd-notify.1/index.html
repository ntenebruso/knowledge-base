DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>systemd-notify</strong> may be called by service scripts to notify the invoking
service manager about status changes. It can be used to send arbitrary
information, encoded in an environment-block-like list of strings. Most
importantly, it can be used for start-up completion notification.</p>
<p>
This is mostly just a wrapper around <strong>sd_notify()</strong> and makes this
functionality available to shell scripts. For details see
*sd_notify*(3).</p>
<p>
The command line may carry a list of environment variables to send as
part of the status update.</p>
<p>
Note that systemd will refuse reception of status updates from this
command unless <em>NotifyAccess=</em> is appropriately set for the service unit
this command is called from. See *systemd.service*(5) for details.</p>
<p>
Note that <strong>sd_notify()</strong> notifications may be attributed to units
correctly only if either the sending process is still around at the time
the service manager processes the message, or if the sending process is
explicitly runtime-tracked by the service manager. The latter is the
case if the service manager originally forked off the process, i.e. on
all processes that match /NotifyAccess=/*main* or /NotifyAccess=/*exec*.
Conversely, if an auxiliary process of the unit sends an <strong>sd_notify()</strong>
message and immediately exits, the service manager might not be able to
properly attribute the message to the unit, and thus will ignore it,
even if /NotifyAccess=/*all* is set for it. To address this
<strong>systemd-notify</strong> will wait until the notification message has been
processed by the service manager. When <strong>–no-block</strong> is used, this
synchronization for reception of notifications is disabled, and hence
the aforementioned race may occur if the invoking process is not the
service manager or spawned by the service manager.</p>
<p>
<strong>systemd-notify</strong> will first attempt to invoke <strong>sd_notify()</strong> pretending
to have the PID of the parent process of <strong>systemd-notify</strong> (i.e. the
invoking process). This will only succeed when invoked with sufficient
privileges. On failure, it will then fall back to invoking it under its
own PID. This behaviour is useful in order that when the tool is invoked
from a shell script the shell process — and not the <strong>systemd-notify</strong>
process — appears as sender of the message, which in turn is helpful
if the shell process is the main process of a service, due to the
limitations of /NotifyAccess=/*all*. Use the <strong>–pid=</strong> switch to tweak
this behaviour.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The following options are understood:</p>
<p>
<strong>–ready</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inform the invoking service manager about service start-up or
configuration reload completion. This is equivalent to <strong>systemd-notify
READY=1</strong>. For details about the semantics of this option see
*sd_notify*(3).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–reloading</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inform the invoking service manager about the beginning of a
configuration reload cycle. This is equivalent to <strong>systemd-notify
RELOADING=1</strong> (but implicitly also sets a <em>MONOTONIC_USEC=</em> field as
required for <em>Type=notify-reload</em> services, see *systemd.service*(5) for
details). For details about the semantics of this option see
*sd_notify*(3).</p>
<p>
Added in version 253.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–stopping</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inform the invoking service manager about the beginning of the shutdown
phase of the service. This is equivalent to <strong>systemd-notify STOPPING=1</strong>.
For details about the semantics of this option see *sd_notify*(3).</p>
<p>
Added in version 253.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–pid=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inform the service manager about the main PID of the service. Takes a
PID as argument. If the argument is specified as &#34;auto&#34; or omitted, the
PID of the process that invoked <strong>systemd-notify</strong> is used, except if
thats the service manager. If the argument is specified as &#34;self&#34;, the
PID of the <strong>systemd-notify</strong> command itself is used, and if &#34;parent&#34; is
specified the calling process PID is used — even if it is the service
manager. <strong>–pid=auto</strong> is equivalent to <strong>systemd-notify MAINPID=$PID</strong>.
For details about the semantics of this option see *sd_notify*(3).</p>
<p>
If this switch is used in an <strong>systemd-notify</strong> invocation from a process
that shall become the new main process of a service — and which is not
the process forked off by the service manager (or the current main
process) —, then it is essential to set <em>NotifyAccess=all</em> in the
service unit file, or otherwise the notification will be ignored for
security reasons. See *systemd.service*(5) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–uid=*/USER/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the user ID to send the notification from. Takes a UNIX user name or
numeric UID. When specified the notification message will be sent with
the specified UID as sender, in place of the user the command was
invoked as. This option requires sufficient privileges in order to be
able manipulate the user identity of the process.</p>
<p>
Added in version 237.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–status=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Send a free-form human readable status string for the daemon to the
service manager. This option takes the status string as argument. This
is equivalent to <strong>systemd-notify STATUS=…</strong>. For details about the
semantics of this option see <strong>sd_notify*(3). This information is shown
in *systemctl*(1)s *status</strong> output, among other places.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–booted</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns 0 if the system was booted up with systemd, non-zero otherwise.
If this option is passed, no message is sent. This option is hence
unrelated to the other options. For details about the semantics of this
option, see <strong>sd_booted*(3). An alternate way to check for this state is
to call *systemctl*(1) with the *is-system-running</strong> command. It will
return &#34;offline&#34; if the system was not booted with systemd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–no-block</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not synchronously wait for the requested operation to finish. Use of
this option is only recommended when <strong>systemd-notify</strong> is spawned by the
service manager, or when the invoking process is directly spawned by the
service manager and has enough privileges to allow <strong>systemd-notify</strong> to
send the notification on its behalf. Sending notifications with this
option set is prone to race conditions in all other cases.</p>
<p>
Added in version 246.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–exec</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If specified <strong>systemd-notify</strong> will execute another command line after it
completed its operation, replacing its own process. If used, the list of
assignments to include in the message sent must be followed by a &#34;;&#34;
character (as separate argument), followed by the command line to
execute. This permits &#34;chaining&#34; of commands, i.e. issuing one
operation, followed immediately by another, without changing PIDs.</p>
<p>
Note that many shells interpret &#34;;&#34; as their own separator for command
lines, hence when <strong>systemd-notify</strong> is invoked from a shell the semicolon
must usually be escaped as &#34;\;&#34;.</p>
<p>
Added in version 254.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–fd=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Send a file descriptor along with the notification message. This is
useful when invoked in services that have the <em>FileDescriptorStoreMax=</em>
setting enabled, see <strong>systemd.service*(5) for details. The specified
file descriptor must be passed to *systemd-notify</strong> when invoked. This
option may be used multiple times to pass multiple file descriptors in a
single notification message.</p>
<p>
To use this functionality from a *bash*(1) shell, use an expression like
the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
systemd-notify --fd=4 --fd=5 4&lt;/some/file 5&lt;/some/other/file
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Added in version 254.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–fdname=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set a name to assign to the file descriptors passed via <strong>–fd=</strong> (see
above). This controls the &#34;FDNAME=&#34; field. This setting may only be
specified once, and applies to all file descriptors passed. Invoke this
tool multiple times in case multiple file descriptors with different
file descriptor names shall be submitted.</p>
<p>
Added in version 254.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-h</strong>, <strong>–help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short version string and exit.</p>
</blockquote>

EXAMPLE
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>Example 1. Start-up Notification and Status Updates</strong></p>
<p>
A simple shell daemon that sends start-up notifications after having set
up its communication channel. During runtime it sends further status
updates to the init system:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
#!/bin/sh

mkfifo /tmp/waldo
systemd-notify --ready --status=&#34;Waiting for data...&#34;

while : ; do
        read -r a &lt; /tmp/waldo
        systemd-notify --status=&#34;Processing $a&#34;

        # Do something with $a ...

        systemd-notify --status=&#34;Waiting for data...&#34;
done
