DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Invoked by <em>git send-pack</em> and updates the repository with the
information fed from the remote end.</p>
<p>
This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user. The UI for
the protocol is on the <em>git send-pack</em> side, and the program pair is
meant to be used to push updates to a remote repository. For pull
operations, see *git-fetch-pack*(1).</p>
<p>
The command allows for the creation and fast-forwarding of sha1 refs
(heads/tags) on the remote end (strictly speaking, it is the local end
<em>git-receive-pack</em> runs, but to the user who is sitting at the send-pack
end, it is updating the remote. Confused?)</p>
<p>
There are other real-world examples of using update and post-update
hooks found in the Documentation/howto directory.</p>
<p>
<em>git-receive-pack</em> honours the receive.denyNonFastForwards config
option, which tells it if updates to a ref should be denied if they are
not fast-forwards.</p>
<p>
A number of other receive.* config options are available to tweak its
behavior, see *git-config*(1).</p>

PRE-RECEIVE HOOK
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Before any ref is updated, if $GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-receive file exists and
is executable, it will be invoked once with no parameters. The standard
input of the hook will be one line per ref to be updated:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
sha1-old SP sha1-new SP refname LF
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The refname value is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master head this
is &#34;refs/heads/master&#34;. The two sha1 values before each refname are the
object names for the refname before and after the update. Refs to be
created will have sha1-old equal to 0{40}, while refs to be deleted will
have sha1-new equal to 0{40}, otherwise sha1-old and sha1-new should be
valid objects in the repository.</p>
<p>
When accepting a signed push (see *git-push*(1)), the signed push
certificate is stored in a blob and an environment variable
<strong>GIT_PUSH_CERT</strong> can be consulted for its object name. See the
description of <strong>post-receive</strong> hook for an example. In addition, the
certificate is verified using GPG and the result is exported with the
following environment variables:</p>
<p>
<strong>GIT_PUSH_CERT_SIGNER</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The name and the e-mail address of the owner of the key that signed the
push certificate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>GIT_PUSH_CERT_KEY</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The GPG key ID of the key that signed the push certificate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>GIT_PUSH_CERT_STATUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The status of GPG verification of the push certificate, using the same
mnemonic as used in <strong>%G?</strong> format of <strong>git log</strong> family of commands (see
*git-log*(1)).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The nonce string the process asked the signer to include in the push
certificate. If this does not match the value recorded on the &#34;nonce&#34;
header in the push certificate, it may indicate that the certificate is
a valid one that is being replayed from a separate &#34;git push&#34; session.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_STATUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UNSOLICITED</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;git push –signed&#34; sent a nonce when we did not ask it to send one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>MISSING</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;git push –signed&#34; did not send any nonce header.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>BAD</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;git push –signed&#34; sent a bogus nonce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>OK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;git push –signed&#34; sent the nonce we asked it to send.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>SLOP</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;git push –signed&#34; sent a nonce different from what we asked it to send
now, but in a previous session. See <strong>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_SLOP</strong>
environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_SLOP</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;git push –signed&#34; sent a nonce different from what we asked it to send
now, but in a different session whose starting time is different by this
many seconds from the current session. Only meaningful when
<strong>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_STATUS</strong> says <strong>SLOP</strong>. Also read about
<strong>receive.certNonceSlop</strong> variable in *git-config*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This hook is called before any refname is updated and before any
fast-forward checks are performed.</p>
<p>
If the pre-receive hook exits with a non-zero exit status no updates
will be performed, and the update, post-receive and post-update hooks
will not be invoked either. This can be useful to quickly bail out if
the update is not to be supported.</p>
<p>
See the notes on the quarantine environment below.</p>

UPDATE HOOK
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Before each ref is updated, if $GIT_DIR/hooks/update file exists and is
executable, it is invoked once per ref, with three parameters:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$GIT_DIR/hooks/update refname sha1-old sha1-new
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The refname parameter is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master head
this is &#34;refs/heads/master&#34;. The two sha1 arguments are the object names
for the refname before and after the update. Note that the hook is
called before the refname is updated, so either sha1-old is 0{40}
(meaning there is no such ref yet), or it should match what is recorded
in refname.</p>
<p>
The hook should exit with non-zero status if it wants to disallow
updating the named ref. Otherwise it should exit with zero.</p>
<p>
Successful execution (a zero exit status) of this hook does not ensure
the ref will actually be updated, it is only a prerequisite. As such it
is not a good idea to send notices (e.g. email) from this hook. Consider
using the post-receive hook instead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-7">
POST-RECEIVE HOOK
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>After all refs were updated (or attempted to be updated), if any ref
update was successful, and if $GIT_DIR/hooks/post-receive file exists
and is executable, it will be invoked once with no parameters. The
standard input of the hook will be one line for each successfully
updated ref:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
sha1-old SP sha1-new SP refname LF
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The refname value is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master head this
is &#34;refs/heads/master&#34;. The two sha1 values before each refname are the
object names for the refname before and after the update. Refs that were
created will have sha1-old equal to 0{40}, while refs that were deleted
will have sha1-new equal to 0{40}, otherwise sha1-old and sha1-new
should be valid objects in the repository.</p>
<p>
The <strong>GIT_PUSH_CERT*</strong> environment variables can be inspected, just as in
<strong>pre-receive</strong> hook, after accepting a signed push.</p>
<p>
Using this hook, it is easy to generate mails describing the updates to
the repository. This example script sends one mail message per ref
listing the commits pushed to the repository, and logs the push
certificates of signed pushes with good signatures to a logger service:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
#!/bin/sh
# mail out commit update information.
while read oval nval ref
do
        if expr &#34;$oval&#34; : 0*$ &gt;/dev/null
        then
                echo &#34;Created a new ref, with the following commits:&#34;
                git rev-list --pretty &#34;$nval&#34;
        else
                echo &#34;New commits:&#34;
                git rev-list --pretty &#34;$nval&#34; &#34;^$oval&#34;
        fi |
        mail -s &#34;Changes to ref $ref&#34; commit-list@mydomain
done
# log signed push certificate, if any
if test -n &#34;${GIT_PUSH_CERT-}&#34; &amp;&amp; test ${GIT_PUSH_CERT_STATUS} = G
then
        (
                echo expected nonce is ${GIT_PUSH_NONCE}
                git cat-file blob ${GIT_PUSH_CERT}
        ) | mail -s &#34;push certificate from $GIT_PUSH_CERT_SIGNER&#34; push-log@mydomain
fi
exit 0
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The exit code from this hook invocation is ignored, however a non-zero
exit code will generate an error message.</p>
<p>
Note that it is possible for refname to not have sha1-new when this hook
runs. This can easily occur if another user modifies the ref after it
was updated by <em>git-receive-pack</em>, but before the hook was able to
evaluate it. It is recommended that hooks rely on sha1-new rather than
the current value of refname.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-8">
POST-UPDATE HOOK
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>After all other processing, if at least one ref was updated, and if
$GIT_DIR/hooks/post-update file exists and is executable, then
post-update will be called with the list of refs that have been updated.
This can be used to implement any repository wide cleanup tasks.</p>
<p>
The exit code from this hook invocation is ignored; the only thing left
for <em>git-receive-pack</em> to do at that point is to exit itself anyway.</p>
<p>
This hook can be used, for example, to run <strong>git update-server-info</strong> if
the repository is packed and is served via a dumb transport.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
#!/bin/sh
exec git update-server-info
</pre>
</blockquote>

<div id="outline-container-headline-9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-9">
QUARANTINE ENVIRONMENT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When <strong>receive-pack</strong> takes in objects, they are placed into a temporary
&#34;quarantine&#34; directory within the <strong>$GIT_DIR/objects</strong> directory and
migrated into the main object store only after the <strong>pre-receive</strong> hook
has completed. If the push fails before then, the temporary directory is
removed entirely.</p>
<p>
This has a few user-visible effects and caveats:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Pushes which fail due to problems with the incoming pack, missing
objects, or due to the <strong>pre-receive</strong> hook will not leave any on-disk
data. This is usually helpful to prevent repeated failed pushes from
filling up your disk, but can make debugging more challenging.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Any objects created by the <strong>pre-receive</strong> hook will be created in the
quarantine directory (and migrated only if it succeeds).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>pre-receive</strong> hook MUST NOT update any refs to point to quarantined
objects. Other programs accessing the repository will not be able to see
the objects (and if the pre-receive hook fails, those refs would become
corrupted). For safety, any ref updates from within <strong>pre-receive</strong> are
automatically rejected.</p>
