DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Annotates each line in the given file with information from the revision
which last modified the line. Optionally, start annotating from the
given revision.</p>
<p>
When specified one or more times, <strong>-L</strong> restricts annotation to the
requested lines.</p>
<p>
The origin of lines is automatically followed across whole-file renames
(currently there is no option to turn the rename-following off). To
follow lines moved from one file to another, or to follow lines that
were copied and pasted from another file, etc., see the <strong>-C</strong> and <strong>-M</strong>
options.</p>
<p>
The report does not tell you anything about lines which have been
deleted or replaced; you need to use a tool such as <em>git diff</em> or the
&#34;pickaxe&#34; interface briefly mentioned in the following paragraph.</p>
<p>
Apart from supporting file annotation, Git also supports searching the
development history for when a code snippet occurred in a change. This
makes it possible to track when a code snippet was added to a file,
moved or copied between files, and eventually deleted or replaced. It
works by searching for a text string in the diff. A small example of the
pickaxe interface that searches for <strong>blame_usage</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git log --pretty=oneline -Sblame_usage
5040f17eba15504bad66b14a645bddd9b015ebb7 blame -S &lt;ancestry-file&gt;

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>-b</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show blank SHA-1 for boundary commits. This can also be controlled via
the <strong>blame.blankBoundary</strong> config option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–root</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not treat root commits as boundaries. This can also be controlled via
the <strong>blame.showRoot</strong> config option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–show-stats</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Include additional statistics at the end of blame output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-L &lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;, -L :&lt;funcname&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Annotate only the line range given by <em>&lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;</em>, or by the
function name regex <em>&lt;funcname&gt;</em>. May be specified multiple times.
Overlapping ranges are allowed.</p>
<p>
<em>&lt;start&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;end&gt;</em> are optional. <strong>-L &lt;start&gt;</strong> or <strong>-L &lt;start&gt;,</strong> spans
from <em>&lt;start&gt;</em> to end of file. <strong>-L ,&lt;end&gt;</strong> spans from start of file to
<em>&lt;end&gt;</em>.</p>
<p>
<em>&lt;start&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;end&gt;</em> can take one of these forms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
number</p>
<p>
If <em>&lt;start&gt;</em> or <em>&lt;end&gt;</em> is a number, it specifies an absolute line
number (lines count from 1).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong><em>regex</em></strong></p>
<p>
This form will use the first line matching the given POSIX regex. If
<em>&lt;start&gt;</em> is a regex, it will search from the end of the previous <strong>-L</strong>
range, if any, otherwise from the start of file. If <em>&lt;start&gt;</em> is
<strong>^/regex/</strong>, it will search from the start of file. If <em>&lt;end&gt;</em> is a
regex, it will search starting at the line given by <em>&lt;start&gt;</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
+offset or -offset</p>
<p>
This is only valid for <em>&lt;end&gt;</em> and will specify a number of lines before
or after the line given by <em>&lt;start&gt;</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If <strong>:&lt;funcname&gt;</strong> is given in place of <em>&lt;start&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;end&gt;</em>, it is a
regular expression that denotes the range from the first funcname line
that matches <em>&lt;funcname&gt;</em>, up to the next funcname line. <strong>:&lt;funcname&gt;</strong>
searches from the end of the previous <strong>-L</strong> range, if any, otherwise from
the start of file. <strong>^:&lt;funcname&gt;</strong> searches from the start of file. The
function names are determined in the same way as <strong>git diff</strong> works out
patch hunk headers (see <em>Defining a custom hunk-header</em> in
*gitattributes*(5)).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-l</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show long rev (Default: off).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-t</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show raw timestamp (Default: off).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-S &lt;revs-file&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use revisions from revs-file instead of calling *git-rev-list*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–reverse &lt;rev&gt;..&lt;rev&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walk history forward instead of backward. Instead of showing the
revision in which a line appeared, this shows the last revision in which
a line has existed. This requires a range of revision like START..END
where the path to blame exists in START. <strong>git blame –reverse START</strong> is
taken as <strong>git blame –reverse START..HEAD</strong> for convenience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–first-parent</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit. This
option can be used to determine when a line was introduced to a
particular integration branch, rather than when it was introduced to the
history overall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-p, –porcelain</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show in a format designed for machine consumption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–line-porcelain</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the porcelain format, but output commit information for each line,
not just the first time a commit is referenced. Implies –porcelain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–incremental</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the result incrementally in a format designed for machine
consumption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–encoding=&lt;encoding&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the encoding used to output author names and commit summaries.
Setting it to <strong>none</strong> makes blame output unconverted data. For more
information see the discussion about encoding in the *git-log*(1) manual
page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–contents &lt;file&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Annotate using the contents from the named file, starting from &lt;rev&gt; if
it is specified, and HEAD otherwise. You may specify <em>-</em> to make the
command read from the standard input for the file contents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–date &lt;format&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the format used to output dates. If –date is not provided,
the value of the blame.date config variable is used. If the blame.date
config variable is also not set, the iso format is used. For supported
values, see the discussion of the –date option at *git-log*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]progress</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default when
it is attached to a terminal. This flag enables progress reporting even
if not attached to a terminal. Can&#39;t use <strong>–progress</strong> together with
<strong>–porcelain</strong> or <strong>–incremental</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-M[&lt;num&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Detect moved or copied lines within a file. When a commit moves or
copies a block of lines (e.g. the original file has A and then B, and
the commit changes it to B and then A), the traditional <em>blame</em>
algorithm notices only half of the movement and typically blames the
lines that were moved up (i.e. B) to the parent and assigns blame to the
lines that were moved down (i.e. A) to the child commit. With this
option, both groups of lines are blamed on the parent by running extra
passes of inspection.</p>
<p>
&lt;num&gt; is optional but it is the lower bound on the number of
alphanumeric characters that Git must detect as moving/copying within a
file for it to associate those lines with the parent commit. The default
value is 20.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-C[&lt;num&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to <strong>-M</strong>, detect lines moved or copied from other files that
were modified in the same commit. This is useful when you reorganize
your program and move code around across files. When this option is
given twice, the command additionally looks for copies from other files
in the commit that creates the file. When this option is given three
times, the command additionally looks for copies from other files in any
commit.</p>
<p>
&lt;num&gt; is optional but it is the lower bound on the number of
alphanumeric characters that Git must detect as moving/copying between
files for it to associate those lines with the parent commit. And the
default value is 40. If there are more than one <strong>-C</strong> options given, the
&lt;num&gt; argument of the last <strong>-C</strong> will take effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignore-rev &lt;rev&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore changes made by the revision when assigning blame, as if the
change never happened. Lines that were changed or added by an ignored
commit will be blamed on the previous commit that changed that line or
nearby lines. This option may be specified multiple times to ignore more
than one revision. If the <strong>blame.markIgnoredLines</strong> config option is set,
then lines that were changed by an ignored commit and attributed to
another commit will be marked with a <strong>?</strong> in the blame output. If the
<strong>blame.markUnblamableLines</strong> config option is set, then those lines
touched by an ignored commit that we could not attribute to another
revision are marked with a <em>*</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignore-revs-file &lt;file&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore revisions listed in <strong>file</strong>, which must be in the same format as
an <strong>fsck.skipList</strong>. This option may be repeated, and these files will be
processed after any files specified with the <strong>blame.ignoreRevsFile</strong>
config option. An empty file name, <strong>&#34;&#34;</strong>, will clear the list of revs
from previously processed files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–color-lines</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Color line annotations in the default format differently if they come
from the same commit as the preceding line. This makes it easier to
distinguish code blocks introduced by different commits. The color
defaults to cyan and can be adjusted using the
<strong>color.blame.repeatedLines</strong> config option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–color-by-age</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Color line annotations depending on the age of the line in the default
format. The <strong>color.blame.highlightRecent</strong> config option controls what
color is used for each range of age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-h</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show help message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-c</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the same output mode as *git-annotate*(1) (Default: off).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–score-debug</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Include debugging information related to the movement of lines between
files (see <strong>-C</strong>) and lines moved within a file (see <strong>-M</strong>). The first
number listed is the score. This is the number of alphanumeric
characters detected as having been moved between or within files. This
must be above a certain threshold for <em>git blame</em> to consider those
lines of code to have been moved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-f, –show-name</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the filename in the original commit. By default the filename is
shown if there is any line that came from a file with a different name,
due to rename detection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-n, –show-number</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the line number in the original commit (Default: off).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-s</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppress the author name and timestamp from the output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-e, –show-email</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the author email instead of the author name (Default: off). This
can also be controlled via the <strong>blame.showEmail</strong> config option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-w</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore whitespace when comparing the parent&#39;s version and the child&#39;s to
find where the lines came from.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–abbrev=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of using the default 7+1 hexadecimal digits as the abbreviated
object name, use &lt;m&gt;+1 digits, where &lt;m&gt; is at least &lt;n&gt; but ensures the
commit object names are unique. Note that 1 column is used for a caret
to mark the boundary commit.</p>

THE DEFAULT FORMAT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When neither <strong>–porcelain</strong> nor <strong>–incremental</strong> option is specified, <strong>git
blame</strong> will output annotation for each line with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
abbreviated object name for the commit the line came from;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
author ident (by default the author name and date, unless <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-e</strong>
is specified); and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
line number</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
before the line contents.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-6">
THE PORCELAIN FORMAT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>In this format, each line is output after a header; the header at the
minimum has the first line which has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
40-byte SHA-1 of the commit the line is attributed to;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
the line number of the line in the original file;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
the line number of the line in the final file;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
on a line that starts a group of lines from a different commit than the
previous one, the number of lines in this group. On subsequent lines
this field is absent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This header line is followed by the following information at least once
for each commit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
the author name (&#34;author&#34;), email (&#34;author-mail&#34;), time (&#34;author-time&#34;),
and time zone (&#34;author-tz&#34;); similarly for committer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
the filename in the commit that the line is attributed to.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
the first line of the commit log message (&#34;summary&#34;).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The contents of the actual line are output after the above header,
prefixed by a TAB. This is to allow adding more header elements later.</p>
<p>
The porcelain format generally suppresses commit information that has
already been seen. For example, two lines that are blamed to the same
commit will both be shown, but the details for that commit will be shown
only once. This is more efficient, but may require more state be kept by
the reader. The <strong>–line-porcelain</strong> option can be used to output full
commit information for each line, allowing simpler (but less efficient)
usage like:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# count the number of lines attributed to each author
git blame --line-porcelain file |
sed -n s/^author //p |
sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
</pre>
</blockquote>

<div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-7">
SPECIFYING RANGES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Unlike <em>git blame</em> and <em>git annotate</em> in older versions of git, the
extent of the annotation can be limited to both line ranges and revision
ranges. The <strong>-L</strong> option, which limits annotation to a range of lines,
may be specified multiple times.</p>
<p>
When you are interested in finding the origin for lines 40-60 for file
<strong>foo</strong>, you can use the <strong>-L</strong> option like so (they mean the same thing —
both ask for 21 lines starting at line 40):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git blame -L 40,60 foo
git blame -L 40,+21 foo
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Also you can use a regular expression to specify the line range:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git blame -L /^sub hello {/,/^}$/ foo
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
which limits the annotation to the body of the <strong>hello</strong> subroutine.</p>
<p>
When you are not interested in changes older than version v2.6.18, or
changes older than 3 weeks, you can use revision range specifiers
similar to <em>git rev-list</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git blame v2.6.18.. -- foo
git blame --since=3.weeks -- foo
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
When revision range specifiers are used to limit the annotation, lines
that have not changed since the range boundary (either the commit
v2.6.18 or the most recent commit that is more than 3 weeks old in the
above example) are blamed for that range boundary commit.</p>
<p>
A particularly useful way is to see if an added file has lines created
by copy-and-paste from existing files. Sometimes this indicates that the
developer was being sloppy and did not refactor the code properly. You
can first find the commit that introduced the file with:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git log --diff-filter=A --pretty=short -- foo
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
and then annotate the change between the commit and its parents, using
<strong>commit^!</strong> notation:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git blame -C -C -f $commit^! -- foo
</pre>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-8">
INCREMENTAL OUTPUT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When called with <strong>–incremental</strong> option, the command outputs the result
as it is built. The output generally will talk about lines touched by
more recent commits first (i.e. the lines will be annotated out of
order) and is meant to be used by interactive viewers.</p>
<p>
The output format is similar to the Porcelain format, but it does not
contain the actual lines from the file that is being annotated.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Each blame entry always starts with a line of:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
&lt;40-byte-hex-sha1&gt; &lt;sourceline&gt; &lt;resultline&gt; &lt;num-lines&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Line numbers count from 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The first time that a commit shows up in the stream, it has various
other information about it printed out with a one-word tag at the
beginning of each line describing the extra commit information (author,
email, committer, dates, summary, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike the Porcelain format, the filename information is always given
and terminates the entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
&#34;filename&#34; &lt;whitespace-quoted-filename-goes-here&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
and thus it is really quite easy to parse for some line- and
word-oriented parser (which should be quite natural for most scripting
languages).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\\</p>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>
\\
For people who do parsing: to make it more robust, just ignore any lines
between the first and last one (&#34;&lt;sha1&gt;&#34; and &#34;filename&#34; lines) where you
do not recognize the tag words (or care about that particular one) at
the beginning of the &#34;extended information&#34; lines. That way, if there is
ever added information (like the commit encoding or extended commit
commentary), a blame viewer will not care.</p>
