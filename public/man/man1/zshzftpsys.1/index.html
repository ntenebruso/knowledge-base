DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>This describes the set of shell functions supplied with the source
distribution as an interface to the <strong>zftp</strong> builtin command, allowing you
to perform FTP operations from the shell command line or within
functions or scripts. The interface is similar to a traditional FTP
client (e.g. the <strong>ftp</strong> command itself, see /ftp/(1)), but as it is
entirely done within the shell all the familiar completion, editing and
globbing features, and so on, are present, and macros are particularly
simple to write as they are just ordinary shell functions.</p>
<p>
The prerequisite is that the <strong>zftp</strong> command, as described in
/zshmodules/(1) , must be available in the version of <strong>zsh</strong> installed at
your site. If the shell is configured to load new commands at run time,
it probably is: typing `*zmodload zsh/zftp*&#39; will make sure (if that
runs silently, it has worked). If this is not the case, it is possible
<strong>zftp</strong> was linked into the shell anyway: to test this, type `*which
zftp*&#39; and if <strong>zftp</strong> is available you will get the message `*zftp: shell
built-in command*&#39;.</p>
<p>
Commands given directly with <strong>zftp</strong> builtin may be interspersed between
the functions in this suite; in a few cases, using <strong>zftp</strong> directly may
cause some of the status information stored in shell parameters to
become invalid. Note in particular the description of the variables
<strong>$ZFTP_TMOUT</strong>, <strong>$ZFTP_PREFS</strong> and <strong>$ZFTP_VERBOSE</strong> for <strong>zftp</strong>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="headline-3">
INSTALLATION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>You should make sure all the functions from the <strong>Functions/Zftp</strong>
directory of the source distribution are available; they all begin with
the two letters `*zf*&#39;. They may already have been installed on your
system; otherwise, you will need to find them and copy them. The
directory should appear as one of the elements of the <strong>$fpath</strong> array
(this should already be the case if they were installed), and at least
the function <strong>zfinit</strong> should be autoloaded; it will autoload the rest.
Finally, to initialize the use of the system you need to call the
<strong>zfinit</strong> function. The following code in your <strong>.zshrc</strong> will arrange for
this; assume the functions are stored in the directory <strong>~/myfns</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
fpath=(~/myfns $fpath)
autoload -U zfinit
zfinit
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that <strong>zfinit</strong> assumes you are using the <strong>zmodload</strong> method to load
the <strong>zftp</strong> command. If it is already built into the shell, change
<strong>zfinit</strong> to <strong>zfinit -n</strong>. It is helpful (though not essential) if the
call to <strong>zfinit</strong> appears after any code to initialize the new completion
system, else unnecessary <strong>compctl</strong> commands will be given.</p>

FUNCTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The sequence of operations in performing a file transfer is essentially
the same as that in a standard FTP client. Note that, due to a quirk of
the shell&#39;s <strong>getopts</strong> builtin, for those functions that handle options
you must use `*–<strong>&#39; rather than `</strong>-<strong>&#39; to ensure the remaining arguments
are treated literally (a single `</strong>-*&#39; is treated as an argument).</p>

Opening a connection
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p><strong>zfparams</strong> [ <em>host</em> [ <em>user</em> [ <em>password</em> … ] ] ] Set or show the
parameters for a future <strong>zfopen</strong> with no arguments. If no arguments are
given, the current parameters are displayed (the password will be shown
as a line of asterisks). If a <em>host</em> is given, and either the <em>user</em> or
<em>password</em> is not, they will be prompted for; also, any parameter given
as `*?*&#39; will be prompted for, and if the `*?*&#39; is followed by a string,
that will be used as the prompt. As <strong>zfopen</strong> calls <strong>zfparams</strong> to store
the parameters, this usually need not be called directly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A single argument `*-*&#39; will delete the stored parameters. This will
also cause the memory of the last directory (and so on) on the other
host to be deleted.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>zfopen</strong> [ <strong>-1</strong> ] [ <em>host</em> [ <em>user</em> [ <em>password</em> [ <em>account</em> ] ] ]
] :: If <em>host</em> is present, open a connection to that host under
username <em>user</em> with password <em>password</em> (and, on the rare occasions
when it is necessary, account <em>account</em>). If a necessary parameter is
missing or given as `*?*&#39; it will be prompted for. If <em>host</em> is not
present, use a previously stored set of parameters.

If the command was successful, and the terminal is compatible with
<strong>xterm</strong> or is <strong>sun-cmd</strong>, a summary will appear in the title bar,
giving the local <strong>host:directory</strong> and the remote <strong>host:directory</strong>;
this is handled by the function <strong>zftp_chpwd</strong>, described below.

Normally, the <em>host</em>, <em>user</em> and <em>password</em> are internally recorded
for later re-opening, either by a <strong>zfopen</strong> with no arguments, or
automatically (see below). With the option `*-1*&#39;, no information is
stored. Also, if an open command with arguments failed, the parameters
will not be retained (and any previous parameters will also be
deleted). A <strong>zfopen</strong> on its own, or a <strong>zfopen -1</strong>, never alters the
stored parameters.

Both <strong>zfopen</strong> and <strong>zfanon</strong> (but not <strong>zfparams</strong>) understand URLs of the
form *<a href="ftp://*/host///path.../">ftp://*/host///path.../</a> as meaning to connect to the <em>host</em>,
then change directory to <em>path</em> (which must be a directory, not a
file). The `*<a href="ftp://*&#39;">ftp://*&#39;</a> can be omitted; the trailing `*/*&#39; is enough to
trigger recognition of the <em>path</em>. Note prefixes other than `*ftp:*&#39;
are not recognized, and that all characters after the first slash
beyond <em>host</em> are significant in <em>path</em>.</li>
<li><strong>zfanon</strong> [ <strong>-1</strong> ] <em>host</em> :: Open a connection <em>host</em> for anonymous
FTP. The username used is `*anonymous*&#39;. The password (which will be
reported the first time) is generated as <em>user/*@*/host</em>; this is then
stored in the shell parameter <strong>$EMAIL_ADDR</strong> which can alternatively be
set manually to a suitable string.</li>

Directory management
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p><strong>zfcd</strong> [ <em>dir</em> ]</p>
<p>
<strong>zfcd -</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>zfcd</strong> <em>old</em> <em>new</em> Change the current directory on the remote server:
this is implemented to have many of the features of the shell builtin
<strong>cd</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first form with <em>dir</em> present, change to the directory <em>dir</em>. The
command `*zfcd ..*&#39; is treated specially, so is guaranteed to work on
non-UNIX servers (note this is handled internally by <strong>zftp</strong>). If <em>dir</em>
is omitted, has the effect of `*zfcd ~*&#39;.</p>
<p>
The second form changes to the directory previously current.</p>
<p>
The third form attempts to change the current directory by replacing the
first occurrence of the string <em>old</em> with the string <em>new</em> in the
current directory.</p>
<p>
Note that in this command, and indeed anywhere a remote filename is
expected, the string which on the local host corresponds to `*~*&#39; is
converted back to a `*~*&#39; before being passed to the remote machine.
This is convenient because of the way expansion is performed on the
command line before <strong>zfcd</strong> receives a string. For example, suppose the
command is `*zfcd ~/foo*&#39;. The shell will expand this to a full path
such as `*zfcd /home/user2/pws/foo*&#39;. At this stage, <strong>zfcd</strong> recognises
the initial path as corresponding to `*~*&#39; and will send the directory
to the remote host as <strong>~/foo</strong>, so that the `*~*&#39; will be expanded by the
server to the correct remote host directory. Other named directories of
the form `*~name*&#39; are not treated in this fashion.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>zfhere</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Change directory on the remote server to the one
corresponding to the current local directory, with special handling of
`*~*&#39; as in <strong>zfcd</strong>. For example, if the current local directory is
<strong>~/foo/bar</strong>, then <strong>zfhere</strong> performs the effect of `*zfcd ~/foo/bar*&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>zfdir</strong> [ <strong>-rfd</strong> ] [ <strong>-</strong> ] [ <em>dir-options</em> ] [ <em>dir</em> ]
</dt>
<dd>Produce a
long directory listing. The arguments <em>dir-options</em> and <em>dir</em> are
passed directly to the server and their effect is implementation
dependent, but specifying a particular remote directory <em>dir</em> is
usually possible. The output is passed through a pager given by the
environment variable <strong>$PAGER</strong>, or `*more*&#39; if that is not set.

The directory is usually cached for re-use. In fact, two caches are
maintained. One is for use when there is no <em>dir-options</em> or <em>dir</em>,
i.e. a full listing of the current remote directory; it is flushed
when the current remote directory changes. The other is kept for
repeated use of <strong>zfdir</strong> with the same arguments; for example, repeated
use of `*zfdir /pub/gnu*&#39; will only require the directory to be
retrieved on the first call. Alternatively, this cache can be
re-viewed with the <strong>-r</strong> option. As relative directories will confuse
<strong>zfdir</strong>, the <strong>-f</strong> option can be used to force the cache to be flushed
before the directory is listed. The option <strong>-d</strong> will delete both
caches without showing a directory listing; it will also delete the
cache of file names in the current remote directory, if any.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>zfls</strong> [ <em>ls-options</em> ] [ <em>dir</em> ]
</dt>
<dd>List files on the remote server.
With no arguments, this will produce a simple list of file names for
the current remote directory. Any arguments are passed directly to the
server. No pager and no caching is used.</dd>

the types `*A*&#39; or `*ASCII*&#39; for ASCII data and `*B*&#39; or `*BINARY*&#39;,
`*I*&#39; or `*IMAGE*&#39; for binary data are understood case-insensitively.</p>

<dd>Show the status of the current or last
connection, as well as the status of some of <strong>zftp</strong>&#39;s status

Retrieving files
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The commands for retrieving files all take at least two options. <strong>-G</strong>
suppresses remote filename expansion which would otherwise be performed
(see below for a more detailed description of that). <strong>-t</strong> attempts to
set the modification time of the local file to that of the remote file:
see the description of the function <strong>zfrtime</strong> below for more
information.</p>
<p>
<strong>zfget</strong> [ <strong>-Gtc</strong> ] <em>file1</em> … Retrieve all the listed files <em>file1</em> …
one at a time from the remote server. If a file contains a `*/*&#39;, the
full name is passed to the remote server, but the file is stored locally
under the name given by the part after the final `*/*&#39;. The option <strong>-c</strong>
(cat) forces all files to be sent as a single stream to standard output;
in this case the <strong>-t</strong> option has no effect.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>zfuget</strong> [ <strong>-Gvst</strong> ] <em>file1</em> …
</dt>
<dd>As <strong>zfget</strong>, but only retrieve
files where the version on the remote server is newer (has a later
modification time), or where the local file does not exist. If the
remote file is older but the files have different sizes, or if the
sizes are the same but the remote file is newer, the user will usually
be queried. With the option <strong>-s</strong>, the command runs silently and will
always retrieve the file in either of those two cases. With the option
<strong>-v</strong>, the command prints more information about the files while it is
working out whether or not to transfer them.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>zfcget</strong> [ <strong>-Gt</strong> ] <em>file1</em> …
</dt>
<dd>As <strong>zfget</strong>, but if any of the local
files exists, and is shorter than the corresponding remote file, the
command assumes that it is the result of a partially completed
transfer and attempts to transfer the rest of the file. This is useful
on a poor connection which keeps failing.

Note that this requires a commonly implemented, but non-standard,
version of the FTP protocol, so is not guaranteed to work on all
servers.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>zfgcp</strong> [ <strong>-Gt</strong> ] <em>remote-file</em> <em>local-file</em></p>
<p>
<strong>zfgcp</strong> [ <strong>-Gt</strong> ] <em>rfile1</em> … <em>ldir</em> This retrieves files from the
remote server with arguments behaving similarly to the <strong>cp</strong> command.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first form, copy <em>remote-file</em> from the server to the local file
<em>local-file</em>.</p>
<p>
In the second form, copy all the remote files <em>rfile1</em> … into the
local directory <em>ldir</em> retaining the same basenames. This assumes UNIX
directory semantics.</p>

Sending files
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-3">
<p><strong>zfput</strong> [ <strong>-r</strong> ] <em>file1</em> … Send all the <em>file1</em> … given separately
to the remote server. If a filename contains a `*/*&#39;, the full filename
is used locally to find the file, but only the basename is used for the
remote file name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the option <strong>-r</strong>, if any of the <em>files</em> are directories they are
sent recursively with all their subdirectories, including files
beginning with `*.*&#39;. This requires that the remote machine understand
UNIX file semantics, since `*/*&#39; is used as a directory separator.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>zfuput</strong> [ <strong>-vs</strong> ] <em>file1</em> …
</dt>
<dd>As <strong>zfput</strong>, but only send files
which are newer than their remote equivalents, or if the remote file
does not exist. The logic is the same as for <strong>zfuget</strong>, but reversed
between local and remote files.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>zfcput</strong> <em>file1</em> …
</dt>
<dd>As <strong>zfput</strong>, but if any remote file already
exists and is shorter than the local equivalent, assume it is the
result of an incomplete transfer and send the rest of the file to
append to the existing part. As the FTP append command is part of the
standard set, this is in principle more likely to work than <strong>zfcget</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>zfpcp</strong> <em>local-file</em> <em>remote-file</em></p>
<p>
<strong>zfpcp</strong> <em>lfile1</em> … <em>rdir</em> This sends files to the remote server with
arguments behaving similarly to the <strong>cp</strong> command.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With two arguments, copy <em>local-file</em> to the server as <em>remote-file</em>.</p>
<p>
With more than two arguments, copy all the local files <em>lfile1</em> … into
the existing remote directory <em>rdir</em> retaining the same basenames. This
assumes UNIX directory semantics.</p>
<p>
A problem arises if you attempt to use <strong>zfpcp</strong> <em>lfile1</em> <em>rdir</em>, i.e. the
second form of copying but with two arguments, as the command has no
simple way of knowing if <em>rdir</em> corresponds to a directory or a
filename. It attempts to resolve this in various ways. First, if the
<em>rdir</em> argument is `*.*&#39; or `*..*&#39; or ends in a slash, it is assumed to
be a directory. Secondly, if the operation of copying to a remote file
in the first form failed, and the remote server sends back the expected
failure code 553 and a reply including the string `*Is a directory*&#39;,
then <strong>zfpcp</strong> will retry using the second form.</p>

Session management
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-3">
<p><strong>zfsession</strong> [ <strong>-lvod</strong> ] [ <em>sessname</em> ] Allows you to manage multiple FTP
sessions at once. By default, connections take place in a session called
`*default*&#39;; by giving the command `*zfsession* <em>sessname</em>&#39; you can
change to a new or existing session with a name of your choice. The new
session remembers its own connection, as well as associated shell
parameters, and also the host/user parameters set by <strong>zfparams</strong>. Hence
you can have different sessions set up to connect to different hosts,
each remembering the appropriate host, user and password.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With no arguments, <strong>zfsession</strong> prints the name of the current session;
with the option <strong>-l</strong> it lists all sessions which currently exist, and
with the option <strong>-v</strong> it gives a verbose list showing the host and
directory for each session, where the current session is marked with an
asterisk. With <strong>-o</strong>, it will switch to the most recent previous session.</p>
<p>
With <strong>-d</strong>, the given session (or else the current one) is removed;
everything to do with it is completely forgotten. If it was the only
session, a new session called `*default*&#39; is created and made current.
It is safest not to delete sessions while background commands using
<strong>zftp</strong> are active.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>zftransfer</strong> <em>sess1/*:*/file1</em> <em>sess2/*:*/file2</em>
</dt>
<dd>Transfer files
between two sessions; no local copy is made. The file is read from the
session <em>sess1</em> as <em>file1</em> and written to session <em>sess2</em> as file
<em>file2</em>; <em>file1</em> and <em>file2</em> may be relative to the current
directories of the session. Either <em>sess1</em> or <em>sess2</em> may be omitted
(though the colon should be retained if there is a possibility of a
colon appearing in the file name) and defaults to the current session;
<em>file2</em> may be omitted or may end with a slash, in which case the
basename of <em>file1</em> will be added. The sessions <em>sess1</em> and <em>sess2</em>
must be distinct.

The operation is performed using pipes, so it is required that the
connections still be valid in a subshell, which is not the case under
versions of some operating systems, presumably due to a system bug.</dd>

Bookmarks
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The two functions <strong>zfmark</strong> and <strong>zfgoto</strong> allow you to `bookmark&#39; the
present location (host, user and directory) of the current FTP
connection for later use. The file to be used for storing and retrieving
bookmarks is given by the parameter <strong>$ZFTP_BMFILE</strong>; if not set when one
of the two functions is called, it will be set to the file <strong>.zfbkmarks</strong>
in the directory where your zsh startup files live (usually <strong>~</strong>).</p>
<p>
<strong>zfmark</strong> [ <em>bookmark</em> ] If given an argument, mark the current host,
user and directory under the name <em>bookmark</em> for later use by <strong>zfgoto</strong>.
If there is no connection open, use the values for the last connection
immediately before it was closed; it is an error if there was none. Any
existing bookmark under the same name will be silently replaced.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If not given an argument, list the existing bookmarks and the points to
which they refer in the form <em>user/*@*/host/*:*/directory</em>; this is the
format in which they are stored, and the file may be edited directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>zfgoto</strong> [ <strong>-n</strong> ] <em>bookmark</em>
</dt>
<dd>Return to the location given by
<em>bookmark</em>, as previously set by <strong>zfmark</strong>. If the location has user
`*ftp*&#39; or `*anonymous*&#39;, open the connection with <strong>zfanon</strong>, so that
no password is required. If the user and host parameters match those
stored for the current session, if any, those will be used, and again
no password is required. Otherwise a password will be prompted for.

With the option <strong>-n</strong>, the bookmark is taken to be a nickname stored by
the <strong>ncftp</strong> program in its bookmark file, which is assumed to be
<strong>~/.ncftp/bookmarks</strong>. The function works identically in other ways.
Note that there is no mechanism for adding or modifying <strong>ncftp</strong>
bookmarks from the zftp functions.</dd>

Other functions
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Mostly, these functions will not be called directly (apart from
<strong>zfinit</strong>), but are described here for completeness. You may wish to
alter <strong>zftp_chpwd</strong> and <strong>zftp_progress</strong>, in particular.</p>
<p>
<strong>zfinit</strong> [ <strong>-n</strong> ] As described above, this is used to initialize the
zftp function system. The <strong>-n</strong> option should be used if the zftp command
is already built into the shell.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>zfautocheck</strong> [ <strong>-dn</strong> ]
</dt>
<dd>This function is called to implement
automatic reopening behaviour, as described in more detail below. The
options must appear in the first argument; <strong>-n</strong> prevents the command
from changing to the old directory, while <strong>-d</strong> prevents it from
setting the variable <strong>do_close</strong>, which it otherwise does as a flag for
automatically closing the connection after a transfer. The host and
directory for the last session are stored in the variable
<strong>$zflastsession</strong>, but the internal host/user/password parameters must
also be correctly set.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>zfcd_match */prefix/</strong> */suffix/
</dt>
<dd>This performs matching for
completion of remote directory names. If the remote server is UNIX, it
will attempt to persuade the server to list the remote directory with
subdirectories marked, which usually works but is not guaranteed. On
other hosts it simply calls *zfget_match*/ and hence/ completes all
files, not just directories. On some systems, directories may not even
look like filenames.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>zfget_match */prefix/</strong> */suffix/
</dt>
<dd>This performs matching for
completion of remote filenames. It caches files for the current
directory (only) in the shell parameter *$zftp_fcache*/./ It is in the
form to be called by the *-K*/ option of <em><strong>compctl</strong></em>, but/ also works
when called from a widget-style completion function with <em>prefix and
suffix set appropriately.</em></dd>
<dt>
*zfrglob */varname/
</dt>
<dd>Perform remote globbing, as describes in more
detail below. <em>varname</em> is the name of a variable containing the
pattern to be expanded; if there were any matches, the same variable
will be set to the expanded set of filenames on return.</dd>
<dt>
*zfrtime*/ lfile rfile [ time ]/
</dt>
<dd>Set the local file <em>lfile to have
the same modification time as the</em> remote file <em>rfile, or the explicit
time time in FTP format</em> *CCYYMMDDhhmmSS*/ for the GMT timezone. This
uses the shell&#39;s/ *zsh/datetime*/ module to perform the conversion
from/ GMT to local time.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>zftp_chpwd</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This function is called every time a connection is
opened, or closed, or the remote directory changes. This version
alters the title bar of an *xterm*/-compatible or <em><strong>sun-cmd</strong></em> terminal
emulator to reflect the / local and remote hostnames and current
directories. It works best when combined with the function *chpwd*/.
In particular, a function of / the form</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
chpwd() {
  if [[ -n $ZFTP_USER ]]; then
    zftp_chpwd
  else
    # usual chpwd e.g put host:directory in title bar

<strong>zftp_progress</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This function shows the status of the transfer. It
will not write anything unless the output is going to a terminal;
however, if you transfer files in the background, you should turn off
progress reports by hand using `*zstyle &#39;:zftp:*&#39; progress none*/&#39;.
Note also that if you alter it, any/ output <em>must be to standard
error, as standard output may be a file</em> being received. The form of
the progress meter, or whether it is used at all, can be configured
without altering the function, as described in the next section.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>zffcache</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is used to implement caching of files in the
current directory for each session separately. It is used by
*zfget_match*/ and <em><strong>zfrglob</strong></em>./</dd>

Configuration
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Various styles are available using the standard shell style mechanism,
described in <em>zshmodules(1). Briefly, the</em> command `*zstyle &#39;:zftp:*&#39;*/
style value …&#39;./ defines the <em>style to have value value; more than one
value may be</em> given, although that is not useful in the cases described
here. These values will then be used throughout the zftp function
system. For more precise control, the first argument, which gives a
pattern that matches <em>contexts in which the</em> style applies, can be
modified to include a particular function, as for example
`*:zftp:zfget*/&#39;: the style will then have the given value only/ in the
<strong>zfget*/ function, and will override styles set under `/</strong>:zftp:**/&#39;./
Note that only the top level function name, as called by the user, is
used; calling of lower level functions is transparent to the user. Hence
modifications to the title bar in <strong>zftp_chpwd*/ use the/ contexts
*:zftp:zfopen*/, /</strong>:zftp:zfcd*/, etc., depending where it was/ called
from. The following styles are understood:</p>
<p>
<strong>progress</strong> Controls the way that *zftp_progress*/ reports on the
progress of a/ transfer. If empty, unset, or `*none*/&#39;, no progress
report is made; if/ `*bar*/&#39; a growing bar of inverse video is shown; if
`/*percent*/&#39; (or any/ other string, though this may change in future),
the percentage of the file transferred is shown. The bar meter requires
that the width of the terminal be available via the *$COLUMNS*/
parameter (normally this is set/ automatically). If the size of the file
being transferred is not available, *bar*/ and <em><strong>percent</strong></em> meters will
simply show the number of/ bytes transferred so far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When *zfinit*/ is run, if this style is not defined for the context/
*:zftp:**/, it will be set to `bar&#39;./</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>update</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the minimum time interval between updates of the
progress meter in seconds. No update is made unless new data has been
received, so the actual time interval is limited only by
*$ZFTP_TIMEOUT*/./

As described for *progress*/, <em><strong>zfinit</strong></em> will force this to default
to 1./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>remote-glob</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to `*1*/&#39;, `/*yes*/&#39; or `/*true*/&#39;, filename
generation (globbing) is/ performed on the remote machine instead of
by zsh itself; see below.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>titlebar</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to `*1*/&#39;, `/*yes*/&#39; or `/*true*/&#39;,
<em><strong>zftp_chpwd</strong></em> will put the remote host and/ remote directory into the
titlebar of terminal emulators such as xterm or sun-cmd that allow
this.

As described for *progress*/, <em><strong>zfinit</strong></em> will force this to default
to 1./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>chpwd</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set to `*1*/&#39; `/*yes*/&#39; or `/*true*/&#39;, <em><strong>zftp_chpwd</strong></em>
will call the function/ *chpwd*/ when a connection is closed. This is
useful if the remote host/ details were put into the terminal title
bar by *zftp_chpwd*/ and your/ usual *chpwd*/ also modifies the title
bar./

When *zfinit*/ is run, it will determine whether <em><strong>chpwd</strong></em> exists and
if/ so it will set the default value for the style to 1 if none exists
already.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that there is also an associative array *zfconfig*/ which contains/
values used by the function system. This should not be modified or
overwritten.</p>

Remote globbing
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-16" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The commands for retrieving files usually perform filename generation
(globbing) on their arguments; this can be turned off by passing the
option *-G*/ to each of the commands. Normally this operates by
retrieving a/ complete list of files for the directory in question, then
matching these locally against the pattern supplied. This has the
advantage that the full range of zsh patterns (respecting the setting of
the option *EXTENDED_GLOB*/) can be used. However, it means that the
directory part/ of a filename will not be expanded and must be given
exactly. If the remote server does not support the UNIX directory
semantics, directory handling is problematic and it is recommended that
globbing only be used within the current directory. The list of files in
the current directory, if retrieved, will be cached, so that subsequent
globs in the same directory without an intervening *zfcd*/ are much
faster./</p>
<p>
If the *remote-glob*/ style (see above) is set, globbing is instead/
performed on the remote host: the server is asked for a list of matching
files. This is highly dependent on how the server is implemented, though
typically UNIX servers will provide support for basic glob patterns.
This may in some cases be faster, as it avoids retrieving the entire
list of directory contents.</p>

Automatic and temporary reopening
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-17" class="outline-text-3">
<p>As described for the *zfopen*/ command, a subsequent <em><strong>zfopen</strong></em> with no/
parameters will reopen the connection to the last host (this includes
connections made with the *zfanon*/ command). Opened in this fashion,
the/ connection starts in the default remote directory and will remain
open until explicitly closed.</p>
<p>
Automatic re-opening is also available. If a connection is not currently
open and a command requiring a connection is given, the last connection
is implicitly reopened. In this case the directory which was current
when the connection was closed again becomes the current directory
(unless, of course, the command given changes it). Automatic reopening
will also take place if the connection was close by the remote server
for whatever reason (e.g. a timeout). It is not available if the <strong>-1*/
option to /*zfopen</strong> or *zfanon*/ was used./</p>
<p>
Furthermore, if the command issued is a file transfer, the connection
will be closed after the transfer is finished, hence providing a
one-shot mode for transfers. This does not apply to directory changing
or listing commands; for example a *zfdir*/ may reopen a connection but
will leave it/ open. Also, automatic closure will only ever happen in
the same command as automatic opening, i.e a *zfdir*/ directly followed
by a <em><strong>zfget</strong></em> will/ never close the connection automatically.</p>
<p>
Information about the previous connection is given by the <strong>zfstat</strong>
function. So, for example, if that reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
Session:        default
Not connected.
Last session:   ftp.bar.com:/pub/textfiles
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
then the command *zfget file.txt*/ will attempt to reopen a connection
to/ <strong>ftp.bar.com*/, retrieve the file <em><strong>/pub/textfiles/file.txt</strong></em>, and/
immediately close the connection again. On the other hand, *zfcd ..</strong>
will open the connection in the directory */pub*/ and leave it open./</p>
<p>
Note that all the above is local to each session; if you return to a
previous session, the connection for that session is the one which will
be reopened.</p>
