DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Shows the commit logs.</p>
<p>
List commits that are reachable by following the <strong>parent</strong> links from the
given commit(s), but exclude commits that are reachable from the one(s)
given with a <em>^</em> in front of them. The output is given in reverse
chronological order by default.</p>
<p>
You can think of this as a set operation. Commits reachable from any of
the commits given on the command line form a set, and then commits
reachable from any of the ones given with <em>^</em> in front are subtracted
from that set. The remaining commits are what comes out in the command&#39;s
output. Various other options and paths parameters can be used to
further limit the result.</p>
<p>
Thus, the following command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git log foo bar ^baz
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
means &#34;list all the commits which are reachable from <em>foo</em> or <em>bar</em>, but
not from <em>baz</em>&#34;.</p>
<p>
A special notation &#34;<em>&lt;commit1&gt;</em>../&lt;commit2&gt;/&#34; can be used as a
short-hand for &#34;^/&lt;commit1&gt;/ <em>&lt;commit2&gt;</em>&#34;. For example, either of the
following may be used interchangeably:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git log origin..HEAD
$ git log HEAD ^origin
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Another special notation is &#34;<em>&lt;commit1&gt;</em>…/&lt;commit2&gt;/&#34; which is useful
for merges. The resulting set of commits is the symmetric difference
between the two operands. The following two commands are equivalent:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git log A B --not $(git merge-base --all A B)
$ git log A...B
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The command takes options applicable to the *git-rev-list*(1) command to
control what is shown and how, and options applicable to the
*git-diff*(1) command to control how the changes each commit introduces
are shown.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>–follow</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Continue listing the history of a file beyond renames (works only for a
single file).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-decorate, –decorate[=short|full|auto|no]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown. If <em>short</em> is
specified, the ref name prefixes <em>refs/heads/</em>, <em>refs/tags/</em> and
<em>refs/remotes/</em> will not be printed. If <em>full</em> is specified, the full
ref name (including prefix) will be printed. If <em>auto</em> is specified,
then if the output is going to a terminal, the ref names are shown as if
<em>short</em> were given, otherwise no ref names are shown. The option
<strong>–decorate</strong> is short-hand for <strong>–decorate=short</strong>. Default to
configuration value of <strong>log.decorate</strong> if configured, otherwise, <strong>auto</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–decorate-refs=&lt;pattern&gt;, –decorate-refs-exclude=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For each candidate reference, do not use it for decoration if it matches
any patterns given to <strong>–decorate-refs-exclude</strong> or if it doesn&#39;t match
any of the patterns given to <strong>–decorate-refs</strong>. The
<strong>log.excludeDecoration</strong> config option allows excluding refs from the
decorations, but an explicit <strong>–decorate-refs</strong> pattern will override a
match in <strong>log.excludeDecoration</strong>.</p>
<p>
If none of these options or config settings are given, then references
are used as decoration if they match <strong>HEAD</strong>, <strong>refs/heads/</strong>,
<strong>refs/remotes/</strong>, <strong>refs/stash/</strong>, or <strong>refs/tags/</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–clear-decorations</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified, this option clears all previous <strong>–decorate-refs</strong> or
<strong>–decorate-refs-exclude</strong> options and relaxes the default decoration
filter to include all references. This option is assumed if the config
value <strong>log.initialDecorationSet</strong> is set to <strong>all</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–source</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print out the ref name given on the command line by which each commit
was reached.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]mailmap, –[no-]use-mailmap</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use mailmap file to map author and committer names and email addresses
to canonical real names and email addresses. See *git-shortlog*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–full-diff</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without this flag, <strong>git log -p &lt;path&gt;…</strong> shows commits that touch the
specified paths, and diffs about the same specified paths. With this,
the full diff is shown for commits that touch the specified paths; this
means that &#34;&lt;path&gt;…&#34; limits only commits, and doesn&#39;t limit diff for
those commits.</p>
<p>
Note that this affects all diff-based output types, e.g. those produced
by <strong>–stat</strong>, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–log-size</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Include a line “log size &lt;number&gt;” in the output for each commit, where
&lt;number&gt; is the length of that commit&#39;s message in bytes. Intended to
speed up tools that read log messages from <strong>git log</strong> output by allowing
them to allocate space in advance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-L&lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;:&lt;file&gt;, -L:&lt;funcname&gt;:&lt;file&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trace the evolution of the line range given by <em>&lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;</em>, or by
the function name regex <em>&lt;funcname&gt;</em>, within the <em>&lt;file&gt;</em>. You may not
give any pathspec limiters. This is currently limited to a walk starting
from a single revision, i.e., you may only give zero or one positive
revision arguments, and <em>&lt;start&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;end&gt;</em> (or <em>&lt;funcname&gt;</em>) must
exist in the starting revision. You can specify this option more than
once. Implies <strong>–patch</strong>. Patch output can be suppressed using
<strong>–no-patch</strong>, but other diff formats (namely <strong>–raw</strong>, <strong>–numstat</strong>,
<strong>–shortstat</strong>, <strong>–dirstat</strong>, <strong>–summary</strong>, <strong>–name-only</strong>, <strong>–name-status</strong>,
<strong>–check</strong>) are not currently implemented.</p>
<p>
<em>&lt;start&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;end&gt;</em> can take one of these forms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
number</p>
<p>
If <em>&lt;start&gt;</em> or <em>&lt;end&gt;</em> is a number, it specifies an absolute line
number (lines count from 1).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong><em>regex</em></strong></p>
<p>
This form will use the first line matching the given POSIX regex. If
<em>&lt;start&gt;</em> is a regex, it will search from the end of the previous <strong>-L</strong>
range, if any, otherwise from the start of file. If <em>&lt;start&gt;</em> is
<strong>^/regex/</strong>, it will search from the start of file. If <em>&lt;end&gt;</em> is a
regex, it will search starting at the line given by <em>&lt;start&gt;</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
+offset or -offset</p>
<p>
This is only valid for <em>&lt;end&gt;</em> and will specify a number of lines before
or after the line given by <em>&lt;start&gt;</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If <strong>:&lt;funcname&gt;</strong> is given in place of <em>&lt;start&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;end&gt;</em>, it is a
regular expression that denotes the range from the first funcname line
that matches <em>&lt;funcname&gt;</em>, up to the next funcname line. <strong>:&lt;funcname&gt;</strong>
searches from the end of the previous <strong>-L</strong> range, if any, otherwise from
the start of file. <strong>^:&lt;funcname&gt;</strong> searches from the start of file. The
function names are determined in the same way as <strong>git diff</strong> works out
patch hunk headers (see <em>Defining a custom hunk-header</em> in
*gitattributes*(5)).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;revision-range&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show only commits in the specified revision range. When no
&lt;revision-range&gt; is specified, it defaults to <strong>HEAD</strong> (i.e. the whole
history leading to the current commit). <strong>origin..HEAD</strong> specifies all the
commits reachable from the current commit (i.e. <strong>HEAD</strong>), but not from
<strong>origin</strong>. For a complete list of ways to spell &lt;revision-range&gt;, see the
<em>Specifying Ranges</em> section of *gitrevisions*(7).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
[–] &lt;path&gt;…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show only commits that are enough to explain how the files that match
the specified paths came to be. See <em>History Simplification</em> below for
details and other simplification modes.</p>
<p>
Paths may need to be prefixed with <strong>–</strong> to separate them from options or
the revision range, when confusion arises.</p>

Commit Limiting
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the
special notations explained in the description, additional commit
limiting may be applied.</p>
<p>
Using more options generally further limits the output (e.g.
<strong>–since=&lt;date1&gt;</strong> limits to commits newer than <strong>&lt;date1&gt;</strong>, and using it
with <strong>–grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</strong> further limits to commits whose log message has
a line that matches <strong>&lt;pattern&gt;</strong>), unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>
Note that these are applied before commit ordering and formatting
options, such as <strong>–reverse</strong>.</p>
<p>
-&lt;number&gt;, -n &lt;number&gt;, –max-count=&lt;number&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the number of commits to output.</p>

–since=&lt;date&gt;, –after=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show commits more recent than a specific date.</p>

<p>
–since-as-filter=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show all commits more recent than a specific date. This visits all
commits in the range, rather than stopping at the first commit which is
older than a specific date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–until=&lt;date&gt;, –before=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show commits older than a specific date.</p>

<p>
–author=&lt;pattern&gt;, –committer=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header lines that
match the specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
<strong>–author=&lt;pattern&gt;</strong>, commits whose author matches any of the given
patterns are chosen (similarly for multiple <strong>–committer=&lt;pattern&gt;</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–grep-reflog=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the commits output to ones with reflog entries that match the
specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
<strong>–grep-reflog</strong>, commits whose reflog message matches any of the given
patterns are chosen. It is an error to use this option unless
<strong>–walk-reflogs</strong> is in use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the commits output to ones with a log message that matches the
specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
<strong>–grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</strong>, commits whose message matches any of the given
patterns are chosen (but see <strong>–all-match</strong>).</p>
<p>
When <strong>–notes</strong> is in effect, the message from the notes is matched as if
it were part of the log message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–all-match</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the commits output to ones that match all given <strong>–grep</strong>, instead
of ones that match at least one.</p>

<p>
–invert-grep</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the commits output to ones with a log message that do not match
the pattern specified with <strong>–grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-i, –regexp-ignore-case</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Match the regular expression limiting patterns without regard to letter
case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–basic-regexp</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the limiting patterns to be basic regular expressions; this is
the default.</p>

-E, –extended-regexp</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular expressions
instead of the default basic regular expressions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings (don&#39;t interpret
pattern as a regular expression).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-P, –perl-regexp</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the limiting patterns to be Perl-compatible regular
expressions.</p>
<p>
Support for these types of regular expressions is an optional
compile-time dependency. If Git wasn&#39;t compiled with support for them
providing this option will cause it to die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–remove-empty</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop when a given path disappears from the tree.</p>

<p>
–merges</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print only merge commits. This is exactly the same as <strong>–min-parents=2</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-merges</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not print commits with more than one parent. This is exactly the same
as <strong>–max-parents=1</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–min-parents=&lt;number&gt;, –max-parents=&lt;number&gt;, –no-min-parents,
–no-max-parents</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show only commits which have at least (or at most) that many parent
commits. In particular, <strong>–max-parents=1</strong> is the same as <strong>–no-merges</strong>,
<strong>–min-parents=2</strong> is the same as <strong>–merges</strong>. <strong>–max-parents=0</strong> gives all
root commits and <strong>–min-parents=3</strong> all octopus merges.</p>
<p>
<strong>–no-min-parents</strong> and <strong>–no-max-parents</strong> reset these limits (to no
limit) again. Equivalent forms are <strong>–min-parents=0</strong> (any commit has 0
or more parents) and <strong>–max-parents=-1</strong> (negative numbers denote no
upper limit).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–first-parent</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When finding commits to include, follow only the first parent commit
upon seeing a merge commit. This option can give a better overview when
viewing the evolution of a particular topic branch, because merges into
a topic branch tend to be only about adjusting to updated upstream from
time to time, and this option allows you to ignore the individual
commits brought in to your history by such a merge.</p>
<p>
This option also changes default diff format for merge commits to
<strong>first-parent</strong>, see <strong>–diff-merges=first-parent</strong> for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–exclude-first-parent-only</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When finding commits to exclude (with a <em>^</em>), follow only the first
parent commit upon seeing a merge commit. This can be used to find the
set of changes in a topic branch from the point where it diverged from
the remote branch, given that arbitrary merges can be valid topic branch
changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–not</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reverses the meaning of the <em>^</em> prefix (or lack thereof) for all
following revision specifiers, up to the next <strong>–not</strong>. When used on the
command line before –stdin, the revisions passed through stdin will not
be affected by it. Conversely, when passed via standard input, the
revisions passed on the command line will not be affected by it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–all</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all the refs in <strong>refs/</strong>, along with <strong>HEAD</strong>, are listed on
the command line as <em>&lt;commit&gt;</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–branches[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all the refs in <strong>refs/heads</strong> are listed on the command
line as <em>&lt;commit&gt;</em>. If <em>&lt;pattern&gt;</em> is given, limit branches to ones
matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks <em>?</em>, <em>*</em>, or <em>[</em>, <em>/*</em> at
the end is implied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–tags[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all the refs in <strong>refs/tags</strong> are listed on the command line
as <em>&lt;commit&gt;</em>. If <em>&lt;pattern&gt;</em> is given, limit tags to ones matching
given shell glob. If pattern lacks <em>?</em>, <em>*</em>, or <em>[</em>, <em>/*</em> at the end is
implied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–remotes[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all the refs in <strong>refs/remotes</strong> are listed on the command
line as <em>&lt;commit&gt;</em>. If <em>&lt;pattern&gt;</em> is given, limit remote-tracking
branches to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks <em>?</em>, <em>*</em>,
or <em>[</em>, <em>/*</em> at the end is implied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–glob=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all the refs matching shell glob <em>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</em> are
listed on the command line as <em>&lt;commit&gt;</em>. Leading <em>refs/</em>, is
automatically prepended if missing. If pattern lacks <em>?</em>, <em>*</em>, or <em>[</em>,
<em>/*</em> at the end is implied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–exclude=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not include refs matching <em>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</em> that the next <strong>–all</strong>,
<strong>–branches</strong>, <strong>–tags</strong>, <strong>–remotes</strong>, or <strong>–glob</strong> would otherwise
consider. Repetitions of this option accumulate exclusion patterns up to
the next <strong>–all</strong>, <strong>–branches</strong>, <strong>–tags</strong>, <strong>–remotes</strong>, or <strong>–glob</strong>
option (other options or arguments do not clear accumulated patterns).</p>
<p>
The patterns given should not begin with <strong>refs/heads</strong>, <strong>refs/tags</strong>, or
<strong>refs/remotes</strong> when applied to <strong>–branches</strong>, <strong>–tags</strong>, or <strong>–remotes</strong>,
respectively, and they must begin with <strong>refs/</strong> when applied to <strong>–glob</strong>
or <strong>–all</strong>. If a trailing <em>/*</em> is intended, it must be given explicitly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–exclude-hidden=[fetch|receive|uploadpack]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not include refs that would be hidden by <strong>git-fetch</strong>,
<strong>git-receive-pack</strong> or <strong>git-upload-pack</strong> by consulting the appropriate
<strong>fetch.hideRefs</strong>, <strong>receive.hideRefs</strong> or <strong>uploadpack.hideRefs</strong>
configuration along with <strong>transfer.hideRefs</strong> (see <strong>git-config*(1)). This
option affects the next pseudo-ref option *–all</strong> or <strong>–glob</strong> and is
cleared after processing them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–reflog</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all objects mentioned by reflogs are listed on the command
line as <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–alternate-refs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all objects mentioned as ref tips of alternate
repositories were listed on the command line. An alternate repository is
any repository whose object directory is specified in
<strong>objects/info/alternates</strong>. The set of included objects may be modified
by <strong>core.alternateRefsCommand</strong>, etc. See *git-config*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–single-worktree</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, all working trees will be examined by the following options
when there are more than one (see <strong>git-worktree*(1)): *–all</strong>,
<strong>–reflog</strong> and <strong>–indexed-objects</strong>. This option forces them to examine
the current working tree only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignore-missing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon seeing an invalid object name in the input, pretend as if the bad
input was not given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–bisect</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if the bad bisection ref <strong>refs/bisect/bad</strong> was listed and as
if it was followed by <strong>–not</strong> and the good bisection refs
<strong>refs/bisect/good-*</strong> on the command line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–stdin</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to getting arguments from the command line, read them from
standard input as well. This accepts commits and pseudo-options like
<strong>–all</strong> and <strong>–glob=</strong>. When a <strong>–</strong> separator is seen, the following
input is treated as paths and used to limit the result. Flags like
<strong>–not</strong> which are read via standard input are only respected for
arguments passed in the same way and will not influence any subsequent
command line arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–cherry-mark</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like <strong>–cherry-pick</strong> (see below) but mark equivalent commits with <strong>=</strong>
rather than omitting them, and inequivalent ones with <strong>+</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–cherry-pick</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Omit any commit that introduces the same change as another commit on the
“other side” when the set of commits are limited with symmetric
difference.</p>
<p>
For example, if you have two branches, <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, a usual way to list
all commits on only one side of them is with <strong>–left-right</strong> (see the
example below in the description of the <strong>–left-right</strong> option). However,
it shows the commits that were cherry-picked from the other branch (for
example, “3rd on b” may be cherry-picked from branch A). With this
option, such pairs of commits are excluded from the output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–left-only, –right-only</p>
<blockquote>
<p>List only commits on the respective side of a symmetric difference, i.e.
only those which would be marked <strong>&lt;</strong> resp. <strong>&gt;</strong> by <strong>–left-right</strong>.</p>
<p>
For example, <strong>–cherry-pick –right-only A…B</strong> omits those commits from
<strong>B</strong> which are in <strong>A</strong> or are patch-equivalent to a commit in <strong>A</strong>. In
other words, this lists the <strong>+</strong> commits from <strong>git cherry A B</strong>. More
precisely, <strong>–cherry-pick –right-only –no-merges</strong> gives the exact
list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–cherry</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A synonym for <strong>–right-only –cherry-mark –no-merges</strong>; useful to limit
the output to the commits on our side and mark those that have been
applied to the other side of a forked history with <strong>git log –cherry
upstream…mybranch</strong>, similar to <strong>git cherry upstream mybranch</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-g, –walk-reflogs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk reflog entries from
the most recent one to older ones. When this option is used you cannot
specify commits to exclude (that is, <em>^commit</em>, <em>commit1..commit2</em>, and
<em>commit1…commit2</em> notations cannot be used).</p>
<p>
With <strong>–pretty</strong> format other than <strong>oneline</strong> and <strong>reference</strong> (for obvious
reasons), this causes the output to have two extra lines of information
taken from the reflog. The reflog designator in the output may be shown
as <strong>ref@{&lt;Nth&gt;}</strong> (where <em>&lt;Nth&gt;</em> is the reverse-chronological index in
the reflog) or as <strong>ref@{&lt;timestamp&gt;}</strong> (with the <em>&lt;timestamp&gt;</em> for that
entry), depending on a few rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>If the starting point is specified as <strong>ref@{&lt;Nth&gt;}</strong>, show the index
format.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>If the starting point was specified as <strong>ref@{now}</strong>, show the timestamp
format.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>If neither was used, but <strong>–date</strong> was given on the command line, show
the timestamp in the format requested by <strong>–date</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, show the index format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Under <strong>–pretty=oneline</strong>, the commit message is prefixed with this
information on the same line. This option cannot be combined with
<strong>–reverse</strong>. See also *git-reflog*(1).</p>
<p>
Under <strong>–pretty=reference</strong>, this information will not be shown at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–merge</p>
<blockquote>

History Simplification
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history, for example
the commits modifying a particular &lt;path&gt;. But there are two parts of
<em>History Simplification</em>, one part is selecting the commits and the
other is how to do it, as there are various strategies to simplify the
history.</p>
<p>
The following options select the commits to be shown:</p>
<p>
&lt;paths&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commits modifying the given &lt;paths&gt; are selected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–simplify-by-decoration</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commits that are referred by some branch or tag are selected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that extra commits can be shown to give a meaningful history.</p>
<p>
The following options affect the way the simplification is performed:</p>
<p>
Default mode</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simplifies the history to the simplest history explaining the final
state of the tree. Simplest because it prunes some side branches if the
end result is the same (i.e. merging branches with the same content)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–show-pulls</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Include all commits from the default mode, but also any merge commits
that are not TREESAME to the first parent but are TREESAME to a later
parent. This mode is helpful for showing the merge commits that &#34;first
introduced&#34; a change to a branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–full-history</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Same as the default mode, but does not prune some history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–dense</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only the selected commits are shown, plus some to have a meaningful
history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–sparse</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All commits in the simplified history are shown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–simplify-merges</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additional option to <strong>–full-history</strong> to remove some needless merges
from the resulting history, as there are no selected commits
contributing to this merge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ancestry-path[=&lt;commit&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When given a range of commits to display (e.g. <em>commit1..commit2</em> or
<em>commit2 ^commit1</em>), only display commits in that range that are
ancestors of &lt;commit&gt;, descendants of &lt;commit&gt;, or &lt;commit&gt; itself. If
no commit is specified, use <em>commit1</em> (the excluded part of the range)
as &lt;commit&gt;. Can be passed multiple times; if so, a commit is included
if it is any of the commits given or if it is an ancestor or descendant
of one of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A more detailed explanation follows.</p>
<p>
Suppose you specified <strong>foo</strong> as the &lt;paths&gt;. We shall call commits that
modify <strong>foo</strong> !TREESAME, and the rest TREESAME. (In a diff filtered for
<strong>foo</strong>, they look different and equal, respectively.)</p>
<p>
In the following, we will always refer to the same example history to
illustrate the differences between simplification settings. We assume
that you are filtering for a file <strong>foo</strong> in this commit graph:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M---N---O---P---Q
         /     /   /   /   /   /
        I     B   C   D   E   Y
         \   /   /   /   /   /
          `-------------   X
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The horizontal line of history A—Q is taken to be the first parent of
each merge. The commits are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>I</strong> is the initial commit, in which <strong>foo</strong> exists with contents “asdf”,
and a file <strong>quux</strong> exists with contents “quux”. Initial commits are
compared to an empty tree, so <strong>I</strong> is !TREESAME.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
In <strong>A</strong>, <strong>foo</strong> contains just “foo”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>B</strong> contains the same change as <strong>A</strong>. Its merge <strong>M</strong> is trivial and hence
TREESAME to all parents.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>C</strong> does not change <strong>foo</strong>, but its merge <strong>N</strong> changes it to “foobar”, so
it is not TREESAME to any parent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>D</strong> sets <strong>foo</strong> to “baz”. Its merge <strong>O</strong> combines the strings from <strong>N</strong> and
<strong>D</strong> to “foobarbaz”; i.e., it is not TREESAME to any parent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>E</strong> changes <strong>quux</strong> to “xyzzy”, and its merge <strong>P</strong> combines the strings to
“quux xyzzy”. <strong>P</strong> is TREESAME to <strong>O</strong>, but not to <strong>E</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>X</strong> is an independent root commit that added a new file <strong>side</strong>, and <strong>Y</strong>
modified it. <strong>Y</strong> is TREESAME to <strong>X</strong>. Its merge <strong>Q</strong> added <strong>side</strong> to <strong>P</strong>,
and <strong>Q</strong> is TREESAME to <strong>P</strong>, but not to <strong>Y</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>rev-list</strong> walks backwards through history, including or excluding
commits based on whether <strong>–full-history</strong> and/or parent rewriting (via
<strong>–parents</strong> or <strong>–children</strong>) are used. The following settings are
available.</p>
<p>
Default mode</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent (though this
can be changed, see <strong>–sparse</strong> below). If the commit was a merge, and it
was TREESAME to one parent, follow only that parent. (Even if there are
several TREESAME parents, follow only one of them.) Otherwise, follow
all parents.</p>
<p>
This results in:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---N---O
         /     /   /
        I---------D
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is
available, removed <strong>B</strong> from consideration entirely. <strong>C</strong> was considered
via <strong>N</strong>, but is TREESAME. Root commits are compared to an empty tree, so
<strong>I</strong> is !TREESAME.</p>
<p>
Parent/child relations are only visible with <strong>–parents</strong>, but that does
not affect the commits selected in default mode, so we have shown the
parent lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–full-history without parent rewriting</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This mode differs from the default in one point: always follow all
parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them. Even if more
than one side of the merge has commits that are included, this does not
imply that the merge itself is! In the example, we get</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        I  A  B  N  D  O  P  Q
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>M</strong> was excluded because it is TREESAME to both parents. <strong>E</strong>, <strong>C</strong> and
<strong>B</strong> were all walked, but only <strong>B</strong> was !TREESAME, so the others do not
appear.</p>
<p>
Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to talk
about the parent/child relationships between the commits, so we show
them disconnected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–full-history with parent rewriting</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ordinary commits are only included if they are !TREESAME (though this
can be changed, see <strong>–sparse</strong> below).</p>
<p>
Merges are always included. However, their parent list is rewritten:
Along each parent, prune away commits that are not included themselves.
This results in</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M---N---O---P---Q
         /     /   /   /   /
        I     B   /   D   /
         \   /   /   /   /
          `-------------
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Compare to <strong>–full-history</strong> without rewriting above. Note that <strong>E</strong> was
pruned away because it is TREESAME, but the parent list of P was
rewritten to contain <strong>E*s parent *I</strong>. The same happened for <strong>C</strong> and <strong>N</strong>,
and <strong>X</strong>, <strong>Y</strong> and <strong>Q</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In addition to the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME
affects inclusion:</p>
<p>
–dense</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commits that are walked are included if they are not TREESAME to any
parent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–sparse</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All commits that are walked are included.</p>
<p>
Note that without <strong>–full-history</strong>, this still simplifies merges: if one
of the parents is TREESAME, we follow only that one, so the other sides
of the merge are never walked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–simplify-merges</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, build a history graph in the same way that <strong>–full-history</strong> with
parent rewriting does (see above).</p>
<p>
Then simplify each commit <strong>C</strong> to its replacement <strong>C</strong> in the final
history according to the following rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Set <strong>C</strong> to <strong>C</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Replace each parent <strong>P</strong> of <strong>C</strong> with its simplification <strong>P</strong>. In the
process, drop parents that are ancestors of other parents or that are
root commits TREESAME to an empty tree, and remove duplicates, but take
care to never drop all parents that we are TREESAME to.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
If after this parent rewriting, <strong>C</strong> is a root or merge commit (has zero
or &gt;1 parents), a boundary commit, or !TREESAME, it remains. Otherwise,
it is replaced with its only parent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The effect of this is best shown by way of comparing to <strong>–full-history</strong>
with parent rewriting. The example turns into:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M---N---O
         /     /       /
        I     B       D
         \   /       /
          `---------
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note the major differences in <strong>N</strong>, <strong>P</strong>, and <strong>Q</strong> over <strong>–full-history</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>N*s parent list had *I</strong> removed, because it is an ancestor of the other
parent <strong>M</strong>. Still, <strong>N</strong> remained because it is !TREESAME.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>P*s parent list similarly had *I</strong> removed. <strong>P</strong> was then removed
completely, because it had one parent and is TREESAME.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>Q*s parent list had *Y</strong> simplified to <strong>X</strong>. <strong>X</strong> was then removed,
because it was a TREESAME root. <strong>Q</strong> was then removed completely, because
it had one parent and is TREESAME.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is another simplification mode available:</p>
<p>
–ancestry-path[=&lt;commit&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the displayed commits to those which are an ancestor of &lt;commit&gt;,
or which are a descendant of &lt;commit&gt;, or are &lt;commit&gt; itself.</p>
<p>
As an example use case, consider the following commit history:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
            D---E-------F
           /     \       \
          B---C---G---H---I---J
         /                     \
        A-------K---------------L--M
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
A regular <em>D..M</em> computes the set of commits that are ancestors of <strong>M</strong>,
but excludes the ones that are ancestors of <strong>D</strong>. This is useful to see
what happened to the history leading to <strong>M</strong> since <strong>D</strong>, in the sense that
“what does <strong>M</strong> have that did not exist in <strong>D*”. The result in this
example would be all the commits, except *A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> (and <strong>D</strong> itself, of
course).</p>
<p>
When we want to find out what commits in <strong>M</strong> are contaminated with the
bug introduced by <strong>D</strong> and need fixing, however, we might want to view
only the subset of <em>D..M</em> that are actually descendants of <strong>D</strong>, i.e.
excluding <strong>C</strong> and <strong>K</strong>. This is exactly what the <strong>–ancestry-path</strong> option
does. Applied to the <em>D..M</em> range, it results in:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
                E-------F
                 \       \
                  G---H---I---J
                               \
                                L--M
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
We can also use <strong>–ancestry-path=D</strong> instead of <strong>–ancestry-path</strong> which
means the same thing when applied to the <em>D..M</em> range but is just more
explicit.</p>
<p>
If we instead are interested in a given topic within this range, and all
commits affected by that topic, we may only want to view the subset of
<strong>D..M</strong> which contain that topic in their ancestry path. So, using
<strong>–ancestry-path=H D..M</strong> for example would result in:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
                E
                 \
                  G---H---I---J
                               \
                                L--M
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Whereas <strong>–ancestry-path=K D..M</strong> would result in</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
                K---------------L--M
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
Before discussing another option, <strong>–show-pulls</strong>, we need to create a
new example history.</p>
<p>
A common problem users face when looking at simplified history is that a
commit they know changed a file somehow does not appear in the file&#39;s
simplified history. Let&#39;s demonstrate a new example and show how options
such as <strong>–full-history</strong> and <strong>–simplify-merges</strong> works in that case:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M-----C--N---O---P
         /     / \  \  \/   /   /
        I     B   \  R-`-Z   /
         \   /     \/         /
          \ /      /\        /
           `---X--  `---Y--
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
For this example, suppose <strong>I</strong> created <strong>file.txt</strong> which was modified by
<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>X</strong> in different ways. The single-parent commits <strong>C</strong>, <strong>Z</strong>,
and <strong>Y</strong> do not change <strong>file.txt</strong>. The merge commit <strong>M</strong> was created by
resolving the merge conflict to include both changes from <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>
and hence is not TREESAME to either. The merge commit <strong>R</strong>, however, was
created by ignoring the contents of <strong>file.txt</strong> at <strong>M</strong> and taking only
the contents of <strong>file.txt</strong> at <strong>X</strong>. Hence, <strong>R</strong> is TREESAME to <strong>X</strong> but not
<strong>M</strong>. Finally, the natural merge resolution to create <strong>N</strong> is to take the
contents of <strong>file.txt</strong> at <strong>R</strong>, so <strong>N</strong> is TREESAME to <strong>R</strong> but not <strong>C</strong>.
The merge commits <strong>O</strong> and <strong>P</strong> are TREESAME to their first parents, but
not to their second parents, <strong>Z</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> respectively.</p>
<p>
When using the default mode, <strong>N</strong> and <strong>R</strong> both have a TREESAME parent, so
those edges are walked and the others are ignored. The resulting history
graph is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        I---X
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
When using <strong>–full-history</strong>, Git walks every edge. This will discover
the commits <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> and the merge <strong>M</strong>, but also will reveal the
merge commits <strong>O</strong> and <strong>P</strong>. With parent rewriting, the resulting graph
is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M--------N---O---P
         /     / \  \  \/   /   /
        I     B   \  R-`--   /
         \   /     \/         /
          \ /      /\        /
           `---X--  `------
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here, the merge commits <strong>O</strong> and <strong>P</strong> contribute extra noise, as they did
not actually contribute a change to <strong>file.txt</strong>. They only merged a topic
that was based on an older version of <strong>file.txt</strong>. This is a common issue
in repositories using a workflow where many contributors work in
parallel and merge their topic branches along a single trunk: many
unrelated merges appear in the <strong>–full-history</strong> results.</p>
<p>
When using the <strong>–simplify-merges</strong> option, the commits <strong>O</strong> and <strong>P</strong>
disappear from the results. This is because the rewritten second parents
of <strong>O</strong> and <strong>P</strong> are reachable from their first parents. Those edges are
removed and then the commits look like single-parent commits that are
TREESAME to their parent. This also happens to the commit <strong>N</strong>, resulting
in a history view as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M--.
         /     /    \
        I     B      R
         \   /      /
          \ /      /
           `---X--
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In this view, we see all of the important single-parent changes from
<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>X</strong>. We also see the carefully-resolved merge <strong>M</strong> and the
not-so-carefully-resolved merge <strong>R</strong>. This is usually enough information
to determine why the commits <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> &#34;disappeared&#34; from history in
the default view. However, there are a few issues with this approach.</p>
<p>
The first issue is performance. Unlike any previous option, the
<strong>–simplify-merges</strong> option requires walking the entire commit history
before returning a single result. This can make the option difficult to
use for very large repositories.</p>
<p>
The second issue is one of auditing. When many contributors are working
on the same repository, it is important which merge commits introduced a
change into an important branch. The problematic merge <strong>R</strong> above is not
likely to be the merge commit that was used to merge into an important
branch. Instead, the merge <strong>N</strong> was used to merge <strong>R</strong> and <strong>X</strong> into the
important branch. This commit may have information about why the change
<strong>X</strong> came to override the changes from <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> in its commit message.</p>
<p>
–show-pulls</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the commits shown in the default history, show each merge
commit that is not TREESAME to its first parent but is TREESAME to a
later parent.</p>
<p>
When a merge commit is included by <strong>–show-pulls</strong>, the merge is treated
as if it &#34;pulled&#34; the change from another branch. When using
<strong>–show-pulls</strong> on this example (and no other options) the resulting
graph is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        I---X---R---N
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here, the merge commits <strong>R</strong> and <strong>N</strong> are included because they pulled the
commits <strong>X</strong> and <strong>R</strong> into the base branch, respectively. These merges are
the reason the commits <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> do not appear in the default history.</p>
<p>
When <strong>–show-pulls</strong> is paired with <strong>–simplify-merges</strong>, the graph
includes all of the necessary information:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M--.   N
         /     /    \ /
        I     B      R
         \   /      /
          \ /      /
           `---X--
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Notice that since <strong>M</strong> is reachable from <strong>R</strong>, the edge from <strong>N</strong> to <strong>M</strong>
was simplified away. However, <strong>N</strong> still appears in the history as an
important commit because it &#34;pulled&#34; the change <strong>R</strong> into the main
branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <strong>–simplify-by-decoration</strong> option allows you to view only the big
picture of the topology of the history, by omitting commits that are not
referenced by tags. Commits are marked as !TREESAME (in other words,
kept after history simplification rules described above) if (1) they are
referenced by tags, or (2) they change the contents of the paths given
on the command line. All other commits are marked as TREESAME (subject
to be simplified away).</p>

&#34;–oneline&#34;. It also overrides the <strong>log.abbrevCommit</strong> variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–oneline</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a shorthand for &#34;–pretty=oneline –abbrev-commit&#34; used
together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–encoding=&lt;encoding&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commit objects record the character encoding used for the log message in
their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the command to
re-code the commit log message in the encoding preferred by the user.
For non plumbing commands this defaults to UTF-8. Note that if an object
claims to be encoded in <strong>X</strong> and we are outputting in <strong>X</strong>, we will output
the object verbatim; this means that invalid sequences in the original
commit may be copied to the output. Likewise, if iconv(3) fails to
convert the commit, we will quietly output the original object verbatim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–expand-tabs=&lt;n&gt;, –expand-tabs, –no-expand-tabs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perform a tab expansion (replace each tab with enough spaces to fill to
the next display column that is a multiple of <em>&lt;n&gt;</em>) in the log message
before showing it in the output. <strong>–expand-tabs</strong> is a short-hand for
<strong>–expand-tabs=8</strong>, and <strong>–no-expand-tabs</strong> is a short-hand for
<strong>–expand-tabs=0</strong>, which disables tab expansion.</p>
<p>
By default, tabs are expanded in pretty formats that indent the log
message by 4 spaces (i.e. <em>medium</em>, which is the default, <em>full</em>, and
<em>fuller</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–notes[=&lt;ref&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the notes (see <strong>git-notes*(1)) that annotate the commit, when
showing the commit log message. This is the default for *git log</strong>, <strong>git
show</strong> and <strong>git whatchanged</strong> commands when there is no <strong>–pretty</strong>,
<strong>–format</strong>, or <strong>–oneline</strong> option given on the command line.</p>
<p>
By default, the notes shown are from the notes refs listed in the
<strong>core.notesRef</strong> and <strong>notes.displayRef</strong> variables (or corresponding
environment overrides). See *git-config*(1) for more details.</p>
<p>
With an optional <em>&lt;ref&gt;</em> argument, use the ref to find the notes to
display. The ref can specify the full refname when it begins with
<strong>refs/notes/</strong>; when it begins with <strong>notes/</strong>, <strong>refs/</strong> and otherwise
<strong>refs/notes/</strong> is prefixed to form the full name of the ref.</p>
<p>
Multiple –notes options can be combined to control which notes are
being displayed. Examples: &#34;–notes=foo&#34; will show only notes from
&#34;refs/notes/foo&#34;; &#34;–notes=foo –notes&#34; will show both notes from
&#34;refs/notes/foo&#34; and from the default notes ref(s).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-notes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not show notes. This negates the above <strong>–notes</strong> option, by resetting
the list of notes refs from which notes are shown. Options are parsed in
the order given on the command line, so e.g. &#34;–notes –notes=foo
–no-notes –notes=bar&#34; will only show notes from &#34;refs/notes/bar&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–show-notes-by-default</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the default notes unless options for displaying specific notes are
given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–show-notes[=&lt;ref&gt;], –[no-]standard-notes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These options are deprecated. Use the above –notes/–no-notes options
instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–show-signature</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Check the validity of a signed commit object by passing the signature to
<strong>gpg –verify</strong> and show the output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–relative-date</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synonym for <strong>–date=relative</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–date=&lt;format&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only takes effect for dates shown in human-readable format, such as when
using <strong>–pretty</strong>. <strong>log.date</strong> config variable sets a default value for
the log command&#39;s <strong>–date</strong> option. By default, dates are shown in the
original time zone (either committer&#39;s or author&#39;s). If <strong>-local</strong> is
appended to the format (e.g., <strong>iso-local</strong>), the user&#39;s local time zone
is used instead.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=relative</strong> shows dates relative to the current time, e.g. “2
hours ago”. The <strong>-local</strong> option has no effect for <strong>–date=relative</strong>.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=local</strong> is an alias for <strong>–date=default-local</strong>.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=iso</strong> (or <strong>–date=iso8601</strong>) shows timestamps in a ISO 8601-like
format. The differences to the strict ISO 8601 format are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
a space instead of the <strong>T</strong> date/time delimiter</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
a space between time and time zone</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
no colon between hours and minutes of the time zone</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–date=iso-strict</strong> (or <strong>–date=iso8601-strict</strong>) shows timestamps in
strict ISO 8601 format.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=rfc</strong> (or <strong>–date=rfc2822</strong>) shows timestamps in RFC 2822 format,
often found in email messages.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=short</strong> shows only the date, but not the time, in <strong>YYYY-MM-DD</strong>
format.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=raw</strong> shows the date as seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01
00:00:00 UTC), followed by a space, and then the timezone as an offset
from UTC (a <strong>+</strong> or <strong>-</strong> with four digits; the first two are hours, and
the second two are minutes). I.e., as if the timestamp were formatted
with <strong>strftime(&#34;%s %z&#34;)</strong>). Note that the <strong>-local</strong> option does not affect
the seconds-since-epoch value (which is always measured in UTC), but
does switch the accompanying timezone value.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=human</strong> shows the timezone if the timezone does not match the
current time-zone, and doesn&#39;t print the whole date if that matches (ie
skip printing year for dates that are &#34;this year&#34;, but also skip the
whole date itself if it&#39;s in the last few days and we can just say what
weekday it was). For older dates the hour and minute is also omitted.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=unix</strong> shows the date as a Unix epoch timestamp (seconds since
1970). As with <strong>–raw</strong>, this is always in UTC and therefore <strong>-local</strong> has
no effect.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=format:…</strong> feeds the format <strong>…</strong> to your system <strong>strftime</strong>,
except for %s, %z, and %Z, which are handled internally. Use
<strong>–date=format:%c</strong> to show the date in your system locale&#39;s preferred
format. See the <strong>strftime</strong> manual for a complete list of format
placeholders. When using <strong>-local</strong>, the correct syntax is
<strong>–date=format-local:…</strong>.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=default</strong> is the default format, and is based on ctime(3) output.
It shows a single line with three-letter day of the week, three-letter
month, day-of-month, hour-minute-seconds in &#34;HH:MM:SS&#34; format, followed
by 4-digit year, plus timezone information, unless the local time zone
is used, e.g. <strong>Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 1970 +0000</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–parents</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print also the parents of the commit (in the form &#34;commit parent…&#34;).
Also enables parent rewriting, see <em>History Simplification</em> above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–children</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print also the children of the commit (in the form &#34;commit child…&#34;).
Also enables parent rewriting, see <em>History Simplification</em> above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–left-right</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mark which side of a symmetric difference a commit is reachable from.
Commits from the left side are prefixed with <strong>&lt;</strong> and those from the
right with <strong>&gt;</strong>. If combined with <strong>–boundary</strong>, those commits are
prefixed with <strong>-</strong>.</p>
<p>
For example, if you have this topology:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
             y---b---b  branch B
            / \ /
           /   .
          /   / \
         o---x---a---a  branch A
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
you would get an output like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        $ git rev-list --left-right --boundary --pretty=oneline A...B

        &gt;bbbbbbb... 3rd on b
        &gt;bbbbbbb... 2nd on b
        &lt;aaaaaaa... 3rd on a
        &lt;aaaaaaa... 2nd on a
        -yyyyyyy... 1st on b
        -xxxxxxx... 1st on a
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
–graph</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Draw a text-based graphical representation of the commit history on the
left hand side of the output. This may cause extra lines to be printed
in between commits, in order for the graph history to be drawn properly.
Cannot be combined with <strong>–no-walk</strong>.</p>
<p>
This enables parent rewriting, see <em>History Simplification</em> above.</p>
<p>
This implies the <strong>–topo-order</strong> option by default, but the
<strong>–date-order</strong> option may also be specified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–show-linear-break[=&lt;barrier&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When –graph is not used, all history branches are flattened which can
make it hard to see that the two consecutive commits do not belong to a
linear branch. This option puts a barrier in between them in that case.
If <strong>&lt;barrier&gt;</strong> is specified, it is the string that will be shown instead
of the default one.</p>

<p>If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty-format is not <em>oneline</em>,
<em>email</em> or <em>raw</em>, an additional line is inserted before the <em>Author:</em>
line. This line begins with &#34;Merge: &#34; and the hashes of ancestral
commits are printed, separated by spaces. Note that the listed commits
may not necessarily be the list of the <strong>direct</strong> parent commits if you
have limited your view of history: for example, if you are only
interested in changes related to a certain directory or file.</p>
<p>
There are several built-in formats, and you can define additional
formats by setting a pretty.&lt;name&gt; config option to either another
format name, or a <em>format:</em> string, as described below (see
*git-config*(1)). Here are the details of the built-in formats:</p>

<p>
This format is used to refer to another commit in a commit message and
is the same as <strong>–pretty=format:%C(auto)%h (%s, %ad)</strong>. By default, the
date is formatted with <strong>–date=short</strong> unless another <strong>–date</strong> option is
explicitly specified. As with any <strong>format:</strong> with format placeholders,
its output is not affected by other options like <strong>–decorate</strong> and
<strong>–walk-reflogs</strong>.</p>

<em>raw</em></p>
<p>
The <em>raw</em> format shows the entire commit exactly as stored in the commit
object. Notably, the hashes are displayed in full, regardless of whether
–abbrev or –no-abbrev are used, and <em>parents</em> information show the
true parent commits, without taking grafts or history simplification
into account. Note that this format affects the way commits are
displayed, but not the way the diff is shown e.g. with <strong>git log –raw</strong>.
To get full object names in a raw diff format, use <strong>–no-abbrev</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>format:&lt;format-string&gt;</em></p>
<p>
The <em>format:&lt;format-string&gt;</em> format allows you to specify which
information you want to show. It works a little bit like printf format,
with the notable exception that you get a newline with <em>%n</em> instead of
<em>\n</em>.</p>
<p>
E.g, <em>format:&#34;The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was &gt;&gt;%s&lt;&lt;%n&#34;</em>
would show something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
The author of fe6e0ee was Junio C Hamano, 23 hours ago
The title was &gt;&gt;t4119: test autocomputing -p&lt;n&gt; for traditional diff input.&lt;&lt;

<p>\\</p>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>
\\</p>
<p>
Some placeholders may depend on other options given to the revision
traversal engine. For example, the <strong>%g*</strong> reflog options will insert an
empty string unless we are traversing reflog entries (e.g., by <strong>git log
-g</strong>). The <strong>%d</strong> and <strong>%D</strong> placeholders will use the &#34;short&#34; decoration
format if <strong>–decorate</strong> was not already provided on the command line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The boolean options accept an optional value <strong>[=&lt;bool-value&gt;]</strong>. The
values <strong>true</strong>, <strong>false</strong>, <strong>on</strong>, <strong>off</strong> etc. are all accepted. See the
&#34;boolean&#34; sub-section in &#34;EXAMPLES&#34; in *git-config*(1). If a boolean
option is given with no value, it&#39;s enabled.</p>
<p>
If you add a <strong>+</strong> (plus sign) after <em>%</em> of a placeholder, a line-feed is
inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the placeholder
expands to a non-empty string.</p>
<p>
If you add a <strong>-</strong> (minus sign) after <em>%</em> of a placeholder, all
consecutive line-feeds immediately preceding the expansion are deleted
if and only if the placeholder expands to an empty string.</p>
<p>
If you add a ` ` (space) after <em>%</em> of a placeholder, a space is inserted
immediately before the expansion if and only if the placeholder expands
to a non-empty string.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>tformat:</em></p>
<p>
The <em>tformat:</em> format works exactly like <em>format:</em>, except that it
provides &#34;terminator&#34; semantics instead of &#34;separator&#34; semantics. In
other words, each commit has the message terminator character (usually a
newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between entries. This
means that the final entry of a single-line format will be properly
terminated with a new line, just as the &#34;oneline&#34; format does. For
example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git log -2 --pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \
  | perl -pe $_ .= &#34; -- NO NEWLINE\n&#34; unless /\n/
4da45be
7134973 -- NO NEWLINE

$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef \
  | perl -pe $_ .= &#34; -- NO NEWLINE\n&#34; unless /\n/
4da45be
7134973
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In addition, any unrecognized string that has a <strong>%</strong> in it is interpreted
as if it has <strong>tformat:</strong> in front of it. For example, these two are
equivalent:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef
$ git log -2 --pretty=%h 4da45bef
</pre>

-X[&lt;param1,param2,…&gt;], –dirstat[=&lt;param1,param2,…&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output the distribution of relative amount of changes for each
sub-directory. The behavior of <strong>–dirstat</strong> can be customized by passing
it a comma separated list of parameters. The defaults are controlled by
the <strong>diff.dirstat</strong> configuration variable (see *git-config*(1)). The
following parameters are available:</p>
<p>
<strong>changes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have been removed
from the source, or added to the destination. This ignores the amount of
pure code movements within a file. In other words, rearranging lines in
a file is not counted as much as other changes. This is the default
behavior when no parameter is given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>lines</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line-based diff
analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts. (For binary files,
count 64-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no natural concept
of lines). This is a more expensive <strong>–dirstat</strong> behavior than the
<strong>changes</strong> behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a file as
much as other changes. The resulting output is consistent with what you
get from the other <strong>–*stat</strong> options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>files</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files changed.
Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis. This is the
computationally cheapest <strong>–dirstat</strong> behavior, since it does not have to
look at the file contents at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>cumulative</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory as well.
Note that when using <strong>cumulative</strong>, the sum of the percentages reported
may exceed 100%. The default (non-cumulative) behavior can be specified
with the <strong>noncumulative</strong> parameter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;limit&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by default).
Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes are
not shown in the output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring
directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and
accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
<strong>–dirstat=files,10,cumulative</strong>.</p>

<p>Show only the name(s) and status of each changed file. See the
description of the <strong>–diff-filter</strong> option on what the status letters
mean. Just like <strong>–name-only</strong> the file names are often encoded in UTF-8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–submodule[=&lt;format&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify how differences in submodules are shown. When specifying
<strong>–submodule=short</strong> the <em>short</em> format is used. This format just shows
the names of the commits at the beginning and end of the range. When
<strong>–submodule</strong> or <strong>–submodule=log</strong> is specified, the <em>log</em> format is
used. This format lists the commits in the range like <strong>git-submodule*(1)
*summary</strong> does. When <strong>–submodule=diff</strong> is specified, the <em>diff</em> format

not very useful in a review to determine if a block of code was moved
without permutation.</p>

blocks</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and create. This
serves two purposes:</p>
<p>
It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file
not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very few
lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single
deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything
new, and the number <strong>m</strong> controls this aspect of the -B option (defaults
to 60%). <strong>-B/70%</strong> specifies that less than 30% of the original should
remain in the result for Git to consider it a total rewrite (i.e.
otherwise the resulting patch will be a series of deletion and insertion
mixed together with context lines).</p>
<p>
When used with -M, a totally-rewritten file is also considered as the
source of a rename (usually -M only considers a file that disappeared as
the source of a rename), and the number <strong>n</strong> controls this aspect of the
-B option (defaults to 50%). <strong>-B20%</strong> specifies that a change with
addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file&#39;s size are
eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to another
file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-M[&lt;n&gt;], –find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If generating diffs, detect and report renames for each commit. For
following files across renames while traversing history, see <strong>–follow</strong>.
If <strong>n</strong> is specified, it is a threshold on the similarity index (i.e.
amount of addition/deletions compared to the file&#39;s size). For example,
<strong>-M90%</strong> means Git should consider a delete/add pair to be a rename if
more than 90% of the file hasn&#39;t changed. Without a <strong>%</strong> sign, the number
is to be read as a fraction, with a decimal point before it. I.e., <strong>-M5</strong>
becomes 0.5, and is thus the same as <strong>-M50%</strong>. Similarly, <strong>-M05</strong> is the
same as <strong>-M5%</strong>. To limit detection to exact renames, use <strong>-M100%</strong>. The
default similarity index is 50%.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
–find-copies-harder</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For performance reasons, by default, <strong>-C</strong> option finds copies only if
the original file of the copy was modified in the same changeset. This
flag makes the command inspect unmodified files as candidates for the
source of copy. This is a very expensive operation for large projects,
so use it with caution. Giving more than one <strong>-C</strong> option has the same
effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-D, –irreversible-delete</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Omit the preimage for deletes, i.e. print only the header but not the
diff between the preimage and <strong>/dev/null</strong>. The resulting patch is not
meant to be applied with <strong>patch</strong> or <strong>git apply</strong>; this is solely for
people who want to just concentrate on reviewing the text after the
change. In addition, the output obviously lacks enough information to
apply such a patch in reverse, even manually, hence the name of the
option.</p>
<p>
When used together with <strong>-B</strong>, omit also the preimage in the deletion
part of a delete/create pair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-l&lt;num&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>-M</strong> and <strong>-C</strong> options involve some preliminary steps that can detect
subsets of renames/copies cheaply, followed by an exhaustive fallback
portion that compares all remaining unpaired destinations to all
relevant sources. (For renames, only remaining unpaired sources are
relevant; for copies, all original sources are relevant.) For N sources
and destinations, this exhaustive check is O(N^2). This option prevents
the exhaustive portion of rename/copy detection from running if the
number of source/destination files involved exceeds the specified
number. Defaults to diff.renameLimit. Note that a value of 0 is treated
as unlimited.</p>

<p>
–diff-filter=[(A|C|D|M|R|T|U|X|B)…[*]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Select only files that are Added (<strong>A</strong>), Copied (<strong>C</strong>), Deleted (<strong>D</strong>),

(<strong>X</strong>), or have had their pairing Broken (<strong>B</strong>). Any combination of the
filter characters (including none) can be used. When <strong>*</strong> (All-or-none)
is added to the combination, all paths are selected if there is any file
that matches other criteria in the comparison; if there is no file that
matches other criteria, nothing is selected.</p>
<p>
Also, these upper-case letters can be downcased to exclude. E.g.
<strong>–diff-filter=ad</strong> excludes added and deleted paths.</p>
<p>
Note that not all diffs can feature all types. For instance, copied and
renamed entries cannot appear if detection for those types is disabled.</p>

-S&lt;string&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look for differences that change the number of occurrences of the

scripter&#39;s use.</p>
<p>
It is useful when you&#39;re looking for an exact block of code (like a
struct), and want to know the history of that block since it first came
into being: use the feature iteratively to feed the interesting block in
the preimage back into <strong>-S</strong>, and keep going until you get the very first
version of the block.</p>

Binary files are searched as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-G&lt;regex&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look for differences whose patch text contains added/removed lines that

To illustrate the difference between <strong>-S&lt;regex&gt; –pickaxe-regex</strong> and

<p>
While <strong>git log -G&#34;frotz\(nitfol&#34;</strong> will show this commit, <strong>git log
-S&#34;frotz\(nitfol&#34; –pickaxe-regex</strong> will not (because the number of
occurrences of that string did not change).</p>
<p>
Unless <strong>–text</strong> is supplied patches of binary files without a textconv
filter will be ignored.</p>
<p>
See the <em>pickaxe</em> entry in *gitdiffcore*(7) for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–find-object=&lt;object-id&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look for differences that change the number of occurrences of the
specified object. Similar to <strong>-S</strong>, just the argument is different in
that it doesn&#39;t search for a specific string but for a specific object
id.</p>
<p>
The object can be a blob or a submodule commit. It implies the <strong>-t</strong>
option in <strong>git-log</strong> to also find trees.</p>

<p>
–pickaxe-all</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <strong>-S</strong> or <strong>-G</strong> finds a change, show all the changes in that

–pickaxe-regex</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Treat the &lt;string&gt; given to <strong>-S</strong> as an extended POSIX regular expression

</blockquote>
<p>
-O&lt;orderfile&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Control the order in which files appear in the output. This overrides
the <strong>diff.orderFile</strong> configuration variable (see <strong>git-config*(1)). To
cancel *diff.orderFile</strong>, use <strong>-O/dev/null</strong>.</p>
<p>
The output order is determined by the order of glob patterns in
&lt;orderfile&gt;. All files with pathnames that match the first pattern are
output first, all files with pathnames that match the second pattern
(but not the first) are output next, and so on. All files with pathnames
that do not match any pattern are output last, as if there was an
implicit match-all pattern at the end of the file. If multiple pathnames
have the same rank (they match the same pattern but no earlier
patterns), their output order relative to each other is the normal
order.</p>
<p>
&lt;orderfile&gt; is parsed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Blank lines are ignored, so they can be used as separators for
readability.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Lines starting with a hash (&#34;<strong>#</strong>&#34;) are ignored, so they can be used for
comments. Add a backslash (&#34;<strong>\</strong>&#34;) to the beginning of the pattern if it
starts with a hash.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Each other line contains a single pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Patterns have the same syntax and semantics as patterns used for
fnmatch(3) without the FNM_PATHNAME flag, except a pathname also matches
a pattern if removing any number of the final pathname components
matches the pattern. For example, the pattern &#34;<strong>foo*bar</strong>&#34; matches
&#34;<strong>fooasdfbar</strong>&#34; and &#34;<strong>foo/bar/baz/asdf</strong>&#34; but not &#34;<strong>foobarx</strong>&#34;.</p>

contains untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit
recorded in the superproject and can be used to override any settings of
the <em>ignore</em> option in *git-config*(1) or *gitmodules*(5). When
&#34;untracked&#34; is used submodules are not considered dirty when they only
contain untracked content (but they are still scanned for modified

GENERATING PATCH TEXT WITH -P
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Running <strong>git-diff*(1), *git-log*(1), *git-show*(1), *git-diff-index*(1),
*git-diff-tree*(1), or *git-diff-files*(1) with the *-p</strong> option produces
patch text. You can customize the creation of patch text via the
<strong>GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF</strong> and the <strong>GIT_DIFF_OPTS</strong> environment variables (see
<strong>git*(1)), and the *diff</strong> attribute (see *gitattributes*(5)).</p>
<p>
What the -p option produces is slightly different from the traditional
diff format:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It is preceded by a &#34;git diff&#34; header that looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
diff --git a/file1 b/file2
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <strong>a/</strong> and <strong>b/</strong> filenames are the same unless rename/copy is involved.
Especially, even for a creation or a deletion, <strong>/dev/null</strong> is <em>not</em> used
in place of the <strong>a/</strong> or <strong>b/</strong> filenames.</p>
<p>
When a rename/copy is involved, <strong>file1</strong> and <strong>file2</strong> show the name of the
source file of the rename/copy and the name of the file that the
rename/copy produces, respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It is followed by one or more extended header lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
old mode &lt;mode&gt;
new mode &lt;mode&gt;
deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt;
new file mode &lt;mode&gt;
copy from &lt;path&gt;
copy to &lt;path&gt;
rename from &lt;path&gt;
rename to &lt;path&gt;
similarity index &lt;number&gt;
dissimilarity index &lt;number&gt;
index &lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt; &lt;mode&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
File modes are printed as 6-digit octal numbers including the file type
and file permission bits.</p>
<p>
Path names in extended headers do not include the <strong>a/</strong> and <strong>b/</strong>
prefixes.</p>
<p>
The similarity index is the percentage of unchanged lines, and the
dissimilarity index is the percentage of changed lines. It is a rounded
down integer, followed by a percent sign. The similarity index value of
100% is thus reserved for two equal files, while 100% dissimilarity
means that no line from the old file made it into the new one.</p>
<p>
The index line includes the blob object names before and after the
change. The &lt;mode&gt; is included if the file mode does not change;
otherwise, separate lines indicate the old and the new mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>

<p>It is preceded by a &#34;git diff&#34; header, that looks like this (when the
<strong>-c</strong> option is used):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
diff --combined file
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
or like this (when the <strong>–cc</strong> option is used):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
diff --cc file
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It is followed by one or more extended header lines (this example shows
a merge with two parents):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
index &lt;hash&gt;,&lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt;
mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt;
new file mode &lt;mode&gt;
deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <strong>mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt;</strong> line appears only if at least one of
the &lt;mode&gt; is different from the rest. Extended headers with information
about detected content movement (renames and copying detection) are
designed to work with the diff of two &lt;tree-ish&gt; and are not used by
combined diff format.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It is followed by a two-line from-file/to-file header:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
--- a/file
+++ b/file
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Similar to the two-line header for the traditional <em>unified</em> diff
format, <strong>/dev/null</strong> is used to signal created or deleted files.</p>
<p>
However, if the –combined-all-paths option is provided, instead of a
two-line from-file/to-file, you get an N+1 line from-file/to-file
header, where N is the number of parents in the merge commit:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
--- a/file
--- a/file
--- a/file
+++ b/file
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This extended format can be useful if rename or copy detection is
active, to allow you to see the original name of the file in different
parents.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Chunk header format is modified to prevent people from accidentally
feeding it to <strong>patch -p1</strong>. Combined diff format was created for review
of merge commit changes, and was not meant to be applied. The change is
similar to the change in the extended <em>index</em> header:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
@@@ &lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;to-file-range&gt; @@@
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are (number of parents + 1) <strong>@</strong> characters in the chunk header for
combined diff format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Unlike the traditional <em>unified</em> diff format, which shows two files A
and B with a single column that has <strong>-</strong> (minus — appears in A but
removed in B), <strong>+</strong> (plus — missing in A but added to B), or <strong>&#34; &#34;</strong>
(space — unchanged) prefix, this format compares two or more files
file1, file2,… with one file X, and shows how X differs from each of
fileN. One column for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to
note how X&#39;s line is different from it.</p>
<p>
A <strong>-</strong> character in the column N means that the line appears in fileN but
it does not appear in the result. A <strong>+</strong> character in the column N means
that the line appears in the result, and fileN does not have that line
(in other words, the line was added, from the point of view of that
parent).</p>
<p>
In the above example output, the function signature was changed from
both files (hence two <strong>-</strong> removals from both file1 and file2, plus <strong>++</strong>
to mean one line that was added does not appear in either file1 or
file2). Also, eight other lines are the same from file1 but do not
appear in file2 (hence prefixed with <strong>+</strong>).</p>
<p>
When shown by <strong>git diff-tree -c</strong>, it compares the parents of a merge
commit with the merge result (i.e. file1..fileN are the parents). When
shown by <strong>git diff-files -c</strong>, it compares the two unresolved merge
parents with the working tree file (i.e. file1 is stage 2 aka &#34;our
version&#34;, file2 is stage 3 aka &#34;their version&#34;).</p>

DISCUSSION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Git is to some extent character encoding agnostic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
The contents of the blob objects are uninterpreted sequences of bytes.
There is no encoding translation at the core level.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Path names are encoded in UTF-8 normalization form C. This applies to
tree objects, the index file, ref names, as well as path names in
command line arguments, environment variables and config files
(<strong>.git/config</strong> (see *git-config*(1)), *gitignore*(5), *gitattributes*(5)
and *gitmodules*(5)).</p>
<p>
Note that Git at the core level treats path names simply as sequences of
non-NUL bytes, there are no path name encoding conversions (except on
Mac and Windows). Therefore, using non-ASCII path names will mostly work
even on platforms and file systems that use legacy extended ASCII
encodings. However, repositories created on such systems will not work
properly on UTF-8-based systems (e.g. Linux, Mac, Windows) and vice
versa. Additionally, many Git-based tools simply assume path names to be
UTF-8 and will fail to display other encodings correctly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Commit log messages are typically encoded in UTF-8, but other extended
ASCII encodings are also supported. This includes ISO-8859-x, CP125x and
many others, but <em>not</em> UTF-16/32, EBCDIC and CJK multi-byte encodings
(GBK, Shift-JIS, Big5, EUC-x, CP9xx etc.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded in UTF-8,
both the core and Git Porcelain are designed not to force UTF-8 on
projects. If all participants of a particular project find it more
convenient to use legacy encodings, Git does not forbid it. However,
there are a few things to keep in mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>git commit</em> and <em>git commit-tree</em> issue a warning if the commit log
message given to it does not look like a valid UTF-8 string, unless you
explicitly say your project uses a legacy encoding. The way to say this
is to have <strong>i18n.commitEncoding</strong> in <strong>.git/config</strong> file, like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
[i18n]
        commitEncoding = ISO-8859-1
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Commit objects created with the above setting record the value of
<strong>i18n.commitEncoding</strong> in their <strong>encoding</strong> header. This is to help other
people who look at them later. Lack of this header implies that the
commit log message is encoded in UTF-8.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>git log</em>, <em>git show</em>, <em>git blame</em> and friends look at the <strong>encoding</strong>
header of a commit object, and try to re-code the log message into UTF-8
unless otherwise specified. You can specify the desired output encoding
with <strong>i18n.logOutputEncoding</strong> in <strong>.git/config</strong> file, like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
[i18n]
        logOutputEncoding = ISO-8859-1
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you do not have this configuration variable, the value of
<strong>i18n.commitEncoding</strong> is used instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that we deliberately chose not to re-code the commit log message
when a commit is made to force UTF-8 at the commit object level, because
re-coding to UTF-8 is not necessarily a reversible operation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown by the log
command. If <em>short</em> is specified, the ref name prefixes <em>refs/heads/</em>,
<em>refs/tags/</em> and <em>refs/remotes/</em> will not be printed. If <em>full</em> is
specified, the full ref name (including prefix) will be printed. If
<em>auto</em> is specified, then if the output is going to a terminal, the ref
names are shown as if <em>short</em> were given, otherwise no ref names are
shown. This is the same as the <strong>–decorate</strong> option of the <strong>git log</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
log.initialDecorationSet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, <strong>git log</strong> only shows decorations for certain known ref
namespaces. If <em>all</em> is specified, then show all refs as decorations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
log.excludeDecoration</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exclude the specified patterns from the log decorations. This is similar

option can be overridden by the <strong>–decorate-refs</strong> option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
log.diffMerges</p>
<blockquote>

log.follow</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <strong>true</strong>, <strong>git log</strong> will act as if the <strong>–follow</strong> option was used when
a single &lt;path&gt; is given. This has the same limitations as <strong>–follow</strong>,
i.e. it cannot be used to follow multiple files and does not work well
on non-linear history.</p>

<p>
notes.displayRef</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which ref (or refs, if a glob or specified more than once), in addition

from when showing commit messages with the <em>git log</em> family of commands.</p>
<p>
This setting can be overridden with the <strong>GIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF</strong>
environment variable, which must be a colon separated list of refs or
globs.</p>
<p>
A warning will be issued for refs that do not exist, but a glob that
does not match any refs is silently ignored.</p>
<p>
This setting can be disabled by the <strong>–no-notes</strong> option to the <em>git log</em>
family of commands, or by the <strong>–notes=&lt;ref&gt;</strong> option accepted by those
commands.</p>
<p>
The effective value of &#34;core.notesRef&#34; (possibly overridden by
GIT_NOTES_REF) is also implicitly added to the list of refs to be
displayed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When rewriting commits with &lt;command&gt; (currently <strong>amend</strong> or <strong>rebase</strong>),

notes.rewriteMode</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When copying notes during a rewrite (see the &#34;notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;&#34;

Must be one of <strong>overwrite</strong>, <strong>concatenate</strong>, <strong>cat_sort_uniq</strong>, or <strong>ignore</strong>.
Defaults to <strong>concatenate</strong>.</p>
<p>
This setting can be overridden with the <strong>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_MODE</strong>
environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
notes.rewriteRef</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When copying notes during a rewrite, specifies the (fully qualified) ref
whose notes should be copied. May be a glob, in which case notes in all
matching refs will be copied. You may also specify this configuration
several times.</p>
<p>
Does not have a default value; you must configure this variable to
enable note rewriting. Set it to <strong>refs/notes/commits</strong> to enable
rewriting for the default commit notes.</p>
<p>
Can be overridden with the <strong>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF</strong> environment variable.
See <strong>notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;</strong> above for a further description of its
format.</p>
