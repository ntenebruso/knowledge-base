DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Reads the tree information given by &lt;tree-ish&gt; into the index, but does
not actually <strong>update</strong> any of the files it &#34;caches&#34;. (see:
*git-checkout-index*(1))</p>
<p>
Optionally, it can merge a tree into the index, perform a fast-forward
(i.e. 2-way) merge, or a 3-way merge, with the <strong>-m</strong> flag. When used with
<strong>-m</strong>, the <strong>-u</strong> flag causes it to also update the files in the work tree
with the result of the merge.</p>
<p>
Only trivial merges are done by <em>git read-tree</em> itself. Only conflicting
paths will be in an unmerged state when <em>git read-tree</em> returns.</p>

<h2 id="headline-4">
OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>-m</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perform a merge, not just a read. The command will refuse to run if your
index file has unmerged entries, indicating that you have not finished a
previous merge you started.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–reset</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Same as -m, except that unmerged entries are discarded instead of
failing. When used with <strong>-u</strong>, updates leading to loss of working tree
changes or untracked files or directories will not abort the operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-u</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a successful merge, update the files in the work tree with the
result of the merge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-i</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Usually a merge requires the index file as well as the files in the
working tree to be up to date with the current head commit, in order not
to lose local changes. This flag disables the check with the working
tree and is meant to be used when creating a merge of trees that are not
directly related to the current working tree status into a temporary
index file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-n, –dry-run</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Check if the command would error out, without updating the index or the
files in the working tree for real.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-v</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the progress of checking files out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–trivial</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Restrict three-way merge by <em>git read-tree</em> to happen only if there is
no file-level merging required, instead of resolving merge for trivial
cases and leaving conflicting files unresolved in the index.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–aggressive</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Usually a three-way merge by <em>git read-tree</em> resolves the merge for
really trivial cases and leaves other cases unresolved in the index, so
that porcelains can implement different merge policies. This flag makes
the command resolve a few more cases internally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
when one side removes a path and the other side leaves the path
unmodified. The resolution is to remove that path.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
when both sides remove a path. The resolution is to remove that path.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
when both sides add a path identically. The resolution is to add that
path.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
–prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep the current index contents, and read the contents of the named
tree-ish under the directory at <strong>&lt;prefix&gt;</strong>. The command will refuse to
overwrite entries that already existed in the original index file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–index-output=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of writing the results out to <strong>$GIT_INDEX_FILE</strong>, write the
resulting index in the named file. While the command is operating, the
original index file is locked with the same mechanism as usual. The file
must allow to be rename(2)ed into from a temporary file that is created
next to the usual index file; typically this means it needs to be on the
same filesystem as the index file itself, and you need write permission
to the directories the index file and index output file are located in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]recurse-submodules</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using –recurse-submodules will update the content of all active
submodules according to the commit recorded in the superproject by
calling read-tree recursively, also setting the submodules HEAD to be
detached at that commit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-sparse-checkout</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disable sparse checkout support even if <strong>core.sparseCheckout</strong> is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–empty</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of reading tree object(s) into the index, just empty it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-q, –quiet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quiet, suppress feedback messages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;tree-ish#&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The id of the tree object(s) to be read/merged.</p>

MERGING
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>If <strong>-m</strong> is specified, <em>git read-tree</em> can perform 3 kinds of merge, a
single tree merge if only 1 tree is given, a fast-forward merge with 2
trees, or a 3-way merge if 3 or more trees are provided.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-6">
Single Tree Merge
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>If only 1 tree is specified, <em>git read-tree</em> operates as if the user did
not specify <strong>-m</strong>, except that if the original index has an entry for a
given pathname, and the contents of the path match with the tree being
read, the stat info from the index is used. (In other words, the index&#39;s
stat()s take precedence over the merged tree&#39;s).</p>
<p>
That means that if you do a <strong>git read-tree -m &lt;newtree&gt;</strong> followed by a
<strong>git checkout-index -f -u -a</strong>, the <em>git checkout-index</em> only checks out
the stuff that really changed.</p>
<p>
This is used to avoid unnecessary false hits when <em>git diff-files</em> is
run after <em>git read-tree</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-7">
Two Tree Merge
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Typically, this is invoked as <strong>git read-tree -m $H $M</strong>, where $H is the
head commit of the current repository, and $M is the head of a foreign
tree, which is simply ahead of $H (i.e. we are in a fast-forward
situation).</p>
<p>
When two trees are specified, the user is telling <em>git read-tree</em> the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The current index and work tree is derived from $H, but the user may
have local changes in them since $H.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The user wants to fast-forward to $M.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In this case, the <strong>git read-tree -m $H $M</strong> command makes sure that no
local change is lost as the result of this &#34;merge&#34;. Here are the &#34;carry
forward&#34; rules, where &#34;I&#34; denotes the index, &#34;clean&#34; means that index
and work tree coincide, and &#34;exists&#34;/&#34;nothing&#34; refer to the presence of
a path in the specified commit:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        I                   H        M        Result
       -------------------------------------------------------
     0  nothing             nothing  nothing  (does not happen)
     1  nothing             nothing  exists   use M
     2  nothing             exists   nothing  remove path from index
     3  nothing             exists   exists,  use M if &#34;initial checkout&#34;,
                                     H == M   keep index otherwise
                                     exists,  fail
                                     H != M

        clean I==H  I==M
       ------------------
     4  yes   N/A   N/A     nothing  nothing  keep index
     5  no    N/A   N/A     nothing  nothing  keep index

     6  yes   N/A   yes     nothing  exists   keep index
     7  no    N/A   yes     nothing  exists   keep index
     8  yes   N/A   no      nothing  exists   fail
     9  no    N/A   no      nothing  exists   fail

     10 yes   yes   N/A     exists   nothing  remove path from index
     11 no    yes   N/A     exists   nothing  fail
     12 yes   no    N/A     exists   nothing  fail
     13 no    no    N/A     exists   nothing  fail

        clean (H==M)
       ------
     14 yes                 exists   exists   keep index
     15 no                  exists   exists   keep index

        clean I==H  I==M (H!=M)
       ------------------
     16 yes   no    no      exists   exists   fail
     17 no    no    no      exists   exists   fail
     18 yes   no    yes     exists   exists   keep index
     19 no    no    yes     exists   exists   keep index
     20 yes   yes   no      exists   exists   use M
     21 no    yes   no      exists   exists   fail
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In all &#34;keep index&#34; cases, the index entry stays as in the original
index file. If the entry is not up to date, <em>git read-tree</em> keeps the
copy in the work tree intact when operating under the -u flag.</p>
<p>
When this form of <em>git read-tree</em> returns successfully, you can see
which of the &#34;local changes&#34; that you made were carried forward by
running <strong>git diff-index –cached $M</strong>. Note that this does not
necessarily match what <strong>git diff-index –cached $H</strong> would have produced
before such a two tree merge. This is because of cases 18 and 19 — if
you already had the changes in $M (e.g. maybe you picked it up via
e-mail in a patch form), *git diff-index --cached $H* would have told
you about the change before this merge, but it would not show in <strong>git
diff-index –cached $M</strong> output after the two-tree merge.</p>
<p>
Case 3 is slightly tricky and needs explanation. The result from this
rule logically should be to remove the path if the user staged the
removal of the path and then switching to a new branch. That however
will prevent the initial checkout from happening, so the rule is
modified to use M (new tree) only when the content of the index is
empty. Otherwise the removal of the path is kept as long as $H and $M
are the same.</p>

<h3 id="headline-8">
3-Way Merge
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Each &#34;index&#34; entry has two bits worth of &#34;stage&#34; state. stage 0 is the
normal one, and is the only one you&#39;d see in any kind of normal use.</p>
<p>
However, when you do <em>git read-tree</em> with three trees, the &#34;stage&#34;
starts out at 1.</p>
<p>
This means that you can do</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git read-tree -m &lt;tree1&gt; &lt;tree2&gt; &lt;tree3&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
and you will end up with an index with all of the &lt;tree1&gt; entries in
&#34;stage1&#34;, all of the &lt;tree2&gt; entries in &#34;stage2&#34; and all of the &lt;tree3&gt;
entries in &#34;stage3&#34;. When performing a merge of another branch into the
current branch, we use the common ancestor tree as &lt;tree1&gt;, the current
branch head as &lt;tree2&gt;, and the other branch head as &lt;tree3&gt;.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, <em>git read-tree</em> has special-case logic that says: if you
see a file that matches in all respects in the following states, it
&#34;collapses&#34; back to &#34;stage0&#34;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
stage 2 and 3 are the same; take one or the other (it makes no
difference - the same work has been done on our branch in stage 2 and
their branch in stage 3)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
stage 1 and stage 2 are the same and stage 3 is different; take stage 3
(our branch in stage 2 did not do anything since the ancestor in stage 1
while their branch in stage 3 worked on it)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
stage 1 and stage 3 are the same and stage 2 is different take stage 2
(we did something while they did nothing)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <em>git write-tree</em> command refuses to write a nonsensical tree, and it
will complain about unmerged entries if it sees a single entry that is
not stage 0.</p>
<p>
OK, this all sounds like a collection of totally nonsensical rules, but
it&#39;s actually exactly what you want in order to do a fast merge. The
different stages represent the &#34;result tree&#34; (stage 0, aka &#34;merged&#34;),
the original tree (stage 1, aka &#34;orig&#34;), and the two trees you are
trying to merge (stage 2 and 3 respectively).</p>
<p>
The order of stages 1, 2 and 3 (hence the order of three &lt;tree-ish&gt;
command-line arguments) are significant when you start a 3-way merge
with an index file that is already populated. Here is an outline of how
the algorithm works:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
if a file exists in identical format in all three trees, it will
automatically collapse to &#34;merged&#34; state by <em>git read-tree</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
a file that has <em>any</em> difference what-so-ever in the three trees will
stay as separate entries in the index. It&#39;s up to &#34;porcelain policy&#34; to
determine how to remove the non-0 stages, and insert a merged version.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
the index file saves and restores with all this information, so you can
merge things incrementally, but as long as it has entries in stages
1/2/3 (i.e., &#34;unmerged entries&#34;) you can&#39;t write the result. So now the
merge algorithm ends up being really simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
you walk the index in order, and ignore all entries of stage 0, since
they&#39;ve already been done.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
if you find a &#34;stage1&#34;, but no matching &#34;stage2&#34; or &#34;stage3&#34;, you know
it&#39;s been removed from both trees (it only existed in the original
tree), and you remove that entry.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
if you find a matching &#34;stage2&#34; and &#34;stage3&#34; tree, you remove one of
them, and turn the other into a &#34;stage0&#34; entry. Remove any matching
&#34;stage1&#34; entry if it exists too. .. all the normal trivial rules ..</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
You would normally use <em>git merge-index</em> with supplied <em>git
merge-one-file</em> to do this last step. The script updates the files in
the working tree as it merges each path and at the end of a successful
merge.</p>
<p>
When you start a 3-way merge with an index file that is already
populated, it is assumed that it represents the state of the files in
your work tree, and you can even have files with changes unrecorded in
the index file. It is further assumed that this state is &#34;derived&#34; from
the stage 2 tree. The 3-way merge refuses to run if it finds an entry in
the original index file that does not match stage 2.</p>
<p>
This is done to prevent you from losing your work-in-progress changes,
and mixing your random changes in an unrelated merge commit. To
illustrate, suppose you start from what has been committed last to your
repository:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ JC=`git rev-parse --verify &#34;HEAD^0&#34;`
$ git checkout-index -f -u -a $JC
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
You do random edits, without running <em>git update-index</em>. And then you
notice that the tip of your &#34;upstream&#34; tree has advanced since you
pulled from him:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git fetch git://.... linus
$ LT=`git rev-parse FETCH_HEAD`
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Your work tree is still based on your HEAD ($JC), but you have some
edits since. Three-way merge makes sure that you have not added or
modified index entries since $JC, and if you haven&#39;t, then does the
right thing. So with the following sequence:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git read-tree -m -u `git merge-base $JC $LT` $JC $LT
$ git merge-index git-merge-one-file -a
$ echo &#34;Merge with Linus&#34; | \
  git commit-tree `git write-tree` -p $JC -p $LT
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
what you would commit is a pure merge between $JC and $LT without your
work-in-progress changes, and your work tree would be updated to the
result of the merge.</p>
<p>
However, if you have local changes in the working tree that would be
overwritten by this merge, <em>git read-tree</em> will refuse to run to prevent
your changes from being lost.</p>
<p>
In other words, there is no need to worry about what exists only in the
working tree. When you have local changes in a part of the project that
is not involved in the merge, your changes do not interfere with the
merge, and are kept intact. When they <strong>do</strong> interfere, the merge does not
even start (<em>git read-tree</em> complains loudly and fails without modifying
anything). In such a case, you can simply continue doing what you were
in the middle of doing, and when your working tree is ready (i.e. you
have finished your work-in-progress), attempt the merge again.</p>

SPARSE CHECKOUT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Note: The skip-worktree capabilities in <strong>git-update-index*(1) and
*read-tree</strong> predated the introduction of <strong>git-sparse-checkout*(1). Users
are encouraged to use the *sparse-checkout</strong> command in preference to
these plumbing commands for sparse-checkout/skip-worktree related needs.
However, the information below might be useful to users trying to
understand the pattern style used in non-cone mode of the
<strong>sparse-checkout</strong> command.</p>
<p>
&#34;Sparse checkout&#34; allows populating the working directory sparsely. It
uses the skip-worktree bit (see *git-update-index*(1)) to tell Git
whether a file in the working directory is worth looking at.</p>
<p>
<em>git read-tree</em> and other merge-based commands (<em>git merge</em>, <em>git
checkout</em>…) can help maintaining the skip-worktree bitmap and working
directory update. <strong>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</strong> is used to define the
skip-worktree reference bitmap. When <em>git read-tree</em> needs to update the
working directory, it resets the skip-worktree bit in the index based on
this file, which uses the same syntax as .gitignore files. If an entry
matches a pattern in this file, or the entry corresponds to a file
present in the working tree, then skip-worktree will not be set on that
entry. Otherwise, skip-worktree will be set.</p>
<p>
Then it compares the new skip-worktree value with the previous one. If
skip-worktree turns from set to unset, it will add the corresponding
file back. If it turns from unset to set, that file will be removed.</p>
<p>
While <strong>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</strong> is usually used to specify what
files are in, you can also specify what files are <em>not</em> in, using negate
patterns. For example, to remove the file <strong>unwanted</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
/*
!unwanted
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Another tricky thing is fully repopulating the working directory when
you no longer want sparse checkout. You cannot just disable &#34;sparse
checkout&#34; because skip-worktree bits are still in the index and your
working directory is still sparsely populated. You should re-populate
the working directory with the <strong>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</strong> file
content as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
/*
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then you can disable sparse checkout. Sparse checkout support in <em>git
read-tree</em> and similar commands is disabled by default. You need to turn
<strong>core.sparseCheckout</strong> on in order to have sparse checkout support.</p>
