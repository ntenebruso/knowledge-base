DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Use <strong>git stash</strong> when you want to record the current state of the working
directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working
directory. The command saves your local modifications away and reverts
the working directory to match the <strong>HEAD</strong> commit.</p>
<p>
The modifications stashed away by this command can be listed with <strong>git
stash list</strong>, inspected with <strong>git stash show</strong>, and restored (potentially
on top of a different commit) with <strong>git stash apply</strong>. Calling <strong>git
stash</strong> without any arguments is equivalent to <strong>git stash push</strong>. A stash
is by default listed as &#34;WIP on <em>branchname</em> …&#34;, but you can give a
more descriptive message on the command line when you create one.</p>
<p>
The latest stash you created is stored in <strong>refs/stash</strong>; older stashes
are found in the reflog of this reference and can be named using the
usual reflog syntax (e.g. <strong>stash@{0}</strong> is the most recently created
stash, <strong>stash@{1}</strong> is the one before it, <strong>stash@{2.hours.ago}</strong> is also
possible). Stashes may also be referenced by specifying just the stash
index (e.g. the integer <strong>n</strong> is equivalent to <strong>stash@{n}</strong>).</p>

COMMANDS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>push [-p|–patch] [-S|–staged] [-k|–[no-]keep-index]
[-u|–include-untracked] [-a|–all] [-q|–quiet] [(-m|–message)
&lt;message&gt;] [–pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt; [–pathspec-file-nul]] [–]
[&lt;pathspec&gt;…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Save your local modifications to a new <em>stash entry</em> and roll them back
to HEAD (in the working tree and in the index). The &lt;message&gt; part is
optional and gives the description along with the stashed state.</p>
<p>
For quickly making a snapshot, you can omit &#34;push&#34;. In this mode,
non-option arguments are not allowed to prevent a misspelled subcommand
from making an unwanted stash entry. The two exceptions to this are
<strong>stash -p</strong> which acts as alias for <strong>stash push -p</strong> and pathspec
elements, which are allowed after a double hyphen <strong>–</strong> for
disambiguation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
save [-p|–patch] [-S|–staged] [-k|–[no-]keep-index]
[-u|–include-untracked] [-a|–all] [-q|–quiet] [&lt;message&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is deprecated in favour of <em>git stash push</em>. It differs from
&#34;stash push&#34; in that it cannot take pathspec. Instead, all non-option
arguments are concatenated to form the stash message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
list [&lt;log-options&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>List the stash entries that you currently have. Each <em>stash entry</em> is
listed with its name (e.g. <strong>stash@{0}</strong> is the latest entry, <strong>stash@{1}</strong>
is the one before, etc.), the name of the branch that was current when
the entry was made, and a short description of the commit the entry was
based on.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
stash@{0}: WIP on submit: 6ebd0e2... Update git-stash documentation
stash@{1}: On master: 9cc0589... Add git-stash
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The command takes options applicable to the <em>git log</em> command to control
what is shown and how. See *git-log*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
show [-u|–include-untracked|–only-untracked] [&lt;diff-options&gt;]
[&lt;stash&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the changes recorded in the stash entry as a diff between the
stashed contents and the commit back when the stash entry was first
created. By default, the command shows the diffstat, but it will accept
any format known to <em>git diff</em> (e.g., <strong>git stash show -p stash@{1}</strong> to
view the second most recent entry in patch form). If no <strong>&lt;diff-option&gt;</strong>
is provided, the default behavior will be given by the <strong>stash.showStat</strong>,
and <strong>stash.showPatch</strong> config variables. You can also use
<strong>stash.showIncludeUntracked</strong> to set whether <strong>–include-untracked</strong> is
enabled by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pop [–index] [-q|–quiet] [&lt;stash&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remove a single stashed state from the stash list and apply it on top of
the current working tree state, i.e., do the inverse operation of <strong>git
stash push</strong>. The working directory must match the index.</p>
<p>
Applying the state can fail with conflicts; in this case, it is not
removed from the stash list. You need to resolve the conflicts by hand
and call <strong>git stash drop</strong> manually afterwards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
apply [–index] [-q|–quiet] [&lt;stash&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like <strong>pop</strong>, but do not remove the state from the stash list. Unlike
<strong>pop</strong>, <strong>&lt;stash&gt;</strong> may be any commit that looks like a commit created by
<strong>stash push</strong> or <strong>stash create</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
branch &lt;branchname&gt; [&lt;stash&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creates and checks out a new branch named <strong>&lt;branchname&gt;</strong> starting from
the commit at which the <strong>&lt;stash&gt;</strong> was originally created, applies the
changes recorded in <strong>&lt;stash&gt;</strong> to the new working tree and index. If that
succeeds, and <strong>&lt;stash&gt;</strong> is a reference of the form <strong>stash@{&lt;revision&gt;}</strong>,
it then drops the <strong>&lt;stash&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>
This is useful if the branch on which you ran <strong>git stash push</strong> has
changed enough that <strong>git stash apply</strong> fails due to conflicts. Since the
stash entry is applied on top of the commit that was HEAD at the time
<strong>git stash</strong> was run, it restores the originally stashed state with no
conflicts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
clear</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remove all the stash entries. Note that those entries will then be
subject to pruning, and may be impossible to recover (see <em>Examples</em>
below for a possible strategy).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
drop [-q|–quiet] [&lt;stash&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remove a single stash entry from the list of stash entries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
create</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a stash entry (which is a regular commit object) and return its
object name, without storing it anywhere in the ref namespace. This is
intended to be useful for scripts. It is probably not the command you
want to use; see &#34;push&#34; above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
store</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Store a given stash created via <em>git stash create</em> (which is a dangling
merge commit) in the stash ref, updating the stash reflog. This is
intended to be useful for scripts. It is probably not the command you
want to use; see &#34;push&#34; above.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>-a, –all</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is only valid for <strong>push</strong> and <strong>save</strong> commands.</p>
<p>
All ignored and untracked files are also stashed and then cleaned up
with <strong>git clean</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-u, –include-untracked, –no-include-untracked</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When used with the <strong>push</strong> and <strong>save</strong> commands, all untracked files are
also stashed and then cleaned up with <strong>git clean</strong>.</p>
<p>
When used with the <strong>show</strong> command, show the untracked files in the stash
entry as part of the diff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–only-untracked</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is only valid for the <strong>show</strong> command.</p>
<p>
Show only the untracked files in the stash entry as part of the diff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–index</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is only valid for <strong>pop</strong> and <strong>apply</strong> commands.</p>
<p>
Tries to reinstate not only the working tree&#39;s changes, but also the
index&#39;s ones. However, this can fail, when you have conflicts (which are
stored in the index, where you therefore can no longer apply the changes
as they were originally).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-k, –keep-index, –no-keep-index</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is only valid for <strong>push</strong> and <strong>save</strong> commands.</p>
<p>
All changes already added to the index are left intact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-p, –patch</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is only valid for <strong>push</strong> and <strong>save</strong> commands.</p>
<p>
Interactively select hunks from the diff between HEAD and the working
tree to be stashed. The stash entry is constructed such that its index
state is the same as the index state of your repository, and its
worktree contains only the changes you selected interactively. The
selected changes are then rolled back from your worktree. See the
“Interactive Mode” section of <strong>git-add*(1) to learn how to operate the
*–patch</strong> mode.</p>
<p>
The <strong>–patch</strong> option implies <strong>–keep-index</strong>. You can use
<strong>–no-keep-index</strong> to override this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-S, –staged</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is only valid for <strong>push</strong> and <strong>save</strong> commands.</p>
<p>
Stash only the changes that are currently staged. This is similar to
basic <strong>git commit</strong> except the state is committed to the stash instead of
current branch.</p>
<p>
The <strong>–patch</strong> option has priority over this one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is only valid for <strong>push</strong> command.</p>
<p>
Pathspec is passed in <strong>&lt;file&gt;</strong> instead of commandline args. If <strong>&lt;file&gt;</strong>
is exactly <strong>-</strong> then standard input is used. Pathspec elements are
separated by LF or CR/LF. Pathspec elements can be quoted as explained
for the configuration variable <strong>core.quotePath</strong> (see <strong>git-config*(1)).
See also *–pathspec-file-nul</strong> and global <strong>–literal-pathspecs</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–pathspec-file-nul</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is only valid for <strong>push</strong> command.</p>
<p>
Only meaningful with <strong>–pathspec-from-file</strong>. Pathspec elements are
separated with NUL character and all other characters are taken
literally (including newlines and quotes).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-q, –quiet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is only valid for <strong>apply</strong>, <strong>drop</strong>, <strong>pop</strong>, <strong>push</strong>, <strong>save</strong>,
<strong>store</strong> commands.</p>
<p>
Quiet, suppress feedback messages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is only valid for <strong>push</strong> command.</p>
<p>
Separates pathspec from options for disambiguation purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;pathspec&gt;…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is only valid for <strong>push</strong> command.</p>
<p>
The new stash entry records the modified states only for the files that
match the pathspec. The index entries and working tree files are then
rolled back to the state in HEAD only for these files, too, leaving
files that do not match the pathspec intact.</p>
<p>
For more details, see the <em>pathspec</em> entry in *gitglossary*(7).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;stash&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is only valid for <strong>apply</strong>, <strong>branch</strong>, <strong>drop</strong>, <strong>pop</strong>, <strong>show</strong>
commands.</p>
<p>
A reference of the form <strong>stash@{&lt;revision&gt;}</strong>. When no <strong>&lt;stash&gt;</strong> is
given, the latest stash is assumed (that is, <strong>stash@{0}</strong>).</p>

DISCUSSION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>A stash entry is represented as a commit whose tree records the state of
the working directory, and its first parent is the commit at <strong>HEAD</strong> when
the entry was created. The tree of the second parent records the state
of the index when the entry is made, and it is made a child of the
<strong>HEAD</strong> commit. The ancestry graph looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
       .----W
      /    /
-----H----I
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
where <strong>H</strong> is the <strong>HEAD</strong> commit, <strong>I</strong> is a commit that records the state
of the index, and <strong>W</strong> is a commit that records the state of the working
tree.</p>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-7">
EXAMPLES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Pulling into a dirty tree</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are in the middle of something, you learn that there are
upstream changes that are possibly relevant to what you are doing. When
your local changes do not conflict with the changes in the upstream, a
simple <strong>git pull</strong> will let you move forward.</p>
<p>
However, there are cases in which your local changes do conflict with
the upstream changes, and <strong>git pull</strong> refuses to overwrite your changes.
In such a case, you can stash your changes away, perform a pull, and
then unstash, like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git pull
 ...
file foobar not up to date, cannot merge.
$ git stash
$ git pull
$ git stash pop
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
Interrupted workflow</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are in the middle of something, your boss comes in and demands
that you fix something immediately. Traditionally, you would make a
commit to a temporary branch to store your changes away, and return to
your original branch to make the emergency fix, like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# ... hack hack hack ...
$ git switch -c my_wip
$ git commit -a -m &#34;WIP&#34;
$ git switch master
$ edit emergency fix
$ git commit -a -m &#34;Fix in a hurry&#34;
$ git switch my_wip
$ git reset --soft HEAD^
# ... continue hacking ...
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
You can use <em>git stash</em> to simplify the above, like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# ... hack hack hack ...
$ git stash
$ edit emergency fix
$ git commit -a -m &#34;Fix in a hurry&#34;
$ git stash pop
# ... continue hacking ...
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
Testing partial commits</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can use <strong>git stash push –keep-index</strong> when you want to make two or
more commits out of the changes in the work tree, and you want to test
each change before committing:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# ... hack hack hack ...
$ git add --patch foo            # add just first part to the index
$ git stash push --keep-index    # save all other changes to the stash
$ edit/build/test first part
$ git commit -m First part     # commit fully tested change
$ git stash pop                  # prepare to work on all other changes
# ... repeat above five steps until one commit remains ...
$ edit/build/test remaining parts
$ git commit foo -m Remaining parts
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
Saving unrelated changes for future use</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are in the middle of massive changes and you find some
unrelated issue that you don&#39;t want to forget to fix, you can do the
change(s), stage them, and use <strong>git stash push –staged</strong> to stash them
out for future use. This is similar to committing the staged changes,
only the commit ends-up being in the stash and not on the current
branch.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# ... hack hack hack ...
$ git add --patch foo           # add unrelated changes to the index
$ git stash push --staged       # save these changes to the stash
# ... hack hack hack, finish current changes ...
$ git commit -m Massive       # commit fully tested changes
$ git switch fixup-branch       # switch to another branch
$ git stash pop                 # to finish work on the saved changes
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
Recovering stash entries that were cleared/dropped erroneously</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you mistakenly drop or clear stash entries, they cannot be recovered
through the normal safety mechanisms. However, you can try the following
incantation to get a list of stash entries that are still in your
repository, but not reachable any more:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git fsck --unreachable |
grep commit | cut -d\  -f3 |
xargs git log --merges --no-walk --grep=WIP
</pre>
