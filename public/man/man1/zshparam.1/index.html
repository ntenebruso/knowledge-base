DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>A parameter has a name, a value, and a number of attributes. A name may
be any sequence of alphanumeric characters and underscores, or the
single characters `***&#39;, `*@*&#39;, `*#*&#39;, `*?*&#39;, `*-<strong>&#39;, `*$</strong>&#39;, or `*!*&#39;. A
parameter whose name begins with an alphanumeric or underscore is also
referred to as a <em>variable</em>.</p>
<p>
The attributes of a parameter determine the <em>type</em> of its value, often
referred to as the parameter type or variable type, and also control
other processing that may be applied to the value when it is referenced.
The value type may be a <em>scalar</em> (a string, an integer, or a floating
point number), an array (indexed numerically), or an <em>associative</em> array
(an unordered set of name-value pairs, indexed by name, also referred to
as a <em>hash</em>).</p>
<p>
Named scalar parameters may have the <em>exported</em>, <strong>-x</strong>, attribute, to
copy them into the process environment, which is then passed from the
shell to any new processes that it starts. Exported parameters are
called <em>environment variables</em>. The shell also <em>imports</em> environment
variables at startup time and automatically marks the corresponding
parameters as exported. Some environment variables are not imported for
reasons of security or because they would interfere with the correct
operation of other shell features.</p>
<p>
Parameters may also be <em>special</em>, that is, they have a predetermined
meaning to the shell. Special parameters cannot have their type changed
or their readonly attribute turned off, and if a special parameter is
unset, then later recreated, the special properties will be retained.</p>
<p>
To declare the type of a parameter, or to assign a string or numeric
value to a scalar parameter, use the <strong>typeset</strong> builtin.</p>
<p>
The value of a scalar parameter may also be assigned by writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
name=value
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In scalar assignment, <em>value</em> is expanded as a single string, in which
the elements of arrays are joined together; filename expansion is not
performed unless the option <strong>GLOB_ASSIGN</strong> is set.</p>
<p>
When the integer attribute, <strong>-i</strong>, or a floating point attribute, <strong>-E</strong> or
<strong>-F</strong>, is set for <em>name</em>, the <em>value</em> is subject to arithmetic
evaluation. Furthermore, by replacing `*=*&#39; with `*+=*&#39;, a parameter can
be incremented or appended to. See the section `Array Parameters&#39; and
<em>Arithmetic Evaluation</em> (in /zshmisc/(1)) for additional forms of
assignment.</p>
<p>
Note that assignment may implicitly change the attributes of a
parameter. For example, assigning a number to a variable in arithmetic
evaluation may change its type to integer or float, and with
<strong>GLOB_ASSIGN</strong> assigning a pattern to a variable may change its type to
an array.</p>
<p>
To reference the value of a parameter, write `*$*/name/&#39; or
`*${<strong><em>name</em></strong>}*&#39;. See <em>Parameter Expansion</em> in /zshexpn/(1) for complete
details. That section also explains the effect of the difference between
scalar and array assignment on parameter expansion.</p>

<h2 id="headline-3">
ARRAY PARAMETERS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>To assign an array value, write one of:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
set -A name value ...
</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
name=(value ...)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
name=([key]=value ...)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If no parameter <em>name</em> exists, an ordinary array parameter is created.
If the parameter <em>name</em> exists and is a scalar, it is replaced by a new
array.</p>
<p>
In the third form, <em>key</em> is an expression that will be evaluated in
arithmetic context (in its simplest form, an integer) that gives the
index of the element to be assigned with <em>value</em>. In this form any
elements not explicitly mentioned that come before the largest index to
which a value is assigned are assigned an empty string. The indices may
be in any order. Note that this syntax is strict: <strong>[</strong> and <strong>]=</strong> must not
be quoted, and <em>key</em> may not consist of the unquoted string <strong>]=</strong>, but is
otherwise treated as a simple string. The enhanced forms of subscript
expression that may be used when directly subscripting a variable name,
described in the section `Array Subscripts&#39; below, are not available.</p>
<p>
The syntaxes with and without the explicit key may be mixed. An implicit
<em>key</em> is deduced by incrementing the index from the previously assigned
element. Note that it is not treated as an error if latter assignments
in this form overwrite earlier assignments.</p>
<p>
For example, assuming the option <strong>KSH_ARRAYS</strong> is not set, the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
array=(one [3]=three four)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
causes the array variable <strong>array</strong> to contain four elements <strong>one</strong>, an
empty string, <strong>three</strong> and <strong>four</strong>, in that order.</p>
<p>
In the forms where only <em>value</em> is specified, full command line
expansion is performed.</p>
<p>
In the *[*/key/*]=*/value/ form, both <em>key</em> and <em>value</em> undergo all
forms of expansion allowed for single word shell expansions (this does
not include filename generation); these are as performed by the
parameter expansion flag <strong>(e)</strong> as described in <em>zshexpn/(1). Nested
parentheses may surround /value</em> and are included as part of the value,
which is joined into a plain string; this differs from ksh which allows
the values themselves to be arrays. A future version of zsh may support
that. To cause the brackets to be interpreted as a character class for
filename generation, and therefore to treat the resulting list of files
as a set of values, quote the equal sign using any form of quoting.
Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
name=([a-z]&#39;=&#39;*)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
To append to an array without changing the existing values, use one of
the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
name+=(value ...)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
name+=([key]=value ...)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the second form <em>key</em> may specify an existing index as well as an
index off the end of the old array; any existing value is overwritten by
<em>value</em>. Also, it is possible to use *[*/key/*]+=*/value/ to append to
the existing value at that index.</p>
<p>
Within the parentheses on the right hand side of either form of the
assignment, newlines and semicolons are treated the same as white space,
separating individual /value/s. Any consecutive sequence of such
characters has the same effect.</p>
<p>
Ordinary array parameters may also be explicitly declared with:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
typeset -a name
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Associative arrays <em>must</em> be declared before assignment, by using:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
typeset -A name
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
When <em>name</em> refers to an associative array, the list in an assignment is
interpreted as alternating keys and values:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
set -A name key value ...
</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
name=(key value ...)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
name=([key]=value ...)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that only one of the two syntaxes above may be used in any given
assignment; the forms may not be mixed. This is unlike the case of
numerically indexed arrays.</p>
<p>
Every <em>key</em> must have a <em>value</em> in this case. Note that this assigns to
the entire array, deleting any elements that do not appear in the list.
The append syntax may also be used with an associative array:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
name+=(key value ...)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
name+=([key]=value ...)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This adds a new key/value pair if the key is not already present, and
replaces the value for the existing key if it is. In the second form it
is also possible to use *[*/key/*]+=*/value/ to append to the existing
value at that key. Expansion is performed identically to the
corresponding forms for normal arrays, as described above.</p>
<p>
To create an empty array (including associative arrays), use one of:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
set -A name
</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
name=()
</pre>
</blockquote>
<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-4">
Array Subscripts
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Individual elements of an array may be selected using a subscript. A
subscript of the form `*[*/exp/*]*&#39; selects the single element <em>exp</em>,
where <em>exp</em> is an arithmetic expression which will be subject to
arithmetic expansion as if it were surrounded by `*$((<strong>…</strong>))*&#39;. The
elements are numbered beginning with 1, unless the <strong>KSH_ARRAYS</strong> option
is set in which case they are numbered from zero.</p>
<p>
Subscripts may be used inside braces used to delimit a parameter name,
thus `*${foo[2]}*&#39; is equivalent to `*$foo[2]*&#39;. If the <strong>KSH_ARRAYS</strong>
option is set, the braced form is the only one that works, as bracketed
expressions otherwise are not treated as subscripts.</p>
<p>
If the <strong>KSH_ARRAYS</strong> option is not set, then by default accesses to an
array element with a subscript that evaluates to zero return an empty
string, while an attempt to write such an element is treated as an
error. For backward compatibility the <strong>KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT</strong> option can be
set to cause subscript values 0 and 1 to be equivalent; see the
description of the option in /zshoptions/(1).</p>
<p>
The same subscripting syntax is used for associative arrays, except that
no arithmetic expansion is applied to <em>exp</em>. However, the parsing rules
for arithmetic expressions still apply, which affects the way that
certain special characters must be protected from interpretation. See
<em>Subscript Parsing</em> below for details.</p>
<p>
A subscript of the form `*[*]*&#39; or `*[@]*&#39; evaluates to all elements of
an array; there is no difference between the two except when they appear
within double quotes. `*&#34;$foo[*]&#34;*&#39; evaluates to `*&#34;$foo[1] $foo[2]
*...*&#34;*&#39;, whereas `*&#34;$foo[@]&#34;<strong>&#39; evaluates to `</strong>&#34;$foo[1]&#34; &#34;$foo[2]&#34;
<strong>…&#39;. For associative arrays, `</strong>[*]*&#39; or `*[@]*&#39; evaluate to all the
values, in no particular order. Note that this does not substitute the
keys; see the documentation for the `*k*&#39; flag under <em>Parameter
Expansion Flags</em> in <em>zshexpn/(1) for complete details. When an array
parameter is referenced as `*$*/name</em>&#39; (with no subscript) it evaluates
to `*$*/name/*[*]*&#39;, unless the *KSH_ARRAYS* option is set in which case
it evaluates to `*${<strong><em>name</em></strong>[0]}*&#39; (for an associative array, this means
the value of the key `*0*&#39;, which may not exist even if there are values
for other keys).</p>
<p>
A subscript of the form `*[*/exp1/*,*/exp2/*]*&#39; selects all elements in
the range <em>exp1</em> to <em>exp2</em>, inclusive. (Associative arrays are
unordered, and so do not support ranges.) If one of the subscripts
evaluates to a negative number, say <strong>-*/n/, then the /n/th element from
the end of the array is used. Thus `*$foo[-3]</strong>&#39; is the third element
from the end of the array <strong>foo</strong>, and `*$foo[1,-1]*&#39; is the same as
`*$foo[*]*&#39;.</p>
<p>
Subscripting may also be performed on non-array values, in which case
the subscripts specify a substring to be extracted. For example, if
<strong>FOO</strong> is set to `*foobar*&#39;, then `*echo $FOO[2,5]*&#39; prints `*ooba*&#39;.
Note that some forms of subscripting described below perform pattern
matching, and in that case the substring extends from the start of the
match of the first subscript to the end of the match of the second
subscript. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
string=&#34;abcdefghijklm&#34;
print ${string[(r)d?,(r)h?]}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
prints `*defghi*&#39;. This is an obvious generalisation of the rule for
single-character matches. For a single subscript, only a single
character is referenced (not the range of characters covered by the
match).</p>
<p>
Note that in substring operations the second subscript is handled
differently by the <strong>r</strong> and <strong>R</strong> subscript flags: the former takes the
shortest match as the length and the latter the longest match. Hence in
the former case a <strong>*</strong> at the end is redundant while in the latter case
it matches the whole remainder of the string. This does not affect the
result of the single subscript case as here the length of the match is
irrelevant.</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-5">
Array Element Assignment
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>A subscript may be used on the left side of an assignment like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
name[exp]=value
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In this form of assignment the element or range specified by <em>exp</em> is
replaced by the expression on the right side. An array (but not an
associative array) may be created by assignment to a range or element.
Arrays do not nest, so assigning a parenthesized list of values to an
element or range changes the number of elements in the array, shifting
the other elements to accommodate the new values. (This is not supported
for associative arrays.)</p>
<p>
This syntax also works as an argument to the <strong>typeset</strong> command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
typeset &#34;name[exp]&#34;=value
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <em>value</em> may <em>not</em> be a parenthesized list in this case; only
single-element assignments may be made with <strong>typeset</strong>. Note that quotes
are necessary in this case to prevent the brackets from being
interpreted as filename generation operators. The <strong>noglob</strong> precommand
modifier could be used instead.</p>
<p>
To delete an element of an ordinary array, assign `*()*&#39; to that
element. To delete an element of an associative array, use the <strong>unset</strong>
command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
unset &#34;name[exp]&#34;
</pre>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-6">
Subscript Flags
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>If the opening bracket, or the comma in a range, in any subscript
expression is directly followed by an opening parenthesis, the string up
to the matching closing one is considered to be a list of flags, as in
`/name/*[(<strong><em>flags</em></strong>)*/exp/*]*&#39;.</p>
<p>
The flags <strong>s</strong>, <strong>n</strong> and <strong>b</strong> take an argument; the delimiter is shown
below as `*:*&#39;, but any character, or the matching pairs `*(<strong>…</strong>)*&#39;,
`*{<strong>…</strong>}*&#39;, `*[*…*]*&#39;, or `*&lt;*…*&gt;*&#39;, may be used, but note that
`*&lt;*…*&gt;*&#39; can only be used if the subscript is inside a double quoted
expression or a parameter substitution enclosed in braces as otherwise
the expression is interpreted as a redirection.</p>
<p>
The flags currently understood are:</p>
<p>
<strong>w</strong> If the parameter subscripted is a scalar then this flag makes
subscripting work on words instead of characters. The default word
separator is whitespace. When combined with the <strong>i</strong> or <strong>I</strong> flag, the
effect is to produce the index of the first character of the first/last
word which matches the given pattern; note that a failed match in this
case always yields 0.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>s:*/string/</strong>:*
</dt>
<dd>This gives the <em>string</em> that separates words (for
use with the <strong>w</strong> flag). The delimiter character <strong>:</strong> is arbitrary; see
above.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>p</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Recognize the same escape sequences as the <strong>print</strong> builtin in
the string argument of a subsequent `*s*&#39; flag.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>f</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If the parameter subscripted is a scalar then this flag makes
subscripting work on lines instead of characters, i.e. with elements
separated by newlines. This is a shorthand for `*pws:\n:*&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>r</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Reverse subscripting: if this flag is given, the <em>exp</em> is taken
as a pattern and the result is the first matching array element,
substring or word (if the parameter is an array, if it is a scalar, or
if it is a scalar and the `*w*&#39; flag is given, respectively). The
subscript used is the number of the matching element, so that pairs of
subscripts such as `*$foo[(r)??,3]*&#39; and `*$foo[(r)??,(r)f*]*&#39; are
possible if the parameter is not an associative array. If the
parameter is an associative array, only the value part of each pair is
compared to the pattern, and the result is that value.</p>
<p>
If a search through an ordinary array failed, the search sets the
subscript to one past the end of the array, and hence
<strong>${array[(r)*/pattern/*]}</strong> will substitute the empty string. Thus the
success of a search can be tested by using the <strong>(i)</strong> flag, for example
(assuming the option <strong>KSH_ARRAYS</strong> is not in effect):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
[[ ${array[(i)pattern]} -le ${#array} ]]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If <strong>KSH_ARRAYS</strong> is in effect, the <strong>-le</strong> should be replaced by <strong>-lt</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>R</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Like `*r*&#39;, but gives the last match. For associative arrays,
gives all possible matches. May be used for assigning to ordinary
array elements, but not for assigning to associative arrays. On
failure, for normal arrays this has the effect of returning the
element corresponding to subscript 0; this is empty unless one of the
options <strong>KSH_ARRAYS</strong> or <strong>KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT</strong> is in effect.</p>
<p>
Note that in subscripts with both `*r*&#39; and `*R*&#39; pattern characters
are active even if they were substituted for a parameter (regardless
of the setting of <strong>GLOB_SUBST</strong> which controls this feature in normal
pattern matching). The flag `*e*&#39; can be added to inhibit pattern
matching. As this flag does not inhibit other forms of substitution,
care is still required; using a parameter to hold the key has the
desired effect:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
key2=&#39;original key&#39;
print ${array[(Re)$key2]}
</pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>i</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Like `*r*&#39;, but gives the index of the match instead; this may
not be combined with a second argument. On the left side of an
assignment, behaves like `*r*&#39;. For associative arrays, the key part
of each pair is compared to the pattern, and the first matching key
found is the result. On failure substitutes the length of the array
plus one, as discussed under the description of `*r*&#39;, or the empty
string for an associative array.

Note: Although `*i*&#39; may be applied to a scalar substitution to find
the offset of a substring, the results are likely to be misleading
when searching within substitutions that yield an empty string, or
when searching for the empty substring.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>I</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Like `*i*&#39;, but gives the index of the last match, or all
possible matching keys in an associative array. On failure substitutes
0, or the empty string for an associative array. This flag is best
when testing for values or keys that do not exist.

Note: If the option <strong>KSH_ARRAYS</strong> is in effect and no match is found,
the result is indistinguishable from the case when the first element
of the array matches.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>k</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If used in a subscript on an associative array, this flag
causes the keys to be interpreted as patterns, and returns the value
for the first key found where <em>exp</em> is matched by the key. Note this
could be any such key as no ordering of associative arrays is defined.
This flag does not work on the left side of an assignment to an
associative array element. If used on another type of parameter, this
behaves like `*r*&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>K</strong>
</dt>
<dd>On an associative array this is like `*k*&#39; but returns all
values where <em>exp</em> is matched by the keys. On other types of
parameters this has the same effect as `*R*&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>n:*/expr/</strong>:*
</dt>
<dd>If combined with `*r*&#39;, `*R*&#39;, `*i*&#39; or `*I*&#39;, makes
them give the <em>n/th or /n/th last match (if /expr</em> evaluates to <em>n</em>).
This flag is ignored when the array is associative. The delimiter
character <strong>:</strong> is arbitrary; see above.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>b:*/expr/</strong>:*
</dt>
<dd>If combined with `*r*&#39;, `*R*&#39;, `*i*&#39; or `*I*&#39;, makes
them begin at the <em>n/th or /n/th last element, word, or character (if
/expr</em> evaluates to <em>n</em>). This flag is ignored when the array is
associative. The delimiter character <strong>:</strong> is arbitrary; see above.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>e</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This flag causes any pattern matching that would be performed
on the subscript to use plain string matching instead. Hence
`*${array[(re)*]}*&#39; matches only the array element whose value is <strong>*</strong>.
Note that other forms of substitution such as parameter substitution
are not inhibited.

This flag can also be used to force <strong>*</strong> or <strong>@</strong> to be interpreted as a
single key rather than as a reference to all values. It may be used
for either purpose on the left side of an assignment.</dd>

Subscript Parsing
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>This discussion applies mainly to associative array key strings and to
patterns used for reverse subscripting (the `*r*&#39;, `*R*&#39;, `*i*&#39;, etc.
flags), but it may also affect parameter substitutions that appear as
part of an arithmetic expression in an ordinary subscript.</p>
<p>
To avoid subscript parsing limitations in assignments to associative
array elements, use the append syntax:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
aa+=(&#39;key with &#34;*strange*&#34; characters&#39; &#39;value string&#39;)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The basic rule to remember when writing a subscript expression is that
all text between the opening `*[*&#39; and the closing `*]*&#39; is interpreted
<em>as if</em> it were in double quotes (see /zshmisc/(1)). However, unlike
double quotes which normally cannot nest, subscript expressions may
appear inside double-quoted strings or inside other subscript
expressions (or both!), so the rules have two important differences.</p>
<p>
The first difference is that brackets (`*[*&#39; and `*]*&#39;) must appear as
balanced pairs in a subscript expression unless they are preceded by a
backslash (`*\*&#39;). Therefore, within a subscript expression (and unlike
true double-quoting) the sequence `*\[*&#39; becomes `*[*&#39;, and similarly
`*\]*&#39; becomes `*]*&#39;. This applies even in cases where a backslash is
not normally required; for example, the pattern `*[^[]*&#39; (to match any
character other than an open bracket) should be written `*[^\[]*&#39; in a
reverse-subscript pattern. However, note that `*\[^\[\]*&#39; and even
`*\[^[]*&#39; mean the <em>same</em> thing, because backslashes are always stripped
when they appear before brackets!</p>
<p>
The same rule applies to parentheses (`*(<strong>&#39; and `</strong>)*&#39;) and braces (`*{<strong>&#39;
and `</strong>}*&#39;): they must appear either in balanced pairs or preceded by a
backslash, and backslashes that protect parentheses or braces are
removed during parsing. This is because parameter expansions may be
surrounded by balanced braces, and subscript flags are introduced by
balanced parentheses.</p>
<p>
The second difference is that a double-quote (`*&#34;*&#39;) may appear as part
of a subscript expression without being preceded by a backslash, and
therefore that the two characters `*\&#34;<strong>&#39; remain as two characters in the
subscript (in true double-quoting, `</strong>\&#34;<strong>&#39; becomes `</strong>&#34;*&#39;). However,
because of the standard shell quoting rules, any double-quotes that
appear must occur in balanced pairs unless preceded by a backslash. This
makes it more difficult to write a subscript expression that contains an
odd number of double-quote characters, but the reason for this
difference is so that when a subscript expression appears inside true
double-quotes, one can still write `*\&#34;<strong>&#39; (rather than `</strong>\\\&#34;<strong>&#39;) for
`</strong>&#34;*&#39;.</p>
<p>
To use an odd number of double quotes as a key in an assignment, use the
<strong>typeset</strong> builtin and an enclosing pair of double quotes; to refer to
the value of that key, again use double quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
typeset -A aa
typeset &#34;aa[one\&#34;two\&#34;three\&#34;quotes]&#34;=QQQ
print &#34;$aa[one\&#34;two\&#34;three\&#34;quotes]&#34;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is important to note that the quoting rules do not change when a
parameter expansion with a subscript is nested inside another subscript
expression. That is, it is not necessary to use additional backslashes
within the inner subscript expression; they are removed only once, from
the innermost subscript outwards. Parameters are also expanded from the
innermost subscript first, as each expansion is encountered left to
right in the outer expression.</p>
<p>
A further complication arises from a way in which subscript parsing is
<em>not</em> different from double quote parsing. As in true double-quoting,
the sequences `*\**&#39;, and `*\@*&#39; remain as two characters when they
appear in a subscript expression. To use a literal `***&#39; or `*@*&#39; as an
associative array key, the `*e*&#39; flag must be used:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
typeset -A aa
aa[(e)*]=star
print $aa[(e)*]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
A last detail must be considered when reverse subscripting is performed.
Parameters appearing in the subscript expression are first expanded and
then the complete expression is interpreted as a pattern. This has two
effects: first, parameters behave as if <strong>GLOB_SUBST</strong> were on (and it
cannot be turned off); second, backslashes are interpreted twice, once
when parsing the array subscript and again when parsing the pattern. In
a reverse subscript, it&#39;s necessary to use <em>four</em> backslashes to cause a
single backslash to match literally in the pattern. For complex
patterns, it is often easiest to assign the desired pattern to a
parameter and then refer to that parameter in the subscript, because
then the backslashes, brackets, parentheses, etc., are seen only when
the complete expression is converted to a pattern. To match the value of
a parameter literally in a reverse subscript, rather than as a pattern,
use `*${(q)*/name/*}*&#39; (see /zshexpn/(1)) to quote the expanded value.</p>
<p>
Note that the `*k*&#39; and `*K*&#39; flags are reverse subscripting for an
ordinary array, but are <em>not</em> reverse subscripting for an associative
array! (For an associative array, the keys in the array itself are
interpreted as patterns by those flags; the subscript is a plain string
in that case.)</p>
<p>
One final note, not directly related to subscripting: the numeric names
of positional parameters (described below) are parsed specially, so for
example `*$2foo*&#39; is equivalent to `*${2}foo*&#39;. Therefore, to use
subscript syntax to extract a substring from a positional parameter, the
expansion must be surrounded by braces; for example, `*${2[3,5]}*&#39;
evaluates to the third through fifth characters of the second positional
parameter, but `*$2[3,5]*&#39; is the entire second parameter concatenated
with the filename generation pattern `*[3,5]*&#39;.</p>

POSITIONAL PARAMETERS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The positional parameters provide access to the command-line arguments
of a shell function, shell script, or the shell itself; see the section
`Invocation&#39;, and also the section `Functions&#39;. The parameter <em>n</em>, where
<em>n</em> is a number, is the /n/th positional parameter. The parameter `*$0*&#39;
is a special case, see the section `Parameters Set By The Shell&#39;.</p>
<p>
The parameters <strong>*</strong>, <strong>@</strong> and <strong>argv</strong> are arrays containing all the
positional parameters; thus `*$argv[*/n/*]*&#39;, etc., is equivalent to
simply `*$*/n/&#39;. Note that the options <strong>KSH_ARRAYS</strong> or
<strong>KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT</strong> apply to these arrays as well, so with either of
those options set, `*${argv[0]}*&#39; is equivalent to `*$1*&#39; and so on.</p>
<p>
Positional parameters may be changed after the shell or function starts
by using the <strong>set</strong> builtin, by assigning to the <strong>argv</strong> array, or by
direct assignment of the form `/n/*=*/value/&#39; where <em>n</em> is the number of
the positional parameter to be changed. This also creates (with empty
values) any of the positions from 1 to <em>n</em> that do not already have
values. Note that, because the positional parameters form an array, an
array assignment of the form `/n/*=(<strong><em>value</em> …</strong>)*&#39; is allowed, and has
the effect of shifting all the values at positions greater than <em>n</em> by
as many positions as necessary to accommodate the new values.</p>

<h2 id="headline-9">
LOCAL PARAMETERS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Shell function executions delimit scopes for shell parameters.
(Parameters are dynamically scoped.) The <strong>typeset</strong> builtin, and its
alternative forms <strong>declare</strong>, <strong>integer</strong>, <strong>local</strong> and <strong>readonly</strong> (but not
<strong>export</strong>), can be used to declare a parameter as being local to the
innermost scope.</p>
<p>
When a parameter is read or assigned to, the innermost existing
parameter of that name is used. (That is, the local parameter hides any
less-local parameter.) However, assigning to a non-existent parameter,
or declaring a new parameter with <strong>export</strong>, causes it to be created in
the /outer/most scope.</p>
<p>
Local parameters disappear when their scope ends. <strong>unset</strong> can be used to
delete a parameter while it is still in scope; any outer parameter of
the same name remains hidden.</p>
<p>
Special parameters may also be made local; they retain their special
attributes unless either the existing or the newly-created parameter has
the <strong>-h</strong> (hide) attribute. This may have unexpected effects: there is no
default value, so if there is no assignment at the point the variable is
made local, it will be set to an empty value (or zero in the case of
integers). The following:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
typeset PATH=/new/directory:$PATH
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
is valid for temporarily allowing the shell or programmes called from it
to find the programs in <strong>/new/directory</strong> inside a function.</p>
<p>
Note that the restriction in older versions of zsh that local parameters
were never exported has been removed.</p>

The parameters `*!*&#39;, `*#*&#39;, `***&#39;, `*-<strong>&#39;, `</strong>?*&#39;, `*@*&#39;, `*$*&#39;,
`*ARGC*&#39;, `*HISTCMD*&#39;, `*LINENO*&#39;, `*PPID*&#39;, `*status*&#39;, `*TTYIDLE*&#39;,
`*zsh_eval_context*&#39;, `*ZSH_EVAL_CONTEXT*&#39;, and `*ZSH_SUBSHELL*&#39; are
read-only and thus cannot be restored by the user, so they are not

loaded from modules.</p>
<p>
The following parameters are automatically set by the shell:</p>
<p>
<strong>!</strong> &lt;S&gt; The process ID of the last command started in the background
with <strong>&amp;</strong>, put into the background with the <strong>bg</strong> builtin, or spawned with
<strong>coproc</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>#</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The number of positional parameters in decimal. Note that
some confusion may occur with the syntax <strong>$#*/param/ which substitutes
the length of /param/. Use *${#}</strong> to resolve ambiguities. In
particular, the sequence `*$#-<strong><em>…</em>&#39; in an arithmetic expression is
interpreted as the length of the parameter *-</strong>, q.v.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>ARGC</strong> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Same as <strong>#</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>$</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The process ID of this shell, set when the shell
initializes. Processes forked from the shell without executing a new
program, such as command substitutions and commands grouped with
<strong>(*/…/</strong>)*, are subshells that duplicate the current shell, and thus
substitute the same value for <strong>$$</strong> as their parent shell.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Flags supplied to the shell on invocation or by the <strong>set</strong>
or <strong>setopt</strong> commands.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>*</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>An array containing the positional parameters.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>argv</strong> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Same as <strong>*</strong>. Assigning to <strong>argv</strong> changes the local
positional parameters, but <strong>argv</strong> is <em>not</em> itself a local parameter.
Deleting <strong>argv</strong> with <strong>unset</strong> in any function deletes it everywhere,
although only the innermost positional parameter array is deleted (so
<strong>*</strong> and <strong>@</strong> in other scopes are not affected).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>@</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Same as <strong>argv[@]</strong>, even when <strong>argv</strong> is not set.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>?</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The exit status returned by the last command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>0</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The name used to invoke the current shell, or as set by the
<strong>-c</strong> command line option upon invocation. If the <strong>FUNCTION_ARGZERO</strong>
option is set, <strong>$0</strong> is set upon entry to a shell function to the name
of the function, and upon entry to a sourced script to the name of the
script, and reset to its previous value when the function or script
returns.</dd>

</dt>
<dd>An array containing the exit statuses returned
by all commands in the last pipeline.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>_</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The last argument of the previous command. Also, this
parameter is set in the environment of every command executed to the
full pathname of the command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>CPUTYPE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The machine type (microprocessor class or machine model),
as determined at run time.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>EGID</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The effective group ID of the shell process. If you have
sufficient privileges, you may change the effective group ID of the
shell process by assigning to this parameter. Also (assuming
sufficient privileges), you may start a single command with a
different effective group ID by `*(EGID=*/gid/*; command)*&#39;

If this is made local, it is not implicitly set to 0, but may be
explicitly set locally.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>EUID</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The effective user ID of the shell process. If you have
sufficient privileges, you may change the effective user ID of the
shell process by assigning to this parameter. Also (assuming
sufficient privileges), you may start a single command with a
different effective user ID by `*(EUID=*/uid/*; command)*&#39;

If this is made local, it is not implicitly set to 0, but may be
explicitly set locally.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>ERRNO</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The value of <strong>errno</strong> (see /errno/(3)) as set by the
most recently failed system call. This value is system dependent and
is intended for debugging purposes. It is also useful with the
<strong>zsh/system</strong> module which allows the number to be turned into a name
or message.

To use this parameter, it must first be assigned a value (typically 0
(zero)). It is initially unset for scripting compatibility.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>FUNCNEST</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Integer. If greater than or equal to zero, the
maximum nesting depth of shell functions. When it is exceeded, an
error is raised at the point where a function is called. The default
value is determined when the shell is configured, but is
typically 500. Increasing the value increases the danger of a runaway
function recursion causing the shell to crash. Setting a negative
value turns off the check.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>GID</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The real group ID of the shell process. If you have
sufficient privileges, you may change the group ID of the shell
process by assigning to this parameter. Also (assuming sufficient
privileges), you may start a single command under a different group ID
by `*(GID=*/gid/*; command)*&#39;

If this is made local, it is not implicitly set to 0, but may be
explicitly set locally.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HISTCMD</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The current history event number in an interactive shell,
in other words the event number for the command that caused <strong>$HISTCMD</strong>
to be read. If the current history event modifies the history,
<strong>HISTCMD</strong> changes to the new maximum history event number.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HOST</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The current hostname.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LINENO</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The line number of the current line within the current
script, sourced file, or shell function being executed, whichever was
started most recently. Note that in the case of shell functions the
line number refers to the function as it appeared in the original
definition, not necessarily as displayed by the <strong>functions</strong> builtin.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LOGNAME</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If the corresponding variable is not set in the
environment of the shell, it is initialized to the login name
corresponding to the current login session. This parameter is exported
by default but this can be disabled using the <strong>typeset</strong> builtin. The
value is set to the string returned by the /getlogin/(3) system call
if that is available.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MACHTYPE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The machine type (microprocessor class or machine
model), as determined at compile time.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>OLDPWD</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The previous working directory. This is set when the shell
initializes and whenever the directory changes.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>OPTARG</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The value of the last option argument processed by the
<strong>getopts</strong> command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>OPTIND</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The index of the last option argument processed by the
<strong>getopts</strong> command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>OSTYPE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The operating system, as determined at compile time.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PPID</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The process ID of the parent of the shell, set when the
shell initializes. As with <strong>$$</strong>, the value does not change in
subshells created as a duplicate of the current shell.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PWD</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The present working directory. This is set when the shell
initializes and whenever the directory changes.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>RANDOM</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>A pseudo-random integer from 0 to 32767, newly
generated each time this parameter is referenced. The random number
generator can be seeded by assigning a numeric value to <strong>RANDOM</strong>.

The values of <strong>RANDOM</strong> form an intentionally-repeatable pseudo-random
sequence; subshells that reference <strong>RANDOM</strong> will result in identical
pseudo-random values unless the value of <strong>RANDOM</strong> is referenced or
seeded in the parent shell in between subshell invocations.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SECONDS</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The number of seconds since shell invocation. If this
parameter is assigned a value, then the value returned upon reference
will be the value that was assigned plus the number of seconds since
the assignment.

Unlike other special parameters, the type of the <strong>SECONDS</strong> parameter
can be changed using the <strong>typeset</strong> command. The type may be changed
only to one of the floating point types or back to integer. For
example, `*typeset -F SECONDS*&#39; causes the value to be reported as a
floating point number. The value is available to microsecond accuracy,
although the shell may show more or fewer digits depending on the use
of <strong>typeset</strong>. See the documentation for the builtin <strong>typeset</strong> in
/zshbuiltins/(1) for more details.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SHLVL</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Incremented by one each time a new shell is started.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>signals</strong>
</dt>
<dd>An array containing the names of the signals. Note that
with the standard zsh numbering of array indices, where the first
element has index 1, the signals are offset by 1 from the signal
number used by the operating system. For example, on typical Unix-like
systems <strong>HUP</strong> is signal number 1, but is referred to as <strong>$signals[2]</strong>.
This is because of <strong>EXIT</strong> at position 1 in the array, which is used
internally by zsh but is not known to the operating system.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>TRY_BLOCK_ERROR</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>In an <strong>always</strong> block, indicates whether the
preceding list of code caused an error. The value is 1 to indicate an
error, 0 otherwise. It may be reset, clearing the error condition. See
<em>Complex Commands</em> in /zshmisc/(1)</dd>
<dt>
<strong>TRY_BLOCK_INTERRUPT</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>This variable works in a similar way to
<strong>TRY_BLOCK_ERROR</strong>, but represents the status of an interrupt from the
signal SIGINT, which typically comes from the keyboard when the user
types <strong>^C</strong>. If set to 0, any such interrupt will be reset; otherwise,
the interrupt is propagated after the <strong>always</strong> block.

Note that it is possible that an interrupt arrives during the
execution of the <strong>always</strong> block; this interrupt is also propagated.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>TTY</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The name of the tty associated with the shell, if any.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>TTYIDLE</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The idle time of the tty associated with the shell in
seconds or -1 if there is no such tty.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>UID</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The real user ID of the shell process. If you have
sufficient privileges, you may change the user ID of the shell by
assigning to this parameter. Also (assuming sufficient privileges),
you may start a single command under a different user ID by
`*(UID=*/uid/*; command)*&#39;

If this is made local, it is not implicitly set to 0, but may be
explicitly set locally.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>USERNAME</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The username corresponding to the real user ID of
the shell process. If you have sufficient privileges, you may change
the username (and also the user ID and group ID) of the shell by
assigning to this parameter. Also (assuming sufficient privileges),
you may start a single command under a different username (and user ID
and group ID) by `*(USERNAME=*/username/*; command)*&#39;</dd>
<dt>
<strong>VENDOR</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The vendor, as determined at compile time.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>zsh_eval_context</strong> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<strong>ZSH_EVAL_CONTEXT</strong> &lt;S&gt;)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>An array
(colon-separated list) indicating the context of shell code that is
being run. Each time a piece of shell code that is stored within the
shell is executed a string is temporarily appended to the array to
indicate the type of operation that is being performed. Read in order
the array gives an indication of the stack of operations being
performed with the most immediate context last.</p>
<p>
Note that the variable does not give information on syntactic context
such as pipelines or subshells. Use <strong>$ZSH_SUBSHELL</strong> to detect
subshells.</p>

PARAMETERS USED BY THE SHELL
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The following parameters are used by the shell. Again, `&lt;S&gt;&#39; indicates
that the parameter is special and `&lt;Z&gt;&#39; indicates that the parameter
does not exist when the shell initializes in <strong>sh</strong> or <strong>ksh</strong> emulation
mode.</p>
<p>
In cases where there are two parameters with an upper- and lowercase
form of the same name, such as <strong>path</strong> and <strong>PATH</strong>, the lowercase form is
an array and the uppercase form is a scalar with the elements of the
array joined together by colons. These are similar to tied parameters
created via `*typeset -T*&#39;. The normal use for the colon-separated form
is for exporting to the environment, while the array form is easier to
manipulate within the shell. Note that unsetting either of the pair will
unset the other; they retain their special properties when recreated,
and recreating one of the pair will recreate the other.</p>
<p>
<strong>ARGV0</strong> If exported, its value is used as the <strong>argv[0]</strong> of external
commands. Usually used in constructs like `*ARGV0=emacs nethack*&#39;.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>BAUD</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The rate in bits per second at which data reaches the
terminal. The line editor will use this value in order to compensate
for a slow terminal by delaying updates to the display until
necessary. If the parameter is unset or the value is zero the
compensation mechanism is turned off. The parameter is not set by
default.

This parameter may be profitably set in some circumstances, e.g. for
slow modems dialing into a communications server, or on a slow wide
area network. It should be set to the baud rate of the slowest part of
the link for best performance.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>cdpath</strong> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<strong>CDPATH</strong> &lt;S&gt;)
</dt>
<dd>An array (colon-separated list) of
directories specifying the search path for the <strong>cd</strong> command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>COLUMNS</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The number of columns for this terminal session. Used

<strong>CORRECT_IGNORE</strong>

<dd>If set, is treated as a pattern during spelling
correction. Any potential correction that matches the pattern is
ignored. For example, if the value is `*_**&#39; then completion functions
(which, by convention, have names beginning with `*_*&#39;) will never be
offered as spelling corrections. The pattern does not apply to the
correction of file names, as applied by the <strong>CORRECT_ALL</strong> option (so
with the example just given files beginning with `*_*&#39; in the current
directory would still be completed).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>CORRECT_IGNORE_FILE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set, is treated as a pattern during
spelling correction of file names. Any file name that matches the
pattern is never offered as a correction. For example, if the value is
`*.**&#39; then dot file names will never be offered as spelling
corrections. This is useful with the <strong>CORRECT_ALL</strong> option.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>DIRSTACKSIZE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The maximum size of the directory stack, by default
there is no limit. If the stack gets larger than this, it will be
truncated automatically. This is useful with the <strong>AUTO_PUSHD</strong> option.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>ENV</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If the <strong>ENV</strong> environment variable is set when zsh is invoked
as <strong>sh</strong> or <strong>ksh</strong>, <strong>$ENV</strong> is sourced after the profile scripts. The
value of <strong>ENV</strong> is subjected to parameter expansion, command
substitution, and arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a
pathname. Note that <strong>ENV</strong> is <em>not</em> used unless the shell is
interactive and zsh is emulating <strong>sh</strong> or <strong>ksh</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>FCEDIT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The default editor for the <strong>fc</strong> builtin. If <strong>FCEDIT</strong> is
not set, the parameter <strong>EDITOR</strong> is used; if that is not set either, a
builtin default, usually <strong>vi</strong>, is used.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>fignore</strong> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<strong>FIGNORE</strong> &lt;S&gt;)
</dt>
<dd>An array (colon separated list)
containing the suffixes of files to be ignored during filename
completion. However, if completion only generates files with suffixes
in this list, then these files are completed anyway.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>fpath</strong> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<strong>FPATH</strong> &lt;S&gt;)
</dt>
<dd>An array (colon separated list) of
directories specifying the search path for function definitions. This
path is searched when a function with the <strong>-u</strong> attribute is
referenced. If an executable file is found, then it is read and
executed in the current environment.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>histchars</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Three characters used by the shell&#39;s history and
lexical analysis mechanism. The first character signals the start of a
history expansion (default `*!*&#39;). The second character signals the
start of a quick history substitution (default `*^*&#39;). The third
character is the comment character (default `*#*&#39;).

The characters must be in the ASCII character set; any attempt to set
<strong>histchars</strong> to characters with a locale-dependent meaning will be
rejected with an error message.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HISTCHARS</strong> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Same as <strong>histchars</strong>. (Deprecated.)</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HISTFILE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The file to save the history in when an interactive
shell exits. If unset, the history is not saved.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HISTORY_IGNORE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>If set, is treated as a pattern at the time
history files are written. Any potential history entry that matches
the pattern is skipped. For example, if the value is `*fc **&#39; then
commands that invoke the interactive history editor are never written
to the history file.</p>
<p>
Note that <strong>HISTORY_IGNORE</strong> defines a single pattern: to specify
alternatives use the `*(<strong><em>first/*|*/second/*|*</em>…/</strong>)*&#39; syntax.</p>
<p>
Compare the <strong>HIST_NO_STORE</strong> option or the <strong>zshaddhistory</strong> hook, either
of which would prevent such commands from being added to the
interactive history at all. If you wish to use <strong>HISTORY_IGNORE</strong> to
stop history being added in the first place, you can define the
following hook:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zshaddhistory() {
  emulate -L zsh
  ## uncomment if HISTORY_IGNORE
  ## should use EXTENDED_GLOB syntax
  # setopt extendedglob
  [[ $1 != ${~HISTORY_IGNORE} ]]
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HISTSIZE</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of events stored in the internal
history list. If you use the <strong>HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST</strong> option, setting
this value larger than the <strong>SAVEHIST</strong> size will give you the
difference as a cushion for saving duplicated history events.

If this is made local, it is not implicitly set to 0, but may be
explicitly set locally.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HOME</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The default argument for the <strong>cd</strong> command. This is not
set automatically by the shell in <strong>sh</strong>, <strong>ksh</strong> or <strong>csh</strong> emulation, but
it is typically present in the environment anyway, and if it becomes
set it has its usual special behaviour.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>IFS</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Internal field separators (by default space, tab, newline
and NUL), that are used to separate words which result from command or
parameter expansion and words read by the <strong>read</strong> builtin. Any
characters from the set space, tab and newline that appear in the IFS
are called <em>IFS white space</em>. One or more IFS white space characters
or one non-IFS white space character together with any adjacent IFS
white space character delimit a field. If an IFS white space character
appears twice consecutively in the IFS, this character is treated as
if it were not an IFS white space character.

If the parameter is unset, the default is used. Note this has a
different effect from setting the parameter to an empty string.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>KEYBOARD_HACK</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This variable defines a character to be removed
from the end of the command line before interpreting it (interactive
shells only). It is intended to fix the problem with keys placed
annoyingly close to return and replaces the <strong>SUNKEYBOARDHACK</strong> option
which did this for backquotes only. Should the chosen character be one
of singlequote, doublequote or backquote, there must also be an odd
number of them on the command line for the last one to be removed.

For backward compatibility, if the <strong>SUNKEYBOARDHACK</strong> option is
explicitly set, the value of <strong>KEYBOARD_HACK</strong> reverts to backquote. If
the option is explicitly unset, this variable is set to empty.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>KEYTIMEOUT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The time the shell waits, in hundredths of seconds,
for another key to be pressed when reading bound multi-character
sequences.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LANG</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>This variable determines the locale category for any
category not specifically selected via a variable starting with
`*LC_*&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LC_ALL</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>This variable overrides the value of the `*LANG*&#39;
variable and the value of any of the other variables starting with
`*LC_*&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LC_COLLATE</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>This variable determines the locale category for
character collation information within ranges in glob brackets and for
sorting.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LC_CTYPE</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>This variable determines the locale category for
character handling functions. If the <strong>MULTIBYTE</strong> option is in effect
this variable or <strong>LANG</strong> should contain a value that reflects the
character set in use, even if it is a single-byte character set,
unless only the 7-bit subset (ASCII) is used. For example, if the
character set is ISO-8859-1, a suitable value might be
<strong>en_US.iso88591</strong> (certain Linux distributions) or <strong>en_US.ISO8859-1</strong>
(MacOS).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LC_MESSAGES</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>This variable determines the language in which
messages should be written. Note that zsh does not use message
catalogs.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LC_NUMERIC</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>This variable affects the decimal point character
and thousands separator character for the formatted input/output
functions and string conversion functions. Note that zsh ignores this
setting when parsing floating point mathematical expressions.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LC_TIME</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>This variable determines the locale category for date
and time formatting in prompt escape sequences.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LINES</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The number of lines for this terminal session. Used for
printing select lists and for the line editor.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LISTMAX</strong>
</dt>
<dd>In the line editor, the number of matches to list without
asking first. If the value is negative, the list will be shown if it
spans at most as many lines as given by the absolute value. If set to
zero, the shell asks only if the top of the listing would scroll off
the screen.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MAIL</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If this parameter is set and <strong>mailpath</strong> is not set, the
shell looks for mail in the specified file.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MAILCHECK</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The interval in seconds between checks for new mail.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>mailpath</strong> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<strong>MAILPATH</strong> &lt;S&gt;)
</dt>
<dd>An array (colon-separated list)
of filenames to check for new mail. Each filename can be followed by a
`*?*&#39; and a message that will be printed. The message will undergo
parameter expansion, command substitution and arithmetic expansion
with the variable <strong>$_</strong> defined as the name of the file that has
changed. The default message is `*You have new mail*&#39;. If an element
is a directory instead of a file the shell will recursively check
every file in every subdirectory of the element.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>manpath</strong> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<strong>MANPATH</strong> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;)
</dt>
<dd>An array (colon-separated
list) whose value is not used by the shell. The <strong>manpath</strong> array can be
useful, however, since setting it also sets <strong>MANPATH</strong>, and vice versa.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>match</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>mbegin</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>mend</strong> Arrays set by the shell when the <strong>b</strong> globbing flag is used in
pattern matches. See the subsection <em>Globbing flags</em> in the
documentation for <em>Filename Generation</em> in /zshexpn/(1).</p>
<p>
<strong>MATCH</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>MBEGIN</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>MEND</strong> Set by the shell when the <strong>m</strong> globbing flag is used in pattern
matches. See the subsection <em>Globbing flags</em> in the documentation for
<em>Filename Generation</em> in /zshexpn/(1).</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>module_path</strong> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<strong>MODULE_PATH</strong> &lt;S&gt;)
</dt>
<dd>An array (colon-separated
list) of directories that <strong>zmodload</strong> searches for dynamically loadable
modules. This is initialized to a standard pathname, usually
`*/usr/local/lib/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION*&#39;. (The `*/usr/local/lib*&#39; part
varies from installation to installation.) For security reasons, any
value set in the environment when the shell is started will be
ignored.

These parameters only exist if the installation supports dynamic
module loading.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>NULLCMD</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The command name to assume if a redirection is
specified with no command. Defaults to <strong>cat</strong>. For <strong>sh*/*ksh</strong> behavior,
change this to <strong>:</strong>. For <strong>csh</strong>-like behavior, unset this parameter; the
shell will print an error message if null commands are entered.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>path</strong> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<strong>PATH</strong> &lt;S&gt;)
</dt>
<dd>An array (colon-separated list) of
directories to search for commands. When this parameter is set, each
directory is scanned and all files found are put in a hash table.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>POSTEDIT</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>This string is output whenever the line editor
exits. It usually contains termcap strings to reset the terminal.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>PROMPT</strong> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;</p>
<p>
<strong>PROMPT2</strong> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;</p>
<p>
<strong>PROMPT3</strong> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;</p>
<p>
<strong>PROMPT4</strong> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; Same as <strong>PS1</strong>, <strong>PS2</strong>, <strong>PS3</strong> and <strong>PS4</strong>, respectively.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>prompt</strong> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Same as <strong>PS1</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PROMPT_EOL_MARK</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When the <strong>PROMPT_CR</strong> and <strong>PROMPT_SP</strong> options are
set, the <strong>PROMPT_EOL_MARK</strong> parameter can be used to customize how the
end of partial lines are shown. This parameter undergoes prompt
expansion, with the <strong>PROMPT_PERCENT</strong> option set. If not set, the
default behavior is equivalent to the value `*%B%S%#%s%b*&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PS1</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The primary prompt string, printed before a command is
read. It undergoes a special form of expansion before being displayed;
see EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in /zshmisc/(1). The default is
`*%m%# *&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PS2</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The secondary prompt, printed when the shell needs more
information to complete a command. It is expanded in the same way as
<strong>PS1</strong>. The default is `*%_&gt; *&#39;, which displays any shell constructs or
quotation marks which are currently being processed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PS3</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Selection prompt used within a <strong>select</strong> loop. It is
expanded in the same way as <strong>PS1</strong>. The default is `*?# *&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PS4</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The execution trace prompt. Default is `*+%N:%i&gt; *&#39;,
which displays the name of the current shell structure and the line
number within it. In sh or ksh emulation, the default is `*+ *&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>psvar</strong> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<strong>PSVAR</strong> &lt;S&gt;)
</dt>
<dd>An array (colon-separated list) whose
elements can be used in <strong>PROMPT</strong> strings. Setting <strong>psvar</strong> also sets
<strong>PSVAR</strong>, and vice versa.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>READNULLCMD</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The command name to assume if a single input
redirection is specified with no command. Defaults to <strong>more</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>REPORTMEMORY</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If nonnegative, commands whose maximum resident set
size (roughly speaking, main memory usage) in kilobytes is greater
than this value have timing statistics reported. The format used to
output statistics is the value of the <strong>TIMEFMT</strong> parameter, which is
the same as for the <strong>REPORTTIME</strong> variable and the <strong>time</strong> builtin; note
that by default this does not output memory usage. Appending <strong>&#34; max
RSS %M&#34;</strong> to the value of <strong>TIMEFMT</strong> causes it to output the value that
triggered the report. If <strong>REPORTTIME</strong> is also in use, at most a single
report is printed for both triggers. This feature requires the
<strong>getrusage()</strong> system call, commonly supported by modern Unix-like
systems.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>REPORTTIME</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If nonnegative, commands whose combined user and
system execution times (measured in seconds) are greater than this
value have timing statistics printed for them. Output is suppressed
for commands executed within the line editor, including completion;
commands explicitly marked with the <strong>time</strong> keyword still cause the
summary to be printed in this case.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>REPLY</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This parameter is reserved by convention to pass string
values between shell scripts and shell builtins in situations where a
function call or redirection are impossible or undesirable. The <strong>read</strong>
builtin and the <strong>select</strong> complex command may set <strong>REPLY</strong>, and filename
generation both sets and examines its value when evaluating certain
expressions. Some modules also employ <strong>REPLY</strong> for similar purposes.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>reply</strong>
</dt>
<dd>As <strong>REPLY</strong>, but for array values rather than strings.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>RPROMPT</strong> &lt;S&gt;</p>
<p>
<strong>RPS1</strong> &lt;S&gt; This prompt is displayed on the right-hand side of the screen
when the primary prompt is being displayed on the left. This does not
work if the <strong>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</strong> option is set. It is expanded in the same
way as <strong>PS1</strong>.</p>
<p>
<strong>RPROMPT2</strong> &lt;S&gt;</p>
<p>
<strong>RPS2</strong> &lt;S&gt; This prompt is displayed on the right-hand side of the screen
when the secondary prompt is being displayed on the left. This does not
work if the <strong>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</strong> option is set. It is expanded in the same
way as <strong>PS2</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>SAVEHIST</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of history events to save in the
history file.

If this is made local, it is not implicitly set to 0, but may be
explicitly set locally.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SPROMPT</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The prompt used for spelling correction. The sequence
`*%R*&#39; expands to the string which presumably needs spelling
correction, and `*%r*&#39; expands to the proposed correction. All other
prompt escapes are also allowed.</p>
<p>
The actions available at the prompt are <strong>[nyae]</strong>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>n</strong> (`no&#39;) (default)
</dt>
<dd>Discard the correction and run the command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>y</strong> (`yes&#39;)
</dt>
<dd>Make the correction and run the command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>a</strong> (`abort&#39;)
</dt>
<dd>Discard the entire command line without running it.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>e</strong> (`edit&#39;)
</dt>
<dd>Resume editing the command line.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>STTY</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If this parameter is set in a command&#39;s environment, the
shell runs the <strong>stty</strong> command with the value of this parameter as
arguments in order to set up the terminal before executing the
command. The modes apply only to the command, and are reset when it
finishes or is suspended. If the command is suspended and continued
later with the <strong>fg</strong> or <strong>wait</strong> builtins it will see the modes specified
by <strong>STTY</strong>, as if it were not suspended. This (intentionally) does not
apply if the command is continued via `*kill* -CONT&#39;. <strong>STTY</strong> is
ignored if the command is run in the background, or if it is in the
environment of the shell but not explicitly assigned to in the input
line. This avoids running stty at every external command by
accidentally exporting it. Also note that <strong>STTY</strong> should not be used
for window size specifications; these will not be local to the
command.

If the parameter is set and empty, all of the above applies except
that <strong>stty</strong> is not run. This can be useful as a way to freeze the tty
around a single command, blocking its changes to tty settings, similar
to the <strong>ttyctl</strong> builtin.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>TERM</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>The type of terminal in use. This is used when looking
up termcap sequences. An assignment to <strong>TERM</strong> causes zsh to
re-initialize the terminal, even if the value does not change (e.g.,
`*TERM=$TERM*&#39;). It is necessary to make such an assignment upon any
change to the terminal definition database or terminal type in order
for the new settings to take effect.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>TERMINFO</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>A reference to your terminfo database, used by the
`terminfo&#39; library when the system has it; see /terminfo/(5). If set,
this causes the shell to reinitialise the terminal, making the
workaround `*TERM=$TERM*&#39; unnecessary.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>TERMINFO_DIRS</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>A colon-seprarated list of terminfo databases,
used by the `terminfo&#39; library when the system has it; see
/terminfo/(5). This variable is only used by certain terminal
libraries, in particular ncurses; see /terminfo/(5) to check support
on your system. If set, this causes the shell to reinitialise the
terminal, making the workaround `*TERM=$TERM*&#39; unnecessary. Note that
unlike other colon-separated arrays this is not tied to a zsh array.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>TIMEFMT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The format of process time reports with the <strong>time</strong>
keyword. The default is `*%J %U user %S system %P cpu %*E total*&#39;.
Recognizes the following escape sequences, although not all may be
available on all systems, and some that are available may not be
useful:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>%%</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A `*%*&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%U</strong>
</dt>
<dd>CPU seconds spent in user mode.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%S</strong>
</dt>
<dd>CPU seconds spent in kernel mode.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%E</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Elapsed time in seconds.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%P</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The CPU percentage, computed as 100*(<strong>%U*+*%S</strong>)/*%E*.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%W</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Number of times the process was swapped.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%X</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The average amount in (shared) text space used in kilobytes.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%D</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The average amount in (unshared) data/stack space used in
kilobytes.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%K</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The total space used (<strong>%X*+*%D</strong>) in kilobytes.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%M</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The maximum memory the process had in use at any time in
kilobytes.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%F</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The number of major page faults (page needed to be brought
from disk).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%R</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The number of minor page faults.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%I</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The number of input operations.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%O</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The number of output operations.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%r</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The number of socket messages received.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%s</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The number of socket messages sent.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%k</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The number of signals received.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%w</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Number of voluntary context switches (waits).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%c</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Number of involuntary context switches.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>%J</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The name of this job.</dd>
</dl>
<p>A star may be inserted between the percent sign and flags printing
time (e.g., `*%*E*&#39;); this causes the time to be printed in
`/hh/*:*/mm/*:*/ss/*.*/ttt/&#39; format (hours and minutes are only
printed if they are not zero). Alternatively, `*m*&#39; or `*u*&#39; may be
used (e.g., `*%mE*&#39;) to produce time output in milliseconds or
microseconds, respectively.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>TMOUT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If this parameter is nonzero, the shell will receive an
<strong>ALRM</strong> signal if a command is not entered within the specified number
of seconds after issuing a prompt. If there is a trap on <strong>SIGALRM</strong>, it
will be executed and a new alarm is scheduled using the value of the
<strong>TMOUT</strong> parameter after executing the trap. If no trap is set, and the
idle time of the terminal is not less than the value of the <strong>TMOUT</strong>
parameter, zsh terminates. Otherwise a new alarm is scheduled to
<strong>TMOUT</strong> seconds after the last keypress.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>TMPPREFIX</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A pathname prefix which the shell will use for all
temporary files. Note that this should include an initial part for the
file name as well as any directory names. The default is `*/tmp/zsh*&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>TMPSUFFIX</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A filename suffix which the shell will use for
temporary files created by process substitutions (e.g.,
`*=(<strong><em>list</em></strong>)*/&#39;)./ Note that the value should include a leading dot
`*.*/&#39; if intended/ to be interpreted as a file extension. The default
is not to append any suffix, thus this parameter should be assigned
only when needed and then unset again.</dd>
<dt>
*WORDCHARS*/ &lt;S&gt;/
</dt>
<dd>A list of non-alphanumeric characters considered
part of a word by the line editor.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>ZBEEP</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set, this gives a string of characters, which can use
all the same codes as the *bindkey*/ command as described in/ the
zsh/zle module entry in <em>zshmodules(1), that will be output to the
terminal</em> instead of beeping. This may have a visible instead of an
audible effect; for example, the string `*\e[?5h\e[?5l*/&#39; on a vt100
or xterm will have/ the effect of flashing reverse video on and off
(if you usually use reverse video, you should use the string
`*\e[?5l\e[?5h*/&#39; instead). This takes/ precedence over the *NOBEEP*/
option./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>ZDOTDIR</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The directory to search for shell startup files (.zshrc,
etc), if not *$HOME*/./</dd>
<dt>
<strong>zle_bracketed_paste</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Many terminal emulators have a feature that
allows applications to identify when text is pasted into the terminal
rather than being typed normally. For ZLE, this means that special
characters such as tabs and newlines can be inserted instead of
invoking editor commands. Furthermore, pasted text forms a single undo
event and if the region is active, pasted text will replace the
region.

This two-element array contains the terminal escape sequences for
enabling and disabling the feature. These escape sequences are used to
enable bracketed paste when ZLE is active and disable it at other
times. Unsetting the parameter has the effect of ensuring that
bracketed paste remains disabled.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>zle_highlight</strong>
</dt>
<dd>An array describing contexts in which ZLE should
highlight the input text. See <em>Character Highlighting in zshzle(1).</em></dd>
<dt>
<strong>ZLE_LINE_ABORTED</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This parameter is set by the line editor when an
error occurs. It contains the line that was being edited at the point
of the error. `*print -zr – $ZLE_LINE_ABORTED*/&#39; can be used to
recover the line./ Only the most recent line of this kind is
remembered.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS</strong> These parameters are used by the line editor.
In certain circumstances suffixes (typically space or slash) added by
the completion system will be removed automatically, either because the
next editing command was not an insertable character, or because the
character was marked as requiring the suffix to be removed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These variables can contain the sets of characters that will cause the
suffix to be removed. If *ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS*/ is set, those/
characters will cause the suffix to be removed; if
*ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS*/ is set, those characters will cause the/
suffix to be removed and replaced by a space.</p>
<p>
If *ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS*/ is not set, the default behaviour is/
equivalent to:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS=$&#39; \t\n;&amp;|&#39;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If *ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS*/ is set but is empty, no characters have
this/ behaviour. *ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS*/ takes precedence, so that
the/ following:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS=$&#39;&amp;|&#39;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
causes the characters `*&amp;*/&#39; and `/*|*/&#39; to remove the suffix but to/
replace it with a space.</p>
<p>
To illustrate the difference, suppose that the option
<strong>AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH</strong> is in effect and the directory *DIR*/ has just been
completed, with an/ appended */*/, following which the user types
`/*&amp;*/&#39;. The default result/ is `*DIR&amp;*/&#39;. With
<em><strong>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS</strong></em> set but without including/ `*&amp;*/&#39; the result
is `/*DIR/&amp;*/&#39;. With <em><strong>ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS</strong></em> set to/ include `*&amp;*/&#39;
the result is `/*DIR &amp;*/&#39;./</p>
<p>
Note that certain completions may provide their own suffix removal or
replacement behaviour which overrides the values described here. See the
completion system documentation in <em>zshcompsys(1).</em></p>

<dl>
<dt>
*ZLE_RPROMPT_INDENT*/ &lt;S&gt;/
</dt>
<dd>If set, used to give the indentation
between the right hand side of the right prompt in the line editor as
given by <strong>RPS1*/ or /*RPROMPT</strong> and the right hand side of the screen.
If not set, the value 1 is used.

Typically this will be used to set the value to 0 so that the prompt
appears flush with the right hand side of the screen. This is not the
default as many terminals do not handle this correctly, in particular
when the prompt appears at the extreme bottom right of the screen.
Recent virtual terminals are more likely to handle this case
correctly. Some experimentation is necessary.</dd>
