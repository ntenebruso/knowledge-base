SPECIFYING OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Options are primarily referred to by name. These names are case
insensitive and underscores are ignored. For example, `*allexport*&#39; is
equivalent to `*A__lleXP_ort*&#39;.</p>
<p>
The sense of an option name may be inverted by preceding it with `*no*&#39;,
so `*setopt No_Beep*&#39; is equivalent to `*unsetopt beep*&#39;. This inversion
can only be done once, so `*nonobeep*&#39; is <em>not</em> a synonym for `*beep*&#39;.
Similarly, `*tify*&#39; is not a synonym for `*nonotify*&#39; (the inversion of
`*notify*&#39;).</p>
<p>
Some options also have one or more single letter names. There are two
sets of single letter options: one used by default, and another used to
emulate <strong>sh*/*ksh</strong> (used when the <strong>SH_OPTION_LETTERS</strong> option is set).
The single letter options can be used on the shell command line, or with
the <strong>set</strong>, <strong>setopt</strong> and <strong>unsetopt</strong> builtins, as normal Unix options
preceded by `*-*&#39;.</p>
<p>
The sense of the single letter options may be inverted by using `*+*&#39;
instead of `*-*&#39;. Some of the single letter option names refer to an
option being off, in which case the inversion of that name refers to the
option being on. For example, `*+n*&#39; is the short name of `*exec*&#39;, and
`*-n*&#39; is the short name of its inversion, `*noexec*&#39;.</p>
<p>
In strings of single letter options supplied to the shell at startup,
trailing whitespace will be ignored; for example the string `*-f <strong>&#39; will
be treated just as `</strong>-f*&#39;, but the string `*-f i*&#39; is an error. This is
because many systems which implement the `*#!*&#39; mechanism for calling
scripts do not strip trailing whitespace.</p>
<p>
It is possible for options to be set within a function scope. See the
description of the option <strong>LOCAL_OPTIONS</strong> below.</p>

DESCRIPTION OF OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>In the following list, options set by default in all emulations are
marked &lt;D&gt;; those set by default only in csh, ksh, sh, or zsh emulations
are marked &lt;C&gt;, &lt;K&gt;, &lt;S&gt;, &lt;Z&gt; as appropriate. When listing options (by
`*setopt*&#39;, `*unsetopt*&#39;, `*set -o*&#39; or `*set +o*&#39;), those turned on by
default appear in the list prefixed with `*no*&#39;. Hence (unless
<strong>KSH_OPTION_PRINT</strong> is set), `*setopt*&#39; shows all options whose settings
are changed from the default.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-3">

Changing Directories
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p><strong>AUTO_CD</strong> (<strong>-J</strong>) If a command is issued that can&#39;t be executed as a
normal command, and the command is the name of a directory, perform the
<strong>cd</strong> command to that directory. This option is only applicable if the
option <strong>SHIN_STDIN</strong> is set, i.e. if commands are being read from
standard input. The option is designed for interactive use; it is
recommended that <strong>cd</strong> be used explicitly in scripts to avoid ambiguity.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>AUTO_PUSHD</strong> (<strong>-N</strong>)
</dt>
<dd>Make <strong>cd</strong> push the old directory onto the
directory stack.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>CDABLE_VARS</strong> (<strong>-T</strong>)
</dt>
<dd>If the argument to a <strong>cd</strong> command (or an
implied <strong>cd</strong> with the <strong>AUTO_CD</strong> option set) is not a directory, and
does not begin with a slash, try to expand the expression as if it
were preceded by a `*~*&#39; (see the section `Filename Expansion&#39;).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>CD_SILENT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Never print the working directory after a <strong>cd</strong> (whether
explicit or implied with the <strong>AUTO_CD</strong> option set). <strong>cd</strong> normally
prints the working directory when the argument given to it was <strong>-</strong>, a
stack entry, or the name of a directory found under <strong>CDPATH</strong>. Note
that this is distinct from <strong>pushd</strong>&#39;s stack-printing behaviour, which
is controlled by <strong>PUSHD_SILENT</strong>. This option overrides the
printing-related effects of <strong>POSIX_CD</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>CHASE_DOTS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When changing to a directory containing a path segment
`*..*&#39; which would otherwise be treated as canceling the previous
segment in the path (in other words, `*foo/..*&#39; would be removed from
the path, or if `*..*&#39; is the first part of the path, the last part of
the current working directory would be removed), instead resolve the
path to the physical directory. This option is overridden by
<strong>CHASE_LINKS</strong>.

For example, suppose <strong>/foo/bar</strong> is a link to the directory <strong>/alt/rod</strong>.
Without this option set, `*cd <em>foo/bar</em>..*&#39; changes to <strong>/foo</strong>; with it
set, it changes to <strong>/alt</strong>. The same applies if the current directory
is <strong>/foo/bar</strong> and `*cd ..*&#39; is used. Note that all other symbolic
links in the path will also be resolved.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>CHASE_LINKS</strong> (<strong>-w</strong>)
</dt>
<dd>Resolve symbolic links to their true values
when changing directory. This also has the effect of <strong>CHASE_DOTS</strong>,
i.e. a `*..*&#39; path segment will be treated as referring to the
physical parent, even if the preceding path segment is a symbolic
link.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>POSIX_CD</strong> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Modifies the behaviour of <strong>cd</strong>, <strong>chdir</strong> and
<strong>pushd</strong> commands to make them more compatible with the POSIX standard.
The behaviour with the option unset is described in the documentation
for the <strong>cd</strong> builtin in /zshbuiltins/(1). If the option is set, the
shell does not test for directories beneath the local directory
(`*.*&#39;) until after all directories in <strong>cdpath</strong> have been tested, and
the <strong>cd</strong> and <strong>chdir</strong> commands do not recognise arguments of the form
`{<strong>+*|</strong>-*}/n/&#39; as directory stack entries.

Also, if the option is set, the conditions under which the shell
prints the new directory after changing to it are modified. It is no
longer restricted to interactive shells (although printing of the
directory stack with <strong>pushd</strong> is still limited to interactive shells);
and any use of a component of <strong>CDPATH</strong>, including a `*.*&#39; but
excluding an empty component that is otherwise treated as `*.*&#39;,
causes the directory to be printed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t push multiple copies of the same
directory onto the directory stack.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PUSHD_MINUS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Exchanges the meanings of `*+*&#39; and `*-*&#39; when used
with a number to specify a directory in the stack.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PUSHD_SILENT</strong> (<strong>-E</strong>)
</dt>
<dd>Do not print the directory stack after
<strong>pushd</strong> or <strong>popd</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PUSHD_TO_HOME</strong> (<strong>-D</strong>)
</dt>
<dd>Have <strong>pushd</strong> with no arguments act like
`*pushd $HOME*&#39;.</dd>

Completion
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p><strong>ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT</strong> &lt;D&gt; If unset, key functions that list completions
try to return to the last prompt if given a numeric argument. If set
these functions try to return to the last prompt if given <em>no</em> numeric
argument.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>ALWAYS_TO_END</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If a completion is performed with the cursor within
a word, and a full completion is inserted, the cursor is moved to the
end of the word. That is, the cursor is moved to the end of the word
if either a single match is inserted or menu completion is performed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>AUTO_LIST</strong> (<strong>-9</strong>) &lt;D&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Automatically list choices on an ambiguous
completion.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>AUTO_MENU</strong> &lt;D&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Automatically use menu completion after the second
consecutive request for completion, for example by pressing the tab
key repeatedly. This option is overridden by <strong>MENU_COMPLETE</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>AUTO_NAME_DIRS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Any parameter that is set to the absolute name of
a directory immediately becomes a name for that directory, that will
be used by the `*%~*&#39; and related prompt sequences, and will be
available when completion is performed on a word starting with `*~*&#39;.
(Otherwise, the parameter must be used in the form `*~*/param/&#39;
first.)</dd>
<dt>
<strong>AUTO_PARAM_KEYS</strong> &lt;D&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If a parameter name was completed and a
following character (normally a space) automatically inserted, and the
next character typed is one of those that have to come directly after
the name (like `*}*&#39;, `*:*&#39;, etc.), the automatically added character
is deleted, so that the character typed comes immediately after the
parameter name. Completion in a brace expansion is affected similarly:
the added character is a `*,*&#39;, which will be removed if `*}*&#39; is
typed next.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>AUTO_PARAM_SLASH</strong> &lt;D&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If a parameter is completed whose content is
the name of a directory, then add a trailing slash instead of a space.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH</strong> &lt;D&gt;
</dt>
<dd>When the last character resulting from a
completion is a slash and the next character typed is a word
delimiter, a slash, or a character that ends a command (such as a
semicolon or an ampersand), remove the slash.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>BASH_AUTO_LIST</strong>
</dt>
<dd>On an ambiguous completion, automatically list
choices when the completion function is called twice in succession.
This takes precedence over <strong>AUTO_LIST</strong>. The setting of
<strong>LIST_AMBIGUOUS</strong> is respected. If <strong>AUTO_MENU</strong> is set, the menu
behaviour will then start with the third press. Note that this will
not work with <strong>MENU_COMPLETE</strong>, since repeated completion calls
immediately cycle through the list in that case.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>COMPLETE_ALIASES</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Prevents aliases on the command line from being
internally substituted before completion is attempted. The effect is
to make the alias a distinct command for completion purposes.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If unset, the cursor is set to the end of the
word if completion is started. Otherwise it stays there and completion
is done from both ends.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>GLOB_COMPLETE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When the current word has a glob pattern, do not
insert all the words resulting from the expansion but generate matches
as for completion and cycle through them like <strong>MENU_COMPLETE</strong>. The
matches are generated as if a `***&#39; was added to the end of the word,
or inserted at the cursor when <strong>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</strong> is set. This
actually uses pattern matching, not globbing, so it works not only for
files but for any completion, such as options, user names, etc.

Note that when the pattern matcher is used, matching control (for
example, case-insensitive or anchored matching) cannot be used. This
limitation only applies when the current word contains a pattern;
simply turning on the <strong>GLOB_COMPLETE</strong> option does not have this
effect.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HASH_LIST_ALL</strong> &lt;D&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Whenever a command completion or spelling
correction is attempted, make sure the entire command path is hashed
first. This makes the first completion slower but avoids false reports
of spelling errors.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LIST_AMBIGUOUS</strong> &lt;D&gt;
</dt>
<dd>This option works when <strong>AUTO_LIST</strong> or
<strong>BASH_AUTO_LIST</strong> is also set. If there is an unambiguous prefix to
insert on the command line, that is done without a completion list
being displayed; in other words, auto-listing behaviour only takes
place when nothing would be inserted. In the case of <strong>BASH_AUTO_LIST</strong>,
this means that the list will be delayed to the third call of the
function.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LIST_BEEP</strong> &lt;D&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Beep on an ambiguous completion. More accurately,
this forces the completion widgets to return status 1 on an ambiguous
completion, which causes the shell to beep if the option <strong>BEEP</strong> is
also set; this may be modified if completion is called from a
user-defined widget.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LIST_PACKED</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Try to make the completion list smaller (occupying
less lines) by printing the matches in columns with different widths.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LIST_ROWS_FIRST</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Lay out the matches in completion lists sorted
horizontally, that is, the second match is to the right of the first
one, not under it as usual.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LIST_TYPES</strong> (<strong>-X</strong>) &lt;D&gt;
</dt>
<dd>When listing files that are possible
completions, show the type of each file with a trailing identifying
mark.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MENU_COMPLETE</strong> (<strong>-Y</strong>)
</dt>
<dd>On an ambiguous completion, instead of
listing possibilities or beeping, insert the first match immediately.
Then when completion is requested again, remove the first match and
insert the second match, etc. When there are no more matches, go back
to the first one again. <strong>reverse-menu-complete</strong> may be used to loop
through the list in the other direction. This option overrides
<strong>AUTO_MENU</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>REC_EXACT</strong> (<strong>-S</strong>)
</dt>
<dd>If the string on the command line exactly
matches one of the possible completions, it is accepted, even if there
is another completion (i.e. that string with something else added)
that also matches.</dd>

Expansion and Globbing
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p><strong>BAD_PATTERN</strong> (<strong>+2</strong>) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt; If a pattern for filename generation is
badly formed, print an error message. (If this option is unset, the
pattern will be left unchanged.)</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>BARE_GLOB_QUAL</strong> &lt;Z&gt;
</dt>
<dd>In a glob pattern, treat a trailing set of
parentheses as a qualifier list, if it contains no `*|*&#39;, `*(<strong>&#39; or (if
special) `*~</strong>&#39; characters. See the section `Filename Generation&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>BRACE_CCL</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Expand expressions in braces which would not otherwise
undergo brace expansion to a lexically ordered list of all the
characters. See the section `Brace Expansion&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>CASE_GLOB</strong> &lt;D&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Make globbing (filename generation) sensitive to
case. Note that other uses of patterns are always sensitive to case.
If the option is unset, the presence of any character which is special
to filename generation will cause case-insensitive matching. For
example, <strong>cvs(/)</strong> can match the directory <strong>CVS</strong> owing to the presence
of the globbing flag (unless the option <strong>BARE_GLOB_QUAL</strong> is unset).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>CASE_MATCH</strong> &lt;D&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Make regular expressions using the <strong>zsh/regex</strong>
module (including matches with <strong>=~</strong>) sensitive to case.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>CASE_PATHS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If <strong>CASE_PATHS</strong> is not set (the default), <strong>CASE_GLOB</strong>
affects the interpretation of <em>every</em> path component, whenever a
special character appears in <em>any</em> component. When <strong>CASE_PATHS</strong> is
set, file path components that do <em>not</em> contain special filename
generation characters are always sensitive to case, thus restricting
<strong>NO_CASE_GLOB</strong> to components that contain globbing characters.

Note that if the filesystem itself is not sensitive to case, then
<strong>CASE_PATHS</strong> has no effect.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>CSH_NULL_GLOB</strong> &lt;C&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If a pattern for filename generation has no
matches, delete the pattern from the argument list; do not report an
error unless all the patterns in a command have no matches. Overrides
<strong>NOMATCH</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>EQUALS</strong> &lt;Z&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Perform <strong>=</strong> filename expansion. (See the section
`Filename Expansion&#39;.)</dd>
<dt>
<strong>EXTENDED_GLOB</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Treat the `*#*&#39;, `*~*&#39; and `*^*&#39; characters as part
of patterns for filename generation, etc. (An initial unquoted `*~*&#39;
always produces named directory expansion.)</dd>
<dt>
<strong>FORCE_FLOAT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Constants in arithmetic evaluation will be treated as
floating point even without the use of a decimal point; the values of
integer variables will be converted to floating point when used in
arithmetic expressions. Integers in any base will be converted.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>GLOB</strong> (<strong>+F</strong>, ksh: <strong>+f</strong>) &lt;D&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Perform filename generation
(globbing). (See the section `Filename Generation&#39;.)</dd>
<dt>
<strong>GLOB_ASSIGN</strong> &lt;C&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If this option is set, filename generation
(globbing) is performed on the right hand side of scalar parameter
assignments of the form `/name/*=*/pattern/ (e.g. `*foo=**&#39;). If the
result has more than one word the parameter will become an array with
those words as arguments. This option is provided for backwards
compatibility only: globbing is always performed on the right hand
side of array assignments of the form `/name/*=(<strong><em>value</em></strong>)*&#39; (e.g.
`*foo=(<strong>)</strong>&#39;) and this form is recommended for clarity; with this
option set, it is not possible to predict whether the result will be
an array or a scalar.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>GLOB_DOTS</strong> (<strong>-4</strong>)
</dt>
<dd>Do not require a leading `*.*&#39; in a filename to
be matched explicitly.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>GLOB_STAR_SHORT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When this option is set and the default zsh-style
globbing is in effect, the pattern `***/**&#39; can be abbreviated to
`****&#39; and the pattern `****/**&#39; can be abbreviated to <strong><strong>*</strong></strong>. Hence
`***.c*&#39; finds a file ending in <strong>.c</strong> in any subdirectory, and
`****.c*&#39; does the same while also following symbolic links. A <strong>/</strong>
immediately after the `****&#39; or `*****&#39; forces the pattern to be
treated as the unabbreviated form.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>GLOB_SUBST</strong> &lt;C&gt; &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Treat any characters resulting from
parameter expansion as being eligible for filename expansion and
filename generation, and any characters resulting from command
substitution as being eligible for filename generation. Braces (and
commas in between) do not become eligible for expansion.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HIST_SUBST_PATTERN</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Substitutions using the <strong>:s</strong> and <strong>:&amp;</strong> history
modifiers are performed with pattern matching instead of string
matching. This occurs wherever history modifiers are valid, including
glob qualifiers and parameters. See the section `Modifiers&#39; in
/zshexpn/(1).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>IGNORE_BRACES</strong> (<strong>-I</strong>) &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Do not perform brace expansion. For
historical reasons this also includes the effect of the
<strong>IGNORE_CLOSE_BRACES</strong> option.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>IGNORE_CLOSE_BRACES</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>When neither this option nor <strong>IGNORE_BRACES</strong>
is set, a sole close brace character `*}*&#39; is syntactically
significant at any point on a command line. This has the effect that
no semicolon or newline is necessary before the brace terminating a
function or current shell construct. When either option is set, a
closing brace is syntactically significant only in command position.
Unlike <strong>IGNORE_BRACES</strong>, this option does not disable brace expansion.</p>
<p>
For example, with both options unset a function may be defined in the
following fashion:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
args() { echo $# }
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
while if either option is set, this does not work and something
equivalent to the following is required:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
args() { echo $#; }
</pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>KSH_GLOB</strong> &lt;K&gt;
</dt>
<dd>In pattern matching, the interpretation of
parentheses is affected by a preceding `*@*&#39;, `***&#39;, `*+*&#39;, `*?*&#39; or
`*!*&#39;. See the section `Filename Generation&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST</strong>
</dt>
<dd>All unquoted arguments of the form
`/anything/*=*/expression/&#39; appearing after the command name have
filename expansion (that is, where <em>expression</em> has a leading `*~*&#39; or
`*=*&#39;) performed on <em>expression</em> as if it were a parameter assignment.
The argument is not otherwise treated specially; it is passed to the
command as a single argument, and not used as an actual parameter
assignment. For example, in <strong>echo foo=~/bar:~/rod</strong>, both occurrences
of <strong>~</strong> would be replaced. Note that this happens anyway with <strong>typeset</strong>
and similar statements.

This option respects the setting of the <strong>KSH_TYPESET</strong> option. In other
words, if both options are in effect, arguments looking like
assignments will not undergo word splitting.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MARK_DIRS</strong> (<strong>-8</strong>, ksh: <strong>-X</strong>)
</dt>
<dd>Append a trailing `*/*&#39; to all
directory names resulting from filename generation (globbing).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MULTIBYTE</strong> &lt;D&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Respect multibyte characters when found in strings.
When this option is set, strings are examined using the system library
to determine how many bytes form a character, depending on the current
locale. This affects the way characters are counted in pattern
matching, parameter values and various delimiters.

The option is on by default if the shell was compiled with
<strong>MULTIBYTE_SUPPORT</strong>; otherwise it is off by default and has no effect
if turned on.

If the option is off a single byte is always treated as a single
character. This setting is designed purely for examining strings known
to contain raw bytes or other values that may not be characters in the
current locale. It is not necessary to unset the option merely because
the character set for the current locale does not contain multibyte
characters.

The option does not affect the shell&#39;s editor, which always uses the
locale to determine multibyte characters. This is because the
character set displayed by the terminal emulator is independent of
shell settings.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>NOMATCH</strong> (<strong>+3</strong>) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If a pattern for filename generation has
no matches, print an error, instead of leaving it unchanged in the
argument list. This also applies to file expansion of an initial `*~*&#39;
or `*=*&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>NULL_GLOB</strong> (<strong>-G</strong>)
</dt>
<dd>If a pattern for filename generation has no
matches, delete the pattern from the argument list instead of
reporting an error. Overrides <strong>NOMATCH</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>NUMERIC_GLOB_SORT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If numeric filenames are matched by a filename
generation pattern, sort the filenames numerically rather than
lexicographically.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>RC_EXPAND_PARAM</strong> (<strong>-P</strong>)
</dt>
<dd>Array expansions of the form
`/foo/*${<strong><em>xx</em></strong>}*/bar/&#39;, where the parameter <em>xx</em> is set to <strong>(*/a b
c/</strong>)*, are substituted with `/fooabar foobbar foocbar/&#39; instead of the
default `/fooa b cbar/&#39;. Note that an empty array will therefore cause
all arguments to be removed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>REMATCH_PCRE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set, regular expression matching with the <strong>=~</strong>
operator will use Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions from the PCRE
library. (The <strong>zsh/pcre</strong> module must be available.) If not set,
regular expressions will use the extended regexp syntax provided by
the system libraries.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SH_GLOB</strong> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Disables the special meaning of `*(<strong>&#39;, `*|</strong>&#39;,
`*)*&#39; and &#39;<strong>&lt;</strong>&#39; for globbing the result of parameter and command
substitutions, and in some other places where the shell accepts
patterns. If <strong>SH_GLOB</strong> is set but <strong>KSH_GLOB</strong> is not, the shell allows
the interpretation of subshell expressions enclosed in parentheses in
some cases where there is no space before the opening parenthesis,
e.g. <strong>!(true)</strong> is interpreted as if there were a space after the <strong>!</strong>.

<strong>UNSET</strong> (<strong>+u</strong>, ksh: <strong>+u</strong>) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Treat unset parameters as if
they were empty when substituting, and as if they were zero when
reading their values in arithmetic expansion and arithmetic commands.
Otherwise they are treated as an error.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>WARN_CREATE_GLOBAL</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print a warning message when a global
parameter is created in a function by an assignment or in math
context. This often indicates that a parameter has not been declared
local when it should have been. Parameters explicitly declared global
from within a function using <strong>typeset -g</strong> do not cause a warning. Note
that there is no warning when a local parameter is assigned to in a
nested function, which may also indicate an error.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>WARN_NESTED_VAR</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Print a warning message when an existing
parameter from an enclosing function scope, or global, is set in a
function by an assignment or in math context. Assignment to shell
special parameters does not cause a warning. This is the companion to
<strong>WARN_CREATE_GLOBAL</strong> as in this case the warning is only printed when
a parameter is <em>not</em> created. Where possible, use of <strong>typeset -g</strong> to
set the parameter suppresses the error, but note that this needs to be
used every time the parameter is set. To restrict the effect of this
option to a single function scope, use `*functions -W*&#39;.</p>
<p>
For example, the following code produces a warning for the assignment
inside the function <strong>nested</strong> as that overrides the value within
<strong>toplevel</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
toplevel() {
  local foo=&#34;in fn&#34;
  nested
}
nested() {
     foo=&#34;in nested&#34;
}
setopt warn_nested_var
toplevel

<p><strong>APPEND_HISTORY</strong> &lt;D&gt; If this is set, zsh sessions will append their
history list to the history file, rather than replace it. Thus, multiple
parallel zsh sessions will all have the new entries from their history
lists added to the history file, in the order that they exit. The file
will still be periodically re-written to trim it when the number of
lines grows 20% beyond the value specified by <strong>$SAVEHIST</strong> (see also the
<strong>HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY</strong> option).</p>

<strong>BANG_HIST</strong> (<strong>+K</strong>) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;

<dd>Perform textual history expansion,
<strong>csh</strong>-style, treating the character `*!*&#39; specially.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>EXTENDED_HISTORY</strong> &lt;C&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Save each command&#39;s beginning timestamp (in
seconds since the epoch) and the duration (in seconds) to the history
file. The format of this prefixed data is:

`*: <strong><em>&lt;beginning time&gt;</em></strong>:*/&lt;elapsed seconds&gt;/*;*/&lt;command&gt;/&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HIST_ALLOW_CLOBBER</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Add `*|*&#39; to output redirections in the

<strong>CLOBBER</strong> is unset.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HIST_BEEP</strong> &lt;D&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Beep in ZLE when a widget attempts to access a
history entry which isn&#39;t there.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If the internal history needs to be
trimmed to add the current command line, setting this option will
cause the oldest history event that has a duplicate to be lost before
losing a unique event from the list. You should be sure to set the
value of <strong>HISTSIZE</strong> to a larger number than <strong>SAVEHIST</strong> in order to
give you some room for the duplicated events, otherwise this option
will behave just like <strong>HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS</strong> once the history fills up
with unique events.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HIST_FCNTL_LOCK</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When writing out the history file, by default zsh
uses ad-hoc file locking to avoid known problems with locking on some
operating systems. With this option locking is done by means of the
system&#39;s <strong>fcntl</strong> call, where this method is available. On recent
operating systems this may provide better performance, in particular
avoiding history corruption when files are stored on NFS.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HIST_FIND_NO_DUPS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When searching for history entries in the line
editor, do not display duplicates of a line previously found, even if
the duplicates are not contiguous.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If a new command line being added to the
history list duplicates an older one, the older command is removed
from the list (even if it is not the previous event).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HIST_IGNORE_DUPS</strong> (<strong>-h</strong>)
</dt>
<dd>Do not enter command lines into the
history list if they are duplicates of the previous event.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HIST_IGNORE_SPACE</strong> (<strong>-g</strong>)
</dt>
<dd>Remove command lines from the history
list when the first character on the line is a space, or when one of
the expanded aliases contains a leading space. Only normal aliases
(not global or suffix aliases) have this behaviour. Note that the
command lingers in the internal history until the next command is
entered before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse or edit the
line. If you want to make it vanish right away without entering
another command, type a space and press return.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HIST_LEX_WORDS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>By default, shell history that is read in from
files is split into words on all white space. This means that
arguments with quoted whitespace are not correctly handled, with the
consequence that references to words in history lines that have been
read from a file may be inaccurate. When this option is set, words
read in from a history file are divided up in a similar fashion to
normal shell command line handling. Although this produces more
accurately delimited words, if the size of the history file is large
this can be slow. Trial and error is necessary to decide.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HIST_NO_FUNCTIONS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Remove function definitions from the history
list. Note that the function lingers in the internal history until the
next command is entered before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly
reuse or edit the definition.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HIST_NO_STORE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Remove the <strong>history</strong> (<strong>fc -l</strong>) command from the
history list when invoked. Note that the command lingers in the
internal history until the next command is entered before it vanishes,
allowing you to briefly reuse or edit the line.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Remove superfluous blanks from each command
line being added to the history list.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY</strong> &lt;D&gt;
</dt>
<dd>When the history file is re-written, we
normally write out a copy of the file named <strong>$HISTFILE.new</strong> and then
rename it over the old one. However, if this option is unset, we
instead truncate the old history file and write out the new version
in-place. If one of the history-appending options is enabled, this
option only has an effect when the enlarged history file needs to be
re-written to trim it down to size. Disable this only if you have
special needs, as doing so makes it possible to lose history entries
if zsh gets interrupted during the save.

When writing out a copy of the history file, zsh preserves the old
file&#39;s permissions and group information, but will refuse to write out
a new file if it would change the history file&#39;s owner.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HIST_SAVE_NO_DUPS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When writing out the history file, older
commands that duplicate newer ones are omitted.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>HIST_VERIFY</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Whenever the user enters a line with history
expansion, don&#39;t execute the line directly; instead, perform history
expansion and reload the line into the editing buffer.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option works like <strong>APPEND_HISTORY</strong> except
that new history lines are added to the <strong>$HISTFILE</strong> incrementally (as
soon as they are entered), rather than waiting until the shell exits.
The file will still be periodically re-written to trim it when the
number of lines grows 20% beyond the value specified by <strong>$SAVEHIST</strong>
(see also the <strong>HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY</strong> option).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>INC_APPEND_HISTORY_TIME</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option is a variant of
<strong>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</strong> in which, where possible, the history entry is
written out to the file after the command is finished, so that the
time taken by the command is recorded correctly in the history file in
<strong>EXTENDED_HISTORY</strong> format. This means that the history entry will not
be available immediately from other instances of the shell that are
using the same history file.

This option is only useful if <strong>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</strong> and <strong>SHARE_HISTORY</strong>
are turned off. The three options should be considered mutually
exclusive.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SHARE_HISTORY</strong> &lt;K&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>This option both imports new commands from the history file, and also
causes your typed commands to be appended to the history file (the
latter is like specifying <strong>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</strong>, which should be turned
off if this option is in effect). The history lines are also output
with timestamps ala <strong>EXTENDED_HISTORY</strong> (which makes it easier to find
the spot where we left off reading the file after it gets re-written).</p>
<p>
By default, history movement commands visit the imported lines as well
as the local lines, but you can toggle this on and off with the
set-local-history zle binding. It is also possible to create a zle
widget that will make some commands ignore imported commands, and some
include them.</p>
<p>
If you find that you want more control over when commands get
imported, you may wish to turn <strong>SHARE_HISTORY</strong> off,
<strong>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</strong> or <strong>INC_APPEND_HISTORY_TIME</strong> (see above) on, and
then manually import commands whenever you need them using `*fc* -RI&#39;.</p>

`*/usr/local/bin/X11/xinit*&#39; will be executed (assuming it exists).
Commands explicitly beginning with `*/*&#39;, `*./*&#39; or `*../*&#39; are not

be treated similarly and hence appear as `*077*&#39; instead of `*8#77*&#39;.
This option has no effect on the choice of the output base, nor on the
output of bases other than hexadecimal and octal. Note that these
formats will be understood on input irrespective of the setting of
<strong>C_BASES</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>C_PRECEDENCES</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This alters the precedence of arithmetic operators
to be more like C and other programming languages; the section
ARITHMETIC EVALUATION in /zshmisc/(1) has an explicit list.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD</strong> &lt;D&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Run the <strong>DEBUG</strong> trap before each command;
otherwise it is run after each command. Setting this option mimics the
behaviour of ksh 93; with the option unset the behaviour is that of
ksh 88.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>ERR_EXIT</strong> (<strong>-e</strong>, ksh: <strong>-e</strong>)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>If a command has a non-zero exit
status, execute the <strong>ZERR</strong> trap, if set, and exit. This is disabled
while running initialization scripts.</p>
<p>
The behaviour is also disabled inside <strong>DEBUG</strong> traps. In this case the
option is handled specially: it is unset on entry to the trap. If the
option <strong>DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD</strong> is set, as it is by default, and the option
<strong>ERR_EXIT</strong> is found to have been set on exit, then the command for
which the <strong>DEBUG</strong> trap is being executed is skipped. The option is
restored after the trap exits.</p>
<p>
Non-zero status in a command list containing <strong>&amp;&amp;</strong> or <strong>||</strong> is ignored
for commands not at the end of the list. Hence</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
false &amp;&amp; true
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
does not trigger exit.</p>
<p>
Exiting due to <strong>ERR_EXIT</strong> has certain interactions with asynchronous
jobs noted in the section JOBS in /zshmisc/(1).</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>ERR_RETURN</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>If a command has a non-zero exit status, return
immediately from the enclosing function. The logic is similar to that
for <strong>ERR_EXIT</strong>, except that an implicit <strong>return</strong> statement is executed
instead of an <strong>exit</strong>. This will trigger an exit at the outermost level
of a non-interactive script.</p>
<p>
Normally this option inherits the behaviour of <strong>ERR_EXIT</strong> that code
followed by `*&amp;&amp;*&#39; `*||*&#39; does not trigger a return. Hence in the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
summit || true
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
no return is forced as the combined effect always has a zero return
status.</p>
<p>
Note. however, that if <strong>summit</strong> in the above example is itself a
function, code inside it is considered separately: it may force a
return from <strong>summit</strong> (assuming the option remains set within
<strong>summit</strong>), but not from the enclosing context. This behaviour is
different from <strong>ERR_EXIT</strong> which is unaffected by function scope.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>EVAL_LINENO</strong> &lt;Z&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If set, line numbers of expressions evaluated
using the builtin <strong>eval</strong> are tracked separately of the enclosing
environment. This applies both to the parameter <strong>LINENO</strong> and the line
number output by the prompt escape <strong>%i</strong>. If the option is set, the
prompt escape <strong>%N</strong> will output the string `*(eval)*&#39; instead of the
script or function name as an indication. (The two prompt escapes are
typically used in the parameter <strong>PS4</strong> to be output when the option
<strong>XTRACE</strong> is set.) If <strong>EVAL_LINENO</strong> is unset, the line number of the
surrounding script or function is retained during the evaluation.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>EXEC</strong> (<strong>+n</strong>, ksh: <strong>+n</strong>) &lt;D&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Do execute commands. Without this
option, commands are read and checked for syntax errors, but not
executed. This option cannot be turned off in an interactive shell,
except when `*-n*&#39; is supplied to the shell at startup.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>FUNCTION_ARGZERO</strong> &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
</dt>
<dd>When executing a shell function or
sourcing a script, set <strong>$0</strong> temporarily to the name of the
function/script. Note that toggling <strong>FUNCTION_ARGZERO</strong> from on to off
(or off to on) does not change the current value of <strong>$0</strong>. Only the
state upon entry to the function or script has an effect. Compare
<strong>POSIX_ARGZERO</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LOCAL_LOOPS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When this option is not set, the effect of <strong>break</strong>
and <strong>continue</strong> commands may propagate outside function scope,
affecting loops in calling functions. When the option is set in a
calling function, a <strong>break</strong> or a <strong>continue</strong> that is not caught within
a called function (regardless of the setting of the option within that
function) produces a warning and the effect is cancelled.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LOCAL_OPTIONS</strong> &lt;K&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If this option is set at the point of return
from a shell function, most options (including this one) which were in
force upon entry to the function are restored; options that are not
restored are <strong>PRIVILEGED</strong> and <strong>RESTRICTED</strong>. Otherwise, only this
option, and the <strong>LOCAL_LOOPS</strong>, <strong>XTRACE</strong> and <strong>PRINT_EXIT_VALUE</strong> options
are restored. Hence if this is explicitly unset by a shell function
the other options in force at the point of return will remain so. A
shell function can also guarantee itself a known shell configuration
with a formulation like `*emulate -L zsh*&#39;; the <strong>-L</strong> activates
<strong>LOCAL_OPTIONS</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LOCAL_PATTERNS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If this option is set at the point of return from
a shell function, the state of pattern disables, as set with the
builtin command `*disable -p*&#39;, is restored to what it was when the
function was entered. The behaviour of this option is similar to the
effect of <strong>LOCAL_OPTIONS</strong> on options; hence `*emulate -L sh*&#39; (or
indeed any other emulation with the <strong>-L</strong> option) activates
<strong>LOCAL_PATTERNS</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LOCAL_TRAPS</strong> &lt;K&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this option is set when a signal trap is set
inside a function, then the previous status of the trap for that
signal will be restored when the function exits. Note that this option
must be set <em>prior</em> to altering the trap behaviour in a function;
unlike <strong>LOCAL_OPTIONS</strong>, the value on exit from the function is
irrelevant. However, it does not need to be set before any global trap
for that to be correctly restored by a function. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
unsetopt localtraps
trap - INT
fn() { setopt localtraps; trap &#39;&#39; INT; sleep 3; }
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
will restore normal handling of <strong>SIGINT</strong> after the function exits.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MULTI_FUNC_DEF</strong> &lt;Z&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Allow definitions of multiple functions at
once in the form `*fn1* fn2/…/*()*&#39;; if the option is not set, this
causes a parse error. Definition of multiple functions with the
<strong>function</strong> keyword is always allowed. Multiple function definitions
are not often used and can cause obscure errors.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MULTIOS</strong> &lt;Z&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Perform implicit *tee*s or *cat*s when multiple
redirections are attempted (see the section `Redirection&#39;).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>OCTAL_ZEROES</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Interpret any integer constant beginning with a
0 as octal, per IEEE Std 1003.2-1992 (ISO 9945-2:1993). This is not
enabled by default as it causes problems with parsing of, for example,
date and time strings with leading zeroes.

Sequences of digits indicating a numeric base such as the `*08*&#39;
component in `*08#77*&#39; are always interpreted as decimal, regardless
of leading zeroes.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PIPE_FAIL</strong>
</dt>
<dd>By default, when a pipeline exits the exit status
recorded by the shell and returned by the shell variable <strong>$?</strong> reflects
that of the rightmost element of a pipeline. If this option is set,
the exit status instead reflects the status of the rightmost element
of the pipeline that was non-zero, or zero if all elements exited with
zero status.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SOURCE_TRACE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If set, zsh will print an informational message
announcing the name of each file it loads. The format of the output is
similar to that for the <strong>XTRACE</strong> option, with the message
<strong>&lt;sourcetrace&gt;</strong>. A file may be loaded by the shell itself when it
starts up and shuts down (<strong>Startup/Shutdown Files</strong>) or by the use of
the `*source*&#39; and `*dot*&#39; builtin commands.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>TYPESET_SILENT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If this is unset, executing any of the `*typeset*&#39;
family of commands with no options and a list of parameters that have
no values to be assigned but already exist will display the value of
the parameter. If the option is set, they will only be shown when
parameters are selected with the `*-m*&#39; option. The option `*-p*&#39; is
available whether or not the option is set.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>TYPESET_TO_UNSET</strong> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>When declaring a new parameter with any
of the `*typeset*&#39; family of related commands, the parameter remains
unset unless and until a value is explicity assigned to it, either in
the `*typeset*&#39; command itself or as a later assignment statement.</dd>

<strong>BASH_REMATCH</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When set, matches performed with the <strong>=~</strong> operator
will set the <strong>BASH_REMATCH</strong> array variable, instead of the default
<strong>MATCH</strong> and <strong>match</strong> variables. The first element of the <strong>BASH_REMATCH</strong>
array will contain the entire matched text and subsequent elements
will contain extracted substrings. This option makes more sense when
<strong>KSH_ARRAYS</strong> is also set, so that the entire matched portion is stored
at index 0 and the first substring is at index 1. Without this option,
the <strong>MATCH</strong> variable contains the entire matched text and the <strong>match</strong>
array variable contains substrings.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>BSD_ECHO</strong> &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Make the <strong>echo</strong> builtin compatible with the BSD
/echo/(1) command. This disables backslashed escape sequences in echo
strings unless the <strong>-e</strong> option is specified.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>CONTINUE_ON_ERROR</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If a fatal error is encountered (see the
section ERRORS in /zshmisc/(1)), and the code is running in a script,
the shell will resume execution at the next statement in the script at
the top level, in other words outside all functions or shell
constructs such as loops and conditions. This mimics the behaviour of
interactive shells, where the shell returns to the line editor to read
a new command; it was the normal behaviour in versions of zsh before
5.0.1.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY</strong> &lt;C&gt;
</dt>
<dd>A history reference without an event
specifier will always refer to the previous command. Without this
option, such a history reference refers to the same event as the
previous history reference on the current command line, defaulting to
the previous command.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>CSH_JUNKIE_LOOPS</strong> &lt;C&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Allow loop bodies to take the form `/list/*;

<dt>
<strong>CSH_JUNKIE_QUOTES</strong> &lt;C&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Changes the rules for single- and
double-quoted text to match that of <strong>csh</strong>. These require that embedded
newlines be preceded by a backslash; unescaped newlines will cause an
error message. In double-quoted strings, it is made impossible to
escape `*$*&#39;, `*`*&#39; or `*&#34;<strong>&#39; (and `</strong>\*&#39; itself no longer needs
escaping). Command substitutions are only expanded once, and cannot be
nested.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>CSH_NULLCMD</strong> &lt;C&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Do not use the values of <strong>NULLCMD</strong> and
<strong>READNULLCMD</strong> when running redirections with no command. This make
such redirections fail (see the section `Redirection&#39;).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>KSH_ARRAYS</strong> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Emulate <strong>ksh</strong> array handling as closely as
possible. If this option is set, array elements are numbered from
zero, an array parameter without subscript refers to the first element
instead of the whole array, and braces are required to delimit a
subscript (`*${path[2]}*&#39; rather than just `*$path[2]*&#39;) or to apply
modifiers to any parameter (`*${PWD:h}*&#39; rather than `*$PWD:h*&#39;).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>KSH_AUTOLOAD</strong> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Emulate <strong>ksh</strong> function autoloading. This
means that when a function is autoloaded, the corresponding file is
merely executed, and must define the function itself. (By default, the
function is defined to the contents of the file. However, the most
common <strong>ksh</strong>-style case - of the file containing only a simple
definition of the function - is always handled in the <strong>ksh</strong>-compatible
manner.)</dd>
<dt>
<strong>KSH_OPTION_PRINT</strong> &lt;K&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Alters the way options settings are printed:
instead of separate lists of set and unset options, all options are
shown, marked `on&#39; if they are in the non-default state, `off&#39;
otherwise.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>KSH_TYPESET</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option is now obsolete: a better appropximation
to the behaviour of other shells is obtained with the reserved word
interface to <strong>declare</strong>, <strong>export</strong>, <strong>float</strong>, <strong>integer</strong>, <strong>local</strong>,
<strong>readonly</strong> and <strong>typeset</strong>. Note that the option is only applied when
the reserved word interface is <em>not</em> in use.

Alters the way arguments to the <strong>typeset</strong> family of commands,
including <strong>declare</strong>, <strong>export</strong>, <strong>float</strong>, <strong>integer</strong>, <strong>local</strong> and
<strong>readonly</strong>, are processed. Without this option, zsh will perform
normal word splitting after command and parameter expansion in
arguments of an assignment; with it, word splitting does not take
place in those cases.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Treat use of a subscript of value zero in
array or string expressions as a reference to the first element, i.e.
the element that usually has the subscript 1. Ignored if <strong>KSH_ARRAYS</strong>
is also set.</p>
<p>
If neither this option nor <strong>KSH_ARRAYS</strong> is set, accesses to an element
of an array or string with subscript zero return an empty element or
string, while attempts to set element zero of an array or string are
treated as an error. However, attempts to set an otherwise valid
subscript range that includes zero will succeed. For example, if
<strong>KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT</strong> is not set,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
array[0]=(element)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
is an error, while</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
array[0,1]=(element)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
is not and will replace the first element of the array.</p>
<p>
This option is for compatibility with older versions of the shell and
is not recommended in new code.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>POSIX_ALIASES</strong> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>When this option is set, reserved words are
not candidates for alias expansion: it is still possible to declare
any of them as an alias, but the alias will never be expanded.
Reserved words are described in the section RESERVED WORDS in
/zshmisc/(1).

Alias expansion takes place while text is being read; hence when this
option is set it does not take effect until the end of any function or
other piece of shell code parsed as one unit. Note this may cause
differences from other shells even when the option is in effect. For
example, when running a command with `*zsh -c*&#39;, or even `*zsh -o
posixaliases -c*&#39;, the entire command argument is parsed as one unit,
so aliases defined within the argument are not available even in later
lines. If in doubt, avoid use of aliases in non-interactive code.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>POSIX_ARGZERO</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option may be used to temporarily disable
<strong>FUNCTION_ARGZERO</strong> and thereby restore the value of <strong>$0</strong> to the name
used to invoke the shell (or as set by the <strong>-c</strong> command line option).
For compatibility with previous versions of the shell, emulations use
<strong>NO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO</strong> instead of <strong>POSIX_ARGZERO</strong>, which may result in
unexpected scoping of <strong>$0</strong> if the emulation mode is changed inside a
function or script. To avoid this, explicitly enable <strong>POSIX_ARGZERO</strong>
in the <strong>emulate</strong> command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
emulate sh -o POSIX_ARGZERO
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that <strong>NO_POSIX_ARGZERO</strong> has no effect unless <strong>FUNCTION_ARGZERO</strong>
was already enabled upon entry to the function or script.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>POSIX_BUILTINS</strong> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>When this option is set the <strong>command</strong>
builtin can be used to execute shell builtin commands. Parameter
assignments specified before shell functions and special builtins are
kept after the command completes unless the special builtin is
prefixed with the <strong>command</strong> builtin. Special builtins are <strong>.</strong>, <strong>:</strong>,
<strong>break</strong>, <strong>continue</strong>, <strong>declare</strong>, <strong>eval</strong>, <strong>exit</strong>, <strong>export</strong>, <strong>integer</strong>,
<strong>local</strong>, <strong>readonly</strong>, <strong>return</strong>, <strong>set</strong>, <strong>shift</strong>, <strong>source</strong>, <strong>times</strong>,
<strong>trap</strong> and <strong>unset</strong>.

In addition, various error conditions associated with the above
builtins or <strong>exec</strong> cause a non-interactive shell to exit and an
interactive shell to return to its top-level processing.

Furthermore, functions and shell builtins are not executed after an
<strong>exec</strong> prefix; the command to be executed must be an external command
found in the path.

Furthermore, the <strong>getopts</strong> builtin behaves in a POSIX-compatible
fashion in that the associated variable <strong>OPTIND</strong> is not made local to
functions, and its value is calculated differently to match other
shells.

Moreover, the warning and special exit code from <strong>[[ -o
*/non_existent_option/</strong> ]]* are suppressed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>POSIX_IDENTIFIERS</strong> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>When this option is set, only the ASCII
characters <strong>a</strong> to <strong>z</strong>, <strong>A</strong> to <strong>Z</strong>, <strong>0</strong> to <strong>9</strong> and <strong>_</strong> may be used in
identifiers (names of shell parameters and modules).

In addition, setting this option limits the effect of parameter
substitution with no braces, so that the expression <strong>$#</strong> is treated as
the parameter <strong>$#</strong> even if followed by a valid parameter name. When it
is unset, zsh allows expressions of the form *$#*/name/ to refer to
the length of *$*/name/, even for special variables, for example in
expressions such as <strong>$#-</strong> and <strong>$#*</strong>.

Another difference is that with the option set assignment to an unset
variable in arithmetic context causes the variable to be created as a
scalar rather than a numeric type. So after `*unset t; (( t = 3* ))&#39;.
without <strong>POSIX_IDENTIFIERS</strong> set <strong>t</strong> has integer type, while with it
set it has scalar type.

When the option is unset and multibyte character support is enabled
(i.e. it is compiled in and the option <strong>MULTIBYTE</strong> is set), then
additionally any alphanumeric characters in the local character set
may be used in identifiers. Note that scripts and functions written
with this feature are not portable, and also that both options must be
set before the script or function is parsed; setting them during
execution is not sufficient as the syntax <em>variable/*=*/value</em> has
already been parsed as a command rather than an assignment.

If multibyte character support is not compiled into the shell this
option is ignored; all octets with the top bit set may be used in
identifiers. This is non-standard but is the traditional zsh
behaviour.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>POSIX_STRINGS</strong> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>This option affects processing of quoted
strings. Currently it only affects the behaviour of null characters,
i.e. character 0 in the portable character set corresponding to US
ASCII.

When this option is not set, null characters embedded within strings
of the form <strong>$&#39;*/…/</strong>&#39;* are treated as ordinary characters. The
entire string is maintained within the shell and output to files where
necessary, although owing to restrictions of the library interface the
string is truncated at the null character in file names, environment
variables, or in arguments to external programs.

When this option is set, the <strong>$&#39;*/…/</strong>&#39;* expression is truncated at
the null character. Note that remaining parts of the same string
beyond the termination of the quotes are not truncated.

For example, the command line argument <strong>a$&#39;b\0c&#39;d</strong> is treated with the
option off as the characters <strong>a</strong>, <strong>b</strong>, null, <strong>c</strong>, <strong>d</strong>, and with the
option on as the characters <strong>a</strong>, <strong>b</strong>, <strong>d</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>POSIX_TRAPS</strong> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>When this option is set, the usual zsh
behaviour of executing traps for <strong>EXIT</strong> on exit from shell functions
is suppressed. In that case, manipulating <strong>EXIT</strong> traps always alters
the global trap for exiting the shell; the <strong>LOCAL_TRAPS</strong> option is
ignored for the <strong>EXIT</strong> trap.

Also, a <strong>return</strong> statement executed in a trap with no argument passes
back from the function the value from the surrounding context, not
from code executed within the trap.

Furthermore, if a trap is set to be ignored, this state persists when
a subshell is entered. Without the option, the trap would be reset to
its default state at this point.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SH_FILE_EXPANSION</strong> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Perform filename expansion (e.g., <strong>~</strong>
expansion) <em>before</em> parameter expansion, command substitution,
arithmetic expansion and brace expansion. If this option is unset, it
is performed <em>after</em> brace expansion, so things like `*~$USERNAME*&#39;
and `*~{pfalstad,rc}*&#39; will work.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SH_NULLCMD</strong> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Do not use the values of <strong>NULLCMD</strong> and
<strong>READNULLCMD</strong> when doing redirections, use `*:*&#39; instead (see the
section `Redirection&#39;).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SH_OPTION_LETTERS</strong> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>If this option is set the shell tries
to interpret single letter options (which are used with <strong>set</strong> and
<strong>setopt</strong>) like <strong>ksh</strong> does. This also affects the value of the <strong>-</strong>
special parameter.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SH_WORD_SPLIT</strong> (<strong>-y</strong>) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Causes field splitting to be
performed on unquoted parameter expansions. Note that this option has
nothing to do with word splitting. (See /zshexpn/(1).)</dd>
<dt>
<strong>TRAPS_ASYNC</strong>
</dt>
<dd>While waiting for a program to exit, handle signals
and run traps immediately. Otherwise the trap is run after a child
process has exited. Note this does not affect the point at which traps
are run for any case other than when the shell is waiting for a child
process.</dd>

<strong>PRIVILEGED</strong> (<strong>-p</strong>, ksh: <strong>-p</strong>)

it takes effect during startup.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
#!/bin/zsh -p
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The option is enabled automatically on startup if the effective user
(group) ID is not equal to the real user (group) ID. In this case,
turning the option off causes the effective user and group IDs to be
set to the real user and group IDs. Be aware that if that fails the
shell may be running with different IDs than was intended so a script
should check for failure and act accordingly, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
unsetopt privileged || exit
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <strong>PRIVILEGED</strong> option disables sourcing user startup files. If zsh
is invoked as `*sh*&#39; or `*ksh*&#39; with this option set,
<strong>/etc/suid_profile</strong> is sourced (after <strong>/etc/profile</strong> on interactive
shells). Sourcing <strong>~/.profile</strong> is disabled and the contents of the
<strong>ENV</strong> variable is ignored. This option cannot be changed using the

option.</p>
</dd>

<strong>RESTRICTED</strong> (<strong>-r</strong>)
</dt>
<dd>Enables restricted mode. This option cannot be

section `Restricted Shell&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SHIN_STDIN</strong> (<strong>-s</strong>, ksh: <strong>-s</strong>)

<dd>Commands are being read from the

<strong>SHIN_STDIN</strong> is set explicitly on the command line, any argument that
would otherwise have been taken as a file to run will instead be
treated as a normal positional parameter. Note that setting or
unsetting this option on the command line does not necessarily affect
the state the option will have while the shell is running - that is
purely an indicator of whether or not commands are <em>actually</em> being
read from standard input. The value of this option can only be changed
via flags supplied at invocation of the shell. It cannot be changed
once zsh is running.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SINGLE_COMMAND</strong> (<strong>-t</strong>, ksh: <strong>-t</strong>)
</dt>
<dd>If the shell is reading from
standard input, it exits after a single command has been executed.
This also makes the shell non-interactive, unless the <strong>INTERACTIVE</strong>
option is explicitly set on the command line. The value of this option
can only be changed via flags supplied at invocation of the shell. It
cannot be changed once zsh is running.</dd>

<strong>COMBINING_CHARS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Assume that the terminal displays combining
characters correctly. Specifically, if a base alphanumeric character
is followed by one or more zero-width punctuation characters, assume
that the zero-width characters will be displayed as modifications to
the base character within the same width. Not all terminals handle
this. If this option is not set, zero-width characters are displayed
separately with special mark-up.

If this option is set, the pattern test <strong><a href=":WORD:">:WORD:</a></strong> matches a
zero-width punctuation character on the assumption that it will be
used as part of a word in combination with a word character. Otherwise
the base shell does not handle combining characters specially.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>EMACS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If ZLE is loaded, turning on this option has the equivalent
effect of `*bindkey -e*&#39;. In addition, the VI option is unset. Turning
it off has no effect. The option setting is not guaranteed to reflect
the current keymap. This option is provided for compatibility;
<strong>bindkey</strong> is the recommended interface.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>OVERSTRIKE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Start up the line editor in overstrike mode.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</strong> (<strong>-M</strong>) &lt;K&gt;
</dt>
<dd>Use single-line command line editing
instead of multi-line.

Note that although this is on by default in ksh emulation it only
provides superficial compatibility with the ksh line editor and
reduces the effectiveness of the zsh line editor. As it has no effect
on shell syntax, many users may wish to disable this option when using
ksh emulation interactively.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>VI</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If ZLE is loaded, turning on this option has the equivalent
effect of `*bindkey -v*&#39;. In addition, the EMACS option is unset.
Turning it off has no effect. The option setting is not guaranteed to
reflect the current keymap. This option is provided for compatibility;
<strong>bindkey</strong> is the recommended interface.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>ZLE</strong> (<strong>-Z</strong>)
</dt>
<dd>Use the zsh line editor. Set by default in interactive
shells connected to a terminal.</dd>
