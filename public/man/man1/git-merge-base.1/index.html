DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><em>git merge-base</em> finds the best common ancestor(s) between two commits
to use in a three-way merge. One common ancestor is <em>better</em> than
another common ancestor if the latter is an ancestor of the former. A
common ancestor that does not have any better common ancestor is a <em>best
common ancestor</em>, i.e. a <em>merge base</em>. Note that there can be more than
one merge base for a pair of commits.</p>

OPERATION MODES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>In the most common special case, specifying only two commits on the
command line means computing the merge base between the given two
commits.</p>
<p>
More generally, among the two commits to compute the merge base from,
one is specified by the first commit argument on the command line; the
other commit is a (possibly hypothetical) commit that is a merge across
all the remaining commits on the command line.</p>
<p>
As a consequence, the <em>merge base</em> is not necessarily contained in each
of the commit arguments if more than two commits are specified. This is
different from <strong>git-show-branch*(1) when used with the *–merge-base</strong>
option.</p>
<p>
–octopus</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compute the best common ancestors of all supplied commits, in
preparation for an n-way merge. This mimics the behavior of <em>git
show-branch –merge-base</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–independent</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of printing merge bases, print a minimal subset of the supplied
commits with the same ancestors. In other words, among the commits
given, list those which cannot be reached from any other. This mimics
the behavior of <em>git show-branch –independent</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–is-ancestor</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Check if the first &lt;commit&gt; is an ancestor of the second &lt;commit&gt;, and
exit with status 0 if true, or with status 1 if not. Errors are signaled
by a non-zero status that is not 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–fork-point</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find the point at which a branch (or any history that leads to &lt;commit&gt;)
forked from another branch (or any reference) &lt;ref&gt;. This does not just
look for the common ancestor of the two commits, but also takes into
account the reflog of &lt;ref&gt; to see if the history leading to &lt;commit&gt;
forked from an earlier incarnation of the branch &lt;ref&gt; (see discussion
of this mode below).</p>

DISCUSSION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Given two commits <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, <strong>git merge-base A B</strong> will output a commit
which is reachable from both <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> through the parent
relationship.</p>
<p>
For example, with this topology:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
         o---o---o---B
        /
---o---1---o---o---o---A
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
the merge base between <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> is <em>1</em>.</p>
<p>
Given three commits <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, and <em>C</em>, <strong>git merge-base A B C</strong> will
compute the merge base between <em>A</em> and a hypothetical commit <em>M</em>, which
is a merge between <em>B</em> and <em>C</em>. For example, with this topology:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
       o---o---o---o---C
      /
     /   o---o---o---B
    /   /
---2---1---o---o---o---A
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
the result of <strong>git merge-base A B C</strong> is <em>1</em>. This is because the
equivalent topology with a merge commit <em>M</em> between <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
       o---o---o---o---o
      /                 \
     /   o---o---o---o---M
    /   /
---2---1---o---o---o---A
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
and the result of <strong>git merge-base A M</strong> is <em>1</em>. Commit <em>2</em> is also a
common ancestor between <em>A</em> and <em>M</em>, but <em>1</em> is a better common
ancestor, because <em>2</em> is an ancestor of <em>1</em>. Hence, <em>2</em> is not a merge
base.</p>
<p>
The result of <strong>git merge-base –octopus A B C</strong> is <em>2</em>, because <em>2</em> is
the best common ancestor of all commits.</p>
<p>
When the history involves criss-cross merges, there can be more than one
<em>best</em> common ancestor for two commits. For example, with this topology:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
---1---o---A
    \ /
     X
    / \
---2---o---o---B
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
both <em>1</em> and <em>2</em> are merge bases of A and B. Neither one is better than
the other (both are <em>best</em> merge bases). When the <strong>–all</strong> option is not
given, it is unspecified which best one is output.</p>
<p>
A common idiom to check &#34;fast-forward-ness&#34; between two commits A and B
is (or at least used to be) to compute the merge base between A and B,
and check if it is the same as A, in which case, A is an ancestor of B.
You will see this idiom used often in older scripts.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
A=$(git rev-parse --verify A)
if test &#34;$A&#34; = &#34;$(git merge-base A B)&#34;
then
        ... A is an ancestor of B ...
fi
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In modern git, you can say this in a more direct way:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
if git merge-base --is-ancestor A B
then
        ... A is an ancestor of B ...
fi
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
instead.</p>

DISCUSSION ON FORK-POINT MODE
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>After working on the <strong>topic</strong> branch created with <strong>git switch -c topic
origin/master</strong>, the history of remote-tracking branch <strong>origin/master</strong>
may have been rewound and rebuilt, leading to a history of this shape:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
                 o---B2
                /
---o---o---B1--o---o---o---B (origin/master)
        \
         B0
          \
           D0---D1---D (topic)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
where <strong>origin/master</strong> used to point at commits B0, B1, B2 and now it
points at B, and your <strong>topic</strong> branch was started on top of it back when
<strong>origin/master</strong> was at B0, and you built three commits, D0, D1, and D,
on top of it. Imagine that you now want to rebase the work you did on
the topic on top of the updated origin/master.</p>
<p>
In such a case, <strong>git merge-base origin/master topic</strong> would return the
parent of B0 in the above picture, but B0^..D is <strong>not</strong> the range of
commits you would want to replay on top of B (it includes B0, which is
not what you wrote; it is a commit the other side discarded when it
moved its tip from B0 to B1).</p>
<p>
<strong>git merge-base –fork-point origin/master topic</strong> is designed to help in
such a case. It takes not only B but also B0, B1, and B2 (i.e. old tips
of the remote-tracking branches your repository&#39;s reflog knows about)
into account to see on which commit your topic branch was built and
finds B0, allowing you to replay only the commits on your topic,
excluding the commits the other side later discarded.</p>
<p>
Hence</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ fork_point=$(git merge-base --fork-point origin/master topic)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
will find B0, and</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git rebase --onto origin/master $fork_point topic
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
will replay D0, D1, and D on top of B to create a new history of this
shape:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
                 o---B2
                /
---o---o---B1--o---o---o---B (origin/master)
        \                   \
         B0                  D0--D1--D (topic - updated)
          \
           D0---D1---D (topic - old)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
A caveat is that older reflog entries in your repository may be expired
by <strong>git gc</strong>. If B0 no longer appears in the reflog of the
remote-tracking branch <strong>origin/master</strong>, the <strong>–fork-point</strong> mode
obviously cannot find it and fails, avoiding to give a random and
useless result (such as the parent of B0, like the same command without
the <strong>–fork-point</strong> option gives).</p>
<p>
Also, the remote-tracking branch you use the <strong>–fork-point</strong> mode with
must be the one your topic forked from its tip. If you forked from an
older commit than the tip, this mode would not find the fork point
(imagine in the above sample history B0 did not exist, origin/master
started at B1, moved to B2 and then B, and you forked your topic at
origin/master^ when origin/master was B1; the shape of the history would
be the same as above, without B0, and the parent of B1 is what <strong>git
merge-base origin/master topic</strong> correctly finds, but the <strong>–fork-point</strong>
mode will not, because it is not one of the commits that used to be at
the tip of origin/master).</p>
