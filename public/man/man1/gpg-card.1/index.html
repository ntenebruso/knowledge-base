DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The <strong>gpg-card</strong> is used to administrate smart cards and USB tokens. It
provides a superset of features from <strong>gpg</strong> –card-edit an can be
considered a frontend to <strong>scdaemon</strong> which is a daemon started by
<strong>gpg-agent</strong> to handle smart cards.</p>
<p>
If <strong>gpg-card</strong> is invoked without commands an interactive mode is used.</p>
<p>
If <strong>gpg-card</strong> is invoked with one or more commands the same commands as
available in the interactive mode are run from the command line. These
commands need to be delimited with a double-dash. If a double-dash or a
shell specific character is required as part of a command the entire
command needs to be put in quotes. If one of those commands returns an
error the remaining commands are not anymore run unless the command was
prefixed with a single dash.</p>
<p>
A list of commands is available by using the command <strong>help</strong> and a brief
description of each command is printed by using <strong>help CMD</strong>. See the
section COMMANDS for a full description.</p>
<p>
See the NOTES sections for instructions pertaining to specific cards or
card applications.</p>

COMMANDS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>gpg-card</strong> understands the following commands, which have options of
their own. The pseudo-option ‘–&#39; can be used to separate command
options from arguments; if this pseudo option is used on the command
line the entire command with options and arguments must be quoted, so
that it is not mixed up with the ‘–&#39; as used on the command line to
separate commands. Note that a short online help is available for all
commands by prefixing them with ``help&#39;&#39;. Command completion in the
interactive mode is also supported.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AUTHENTICATE [–setkey] [–raw] [&lt; /file/]|/key/]</strong><br>
<strong>AUTH</strong> :: Authenticate to the card. Perform a mutual authentication
either by reading the key from <em>file</em> or by taking it from the command
line as <em>key</em>. Without the option <strong>–raw</strong> the key is expected to be
hex encoded. To install a new administration key <strong>–setkey</strong> is used;
this requires a prior authentication with the old key. This is used
with PIV cards.</li>
<li><strong>CAFPR [–clear] N</strong> :: Change the CA fingerprint number N of an
OpenPGP card. N must be in the range 1 to 3. The option <strong>–clear</strong>
clears the specified CA fingerprint N or all of them if N is 0 or not
given.</li>
<li><strong>FACTORY-RESET</strong> :: Do a complete reset of some OpenPGP and PIV cards.
This command deletes all data and keys and resets the PINs to their
default. Don&#39;t worry, you need to confirm before the command proceeds.</li>
<li><strong>FETCH</strong> :: Retrieve a key using the URL data object of an OpenPGP card
or if that is missing using the stored fingerprint.</li>
<li><strong>FORCESIG</strong> :: Toggle the forcesig flag of an OpenPGP card.</li>
<li><strong>GENERATE [–force] [–algo=/algo/{+/algo2/}] <em>keyref</em></strong> :: Create a
new key on a card. Use <strong>–force</strong> to overwrite an existing key. Use
&#34;help&#34; for <em>algo</em> to get a list of known algorithms. For OpenPGP cards
several algos may be given. Note that the OpenPGP key generation is
done interactively unless <strong>–algo</strong> or <em>keyref</em> are given.</li>
<li><strong>KDF-SETUP</strong> :: Prepare the OpenPGP card KDF feature for this card.</li>
<li><strong>LANG [–clear]</strong> :: Change the language info for the card. This info
can be used by applications for a personalized greeting. Up to 4
two-digit language identifiers can be entered as a preference. The
option <strong>–clear</strong> removes all identifiers. GnuPG does not use this
info.</li>
<li><strong>LIST [–cards] [–apps] [–info] [–no-key-lookup] [/n/] [/app/]</strong><br>
<strong>L</strong> :: This command reads all information from the current card and
display them in a human readable format. The first section shows
generic information vaialable for all cards. The next section shows
information pertaining to keys which depend on the actual card and
application.

With <em>n</em> given select and list the n-th card; with <em>app</em> also given
select that application. To select an <em>app</em> on the current card use
&#34;-&#34; for <em>n</em>. The serial number of the card may be used instead of <em>n</em>.

The option <strong>–cards</strong> lists the serial numbers of available cards. The
option <strong>–apps</strong> lists all card applications. The option <strong>–info</strong>
selects a card and prints its serial number. The option
<strong>–no-key-lookup</strong> suppresses the listing of matching OpenPGP or X.509
keys.</li>
<li><strong>LOGIN [–clear] [&lt; /file/]</strong> :: Set the login data object of OpenPGP
cards. If <em>file</em> is given the data is is read from that file. This
allows one to store binary data in the login field. The option
<strong>–clear</strong> deletes the login data object.</li>
<li><strong>NAME [–clear]</strong> :: Set the name field of an OpenPGP card. With option
<strong>–clear</strong> the stored name is cleared off the card.</li>
<li><strong>PASSWD [–reset|–nullpin] [/pinref/]</strong> :: Change or unblock the PINs.
Note that in interactive mode and without a <em>pinref</em> a menu is
presented for certain cards.&#34; In non-interactive mode and without a
<em>pinref</em> a default value i used for these cards. The option <strong>–reset</strong>
is used with TCOS cards to reset the PIN using the PUK or vice versa;
the option <em>–nullpin</em> is used for these cards to set the initial PIN.</li>
<li><strong>PRIVATEDO [–clear] <em>n</em> [&lt; /file/]</strong> :: Change the private data object
<em>n</em> of an OpenPGP card. <em>n</em> must be in the range 1 to 4. If <em>file</em> is
given the data is is read from that file. The option <strong>–clear</strong> clears
the data.</li>
<li><strong>QUIT</strong><br>
<strong>Q</strong> :: Stop processing and terminate <strong>gpg-card</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>READCERT [–openpgp] <em>certref</em> &gt; <em>file</em></strong> :: Read the certificate for
key <em>certref</em> and store it in <em>file</em>. With option <strong>–openpgp</strong> an
OpenPGP keyblock wrapped in a dedicated CMS content type
(OID=1.3.6.1.4.1.11591.2.3.1) is expected and extracted to <em>file</em>.
Note that for current OpenPGP cards a certificate may only be
available at the <em>certref</em> &#34;OPENPGP.3&#34;.</li>
<li><strong>RESET</strong> :: Send a reset to the card daemon.</li>
<li><strong>SALUTATION [–clear]</strong><br>
<strong>SALUT</strong> :: Change the salutation info for the card. This info can be
used by applications for a personalized greeting. The option <strong>–clear</strong>
removes this data object. GnuPG does not use this info.</li>
<li><strong>UIF <em>N</em> [on|off|permanent]</strong> :: Change the User Interaction Flag. That
flags tells whether the confirmation button of a token shall be used.
<em>n</em> must in the range 1 to 3. &#34;permanent&#34; is the same as &#34;on&#34; but the
flag can&#39;t be changed anmore.</li>
<li><strong>UNBLOCK</strong> :: Unblock a PIN using a PUK or Reset Code. Note that
OpenPGP cards prior to version 2 can&#39;t use this; instead the <strong>PASSWD</strong>
can be used to set a new PIN.</li>
<li><strong>URL [–clear]</strong> :: Set the URL data object of an OpenPGP card. That
data object can be used by by <strong>gpg</strong>&#39;s <strong>–fetch</strong> command to retrieve
the full public key. The option <strong>–clear</strong> deletes the content of that
data object.</li>
<li><strong>VERIFY [/chvid/]</strong> :: Verify the PIN identified by <em>chvid</em> or the
default PIN.</li>
<li><strong>WRITECERT <em>certref</em> &lt; <em>file</em></strong><br>
<strong>WRITECERT –openpgp <em>certref</em> [&lt; /file/|/fpr/]</strong><br>
<strong>WRITECERT –clear <em>certref</em></strong> :: Write a certificate to the card under
the id <em>certref</em>. The option <strong>–clear</strong> removes the certificate from
the card. The option <strong>–openpgp</strong> expects an OpenPGP keyblock and
stores it encapsulated in a CMS container; the keyblock is taken from
<em>file</em> or directly from the OpenPGP key identified by fingerprint
<em>fpr</em>.</li>
<li><strong>WRITEKEY [–force] <em>keyref</em> <em>keygrip</em></strong> :: Write a private key object
identified by <em>keygrip</em> to the card under the id <em>keyref</em>. Option
<strong>–force</strong> allows overwriting an existing key.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CHECKKEYS [–ondisk] [–delete-clear-copy]
[–delete-protected-copy]</strong> :: Print a list of keys noticed on all
inserted cards. With <strong>–ondisk</strong> only smartcard keys with a copy on
disk are listed. With <strong>–delete-clear-copy</strong> copies of smartcard keys
stored on disk without any protection will be deleted. With
<strong>–delete-protected-copy</strong> password protected copies of smartcard keys
stored on disk will be deleted.</p>
<p>
This command creates missing shadow keys. The delete options print the
status of the keys before they are deleted.</p>
<p>
The format of the output is:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Serial number</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A hex-string with the serial number of the card.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Type</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This gives the type of the card&#39;s application. For example
&#34;OpenPGP&#34; or &#34;PIV&#34;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Keygrip</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A hex-string identifying a key.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Keyref</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The application slot where the key is stored on the
card. For example &#34;OpenPGP.1&#34;</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Status</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The status of the key. The most common value is
&#34;shadowed&#34; for a key where only the public key along with the card&#39;s
serial number is stored on the disk. The value &#34;clear&#34; indicates
that a copy of the card&#39;s key is stored unprotected on disk. The
value &#34;protected&#34; indicated that a copy of the car&#39;s key is stored
on disk but is protected by a password. The value &#34;error&#34; may also
be shown if there was a problem reading information from the card.</dd>

NOTES (PIV)
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>GnuPG has support for PIV cards (``Personal Identity Verification&#39;&#39; as
specified by NIST Special Publication 800-73-4). This section describes
how to initialize (personalize) a fresh Yubikey token featuring the PIV
application (requires Yubikey-5). We assume that the credentials have
not yet been changed and thus are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Authentication key</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is a 24 byte key described by the hex
string<br>
<strong>010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PIV Application PIN</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is the string <strong>123456</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PIN Unblocking Key</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is the string <strong>12345678</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>See the example section on how to change these defaults. For production
use it is important to use secure values for them. Note that the
Authentication Key is not queried via the usual Pinentry dialog but
needs to be entered manually or read from a file. The use of a dedicated
machine to personalize tokens is strongly suggested.</p>
<p>
To see what is on the card, the command <strong>list</strong> can be given. We will use
the interactive mode in the following (the string <em>gpg/card&gt;</em> is the
prompt). An example output for a fresh card is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
gpg/card&gt; list
Reader ...........: 1050:0407:X:0
Card type ........: yubikey
Card firmware ....: 5.1.2
Serial number ....: D2760001240102010006090746250000
Application type .: OpenPGP
Version ..........: 2.1
[...]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
It can be seen by the ``Application type&#39;&#39; line that GnuPG selected the
OpenPGP application of the Yubikey. This is because GnuPG assigns the
highest priority to the OpenPGP application. To use the PIV application
of the Yubikey several methods can be used:</p>
<p>
With a Yubikey 5 or later the OpenPGP application on the Yubikey can be
disabled:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
gpg/card&gt; yubikey disable all opgp
gpg/card&gt; yubikey list
Application  USB    NFC
-----------------------
OTP          yes    yes
U2F          yes    yes
OPGP         no     no
PIV          yes    no
OATH         yes    yes
FIDO2        yes    yes
gpg/card&gt; reset
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <strong>reset</strong> is required so that the GnuPG system rereads the card. Note
that disabled applications keep all their data and can at any time be
re-enabled (use ‘help yubikey&#39;).</p>
<p>
Another option, which works for all Yubikey versions, is to disable the
support for OpenPGP cards in scdaemon. This is done by adding the line</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
disable-application openpgp
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
to ‘/~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf/&#39; and by restarting scdaemon, either by
killing the process or by using ‘gpgconf –kill scdaemon&#39;. Finally the
default order in which card applications are tried by scdaemon can be
changed. For example to prefer PIV over OpenPGP it is sufficient to add</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
application-priority piv
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
to ‘/~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf/&#39; and to restart <strong>scdaemon</strong>. This has an
effect only on tokens which support both, PIV and OpenPGP, but does not
hamper the use of OpenPGP only tokens.</p>
<p>
With one of these methods employed the <strong>list</strong> command of <strong>gpg-card</strong>
shows this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
gpg/card&gt; list
Reader ...........: 1050:0407:X:0
Card type ........: yubikey
Card firmware ....: 5.1.2
Serial number ....: FF020001008A77C1
Application type .: PIV
Version ..........: 1.0
Displayed s/n ....: yk-9074625
PIN usage policy .: app-pin
PIN retry counter : - 3 -
PIV authentication: [none]
      keyref .....: PIV.9A
Card authenticat. : [none]
      keyref .....: PIV.9E
Digital signature : [none]
      keyref .....: PIV.9C
Key management ...: [none]
      keyref .....: PIV.9D
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In case several tokens are plugged into the computer, gpg-card will show
only one. To show another token the number of the token (0, 1, 2, …)
can be given as an argument to the <strong>list</strong> command. The command ‘list
–cards&#39; prints a list of all inserted tokens.</p>
<p>
Note that the ``Displayed s/n&#39;&#39; is printed on the token and also shown
in Pinentry prompts asking for the PIN. The four standard key slots are
always shown, if other key slots are initialized they are shown as well.
The <em>PIV authentication</em> key (internal reference <em>PIV.9A</em>) is used to
authenticate the card and the card holder. The use of the associated
private key is protected by the Application PIN which needs to be
provided once and the key can the be used until the card is reset or
removed from the reader or USB port. GnuPG uses this key with its
<em>Secure Shell</em> support. The <em>Card</em> authentication key (<em>PIV.9E</em>) is also
known as the CAK and used to support physical access applications. The
private key is not protected by a PIN and can thus immediately be used.
The <em>Digital</em> signature key (<em>PIV.9C</em>) is used to digitally sign
documents. The use of the associated private key is protected by the
Application PIN which needs to be provided for each signing operation.
The <em>Key management</em> key (<em>PIV.9D</em>) is used for encryption. The use of
the associated private key is protected by the Application PIN which
needs to be provided only once so that decryption operations can then be
done until the card is reset or removed from the reader or USB port.</p>
<p>
We now generate three of the four keys. Note that GnuPG does currently
not use the the <em>Card authentication</em> key; however, that key is
mandatory by the PIV standard and thus we create it too. Key generation
requires that we authenticate to the card. This can be done either on
the command line (which would reveal the key):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
gpg/card&gt; auth 010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
or by reading the key from a file. That file needs to consist of one LF
terminated line with the hex encoded key (as above):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
gpg/card&gt; auth &lt; myauth.key
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
As usual ‘help auth&#39; gives help for this command. An error message is
printed if a non-matching key is used. The authentication is valid until
a reset of the card or until the card is removed from the reader or the
USB port. Note that that in non-interactive mode the ‘&lt;&#39; needs to be
quoted so that the shell does not interpret it as a its own redirection
symbol.</p>
<p>
Here are the actual commands to generate the keys:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
gpg/card&gt; generate --algo=nistp384 PIV.9A
PIV card no. yk-9074625 detected
gpg/card&gt; generate --algo=nistp256 PIV.9E
PIV card no. yk-9074625 detected
gpg/card&gt; generate --algo=rsa2048 PIV.9C
PIV card no. yk-9074625 detected
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If a key has already been created for one of the slots an error will be
printed; to create a new key anyway the option ‘–force&#39; can be used.
Note that only the private and public keys have been created but no
certificates are stored in the key slots. In fact, GnuPG uses its own
non-standard method to store just the public key in place of the the
certificate. Other application will not be able to make use these keys
until <strong>gpgsm</strong> or another tool has been used to create and store the
respective certificates. Let us see what the list command now shows:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
gpg/card&gt; list

</blockquote>
<p>
The primary information for each key is the <em>keygrip</em>, a 40 byte
hex-string identifying the key. This keygrip is a unique identifier for
the specific parameters of a key. It is used by <strong>gpg-agent</strong> and other
parts of GnuPG to associate a private key to its protocol specific
certificate format (X.509, OpenPGP, or SecureShell). Below the keygrip
the key reference along with the key usage capabilities are show.
Finally the algorithm is printed in the format used by {gpg}. At that
point no other information is shown because for these new keys gpg won&#39;t
be able to find matching certificates.</p>
<p>
Although we could have created the <em>Key management</em> key also with the
generate command, we will create that key off-card so that a backup
exists. To accomplish this a key needs to be created with either <strong>gpg</strong>
or <strong>gpgsm</strong> or imported in one of these tools. In our example we create a
self-signed X.509 certificate (exit the gpg-card tool, first):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ gpgsm --gen-key -o encr.crt
   (1) RSA
   (2) Existing key
   (3) Existing key from card
Your selection? 1
What keysize do you want? (3072) 2048
Requested keysize is 2048 bits
Possible actions for a RSA key:
   (1) sign, encrypt
   (2) sign
   (3) encrypt
Your selection? 3
Enter the X.509 subject name: CN=Encryption key for yk-9074625,O=example,C=DE
Enter email addresses (end with an empty line):
&gt; otto@example.net
&gt;
Enter DNS names (optional; end with an empty line):
&gt;
Enter URIs (optional; end with an empty line):
&gt;
Create self-signed certificate? (y/N) y
These parameters are used:
    Key-Type: RSA
    Key-Length: 2048
    Key-Usage: encrypt
    Serial: random
    Name-DN: CN=Encryption key for yk-9074625,O=example,C=DE
    Name-Email: otto@example.net

Proceed with creation? (y/N)
Now creating self-signed certificate.  This may take a while ...
gpgsm: about to sign the certificate for key: &amp;34798AAFE0A7565088101CC4AE31C5C8C74461CB
gpgsm: certificate created
Ready.
$ gpgsm --import encr.crt
gpgsm: certificate imported
gpgsm: total number processed: 1
gpgsm:               imported: 1
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note the last step which imported the created certificate. If you you
instead created a certificate signing request (CSR) instead of a
self-signed certificate and sent this off to a CA you would do the same
import step with the certificate received from the CA. Take note of the
keygrip (prefixed with an ampersand) as shown during the certificate
creation or listed it again using ‘gpgsm –with-keygrip -k
otto@example.net&#39;. Now to move the key and certificate to the card start
<strong>gpg-card</strong> again and enter:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
gpg/card&gt; writekey PIV.9D 34798AAFE0A7565088101CC4AE31C5C8C74461CB
gpg/card&gt; writecert PIV.9D &lt; encr.crt
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you entered a passphrase to protect the private key, you will be
asked for it via the Pinentry prompt. On success the key and the
certificate has been written to the card and a <strong>list</strong> command shows:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
In case the same key (identified by the keygrip) has been used for
several certificates you will see several ``used for&#39;&#39; parts. With this
the encryption key is now fully functional and can be used to decrypt
messages encrypted to this certificate. <strong>Take care:</strong> the original key is
still stored on-disk and should be moved to a backup medium. This can
simply be done by copying the file
‘/34798AAFE0A7565088101CC4AE31C5C8C74461CB.key/&#39; from the directory
‘/~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d//&#39; to the backup medium and deleting the
file at its original place.</p>
<p>
The final example is to create a self-signed certificate for digital
signatures. Leave <strong>gpg-card</strong> using <strong>quit</strong> or by pressing Control-D and
use gpgsm:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ gpgsm --learn
$ gpgsm --gen-key -o sign.crt

   (1) RSA
   (2) Existing key

<p>
The use of ‘gpgsm –learn&#39; is currently necessary so that gpg-agent
knows what keys are available on the card. The need for this command
will eventually be removed. The remaining commands are similar to the
creation of an on-disk key. However, here we select the ‘Digital
signature&#39; key. During the creation process you will be asked for the
Application PIN of the card. The final step is to write the certificate
to the card using <strong>gpg-card</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
gpg/card&gt; writecert PIV.9C &lt; sign.crt
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
By running list again we will see the fully initialized card:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
It is now possible to sign and to encrypt with this card using gpgsm and
to use the ‘PIV authentication&#39; key with ssh:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ ssh-add -l
384 SHA256:0qnJ0Y0ehWxKcx2frLfEljf6GCdlO55OZed5HqGHsaU cardno:yk-9074625 (ECDSA)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
As usual use ssh-add with the uppercase ‘-L&#39; to list the public ssh key.
To use the certificates with Thunderbird or Mozilla, please consult the
Scute manual for details.</p>
<p>
If you want to use the same PIV keys also for OpenPGP (for example on a
Yubikey to avoid switching between OpenPGP and PIV), this is also
possible:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ gpgsm --learn
