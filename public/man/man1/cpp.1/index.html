DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The C preprocessor, often known as <em>cpp</em>, is a <em>macro processor</em> that is
used automatically by the C compiler to transform your program before
compilation. It is called a macro processor because it allows you to
define <em>macros</em>, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.</p>
<p>
The C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, C++, and
Objective-C source code. In the past, it has been abused as a general
text processor. It will choke on input which does not obey C&#39;s lexical
rules. For example, apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginning of
character constants, and cause errors. Also, you cannot rely on it
preserving characteristics of the input which are not significant to
C-family languages. If a Makefile is preprocessed, all the hard tabs
will be removed, and the Makefile will not work.</p>
<p>
Having said that, you can often get away with using cpp on things which
are not C. Other Algol-ish programming languages are often safe (Ada,
etc.) So is assembly, with caution. <strong>-traditional-cpp</strong> mode preserves
more white space, and is otherwise more permissive. Many of the problems
can be avoided by writing C or C++ style comments instead of native
language comments, and keeping macros simple.</p>
<p>
Wherever possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to the language
you are writing in. Modern versions of the GNU assembler have macro
facilities. Most high level programming languages have their own
conditional compilation and inclusion mechanism. If all else fails, try
a true general text processor, such as GNU M4.</p>
<p>
C preprocessors vary in some details. This manual discusses the GNU C
preprocessor, which provides a small superset of the features of ISO
Standard C. In its default mode, the GNU C preprocessor does not do a
few things required by the standard. These are features which are
rarely, if ever, used, and may cause surprising changes to the meaning
of a program which does not expect them. To get strict ISO Standard C,
you should use the <strong>-std=c90</strong>, <strong>-std=c99</strong>, <strong>-std=c11</strong> or <strong>-std=c17</strong>
options, depending on which version of the standard you want. To get all
the mandatory diagnostics, you must also use <strong>-pedantic</strong>.</p>
<p>
This manual describes the behavior of the ISO preprocessor. To minimize
gratuitous differences, where the ISO preprocessor&#39;s behavior does not
conflict with traditional semantics, the traditional preprocessor should
behave the same way. The various differences that do exist are detailed
in the section <strong>Traditional</strong> Mode.</p>
<p>
For clarity, unless noted otherwise, references to <strong>CPP</strong> in this manual
refer to GNU CPP.</p>

<h2 id="headline-4">
OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The <strong>cpp</strong> command expects two file names as arguments, <em>infile</em> and
<em>outfile</em>. The preprocessor reads <em>infile</em> together with any other files
it specifies with <strong>#include</strong>. All the output generated by the combined
input files is written in <em>outfile</em>.</p>
<p>
Either <em>infile</em> or <em>outfile</em> may be <strong>-</strong>, which as <em>infile</em> means to read
from standard input and as <em>outfile</em> means to write to standard output.
If either file is omitted, it means the same as if <strong>-</strong> had been
specified for that file. You can also use the <strong>-o</strong> <em>outfile</em> option to
specify the output file.</p>
<p>
Unless otherwise noted, or the option ends in <strong>=</strong>, all options which
take an argument may have that argument appear either immediately after
the option, or with a space between option and argument: <strong>-Ifoo</strong> and <strong>-I
foo</strong> have the same effect.</p>
<p>
Many options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter
options may <em>not</em> be grouped: <strong>-dM</strong> is very different from <strong>-d -M</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-D name
</dt>
<dd>Predefine <em>name</em> as a macro, with definition <code class="verbatim">1</code>.</dd>
<dt>
-D name=definition
</dt>
<dd>The contents of <em>definition</em> are tokenized and
processed as if they appeared during translation phase three in a
<strong>#define</strong> directive. In particular, the definition is truncated by
embedded newline characters. If you are invoking the preprocessor from
a shell or shell-like program you may need to use the shell&#39;s quoting
syntax to protect characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the
shell syntax. If you wish to define a function-like macro on the
command line, write its argument list with surrounding parentheses
before the equals sign (if any). Parentheses are meaningful to most
shells, so you should quote the option. With <strong>sh</strong> and <strong>csh</strong>,
<strong>-D&#39;*/name/*(*/args…/</strong>)=*/definition/*&#39;* works. <strong>-D</strong> and <strong>-U</strong>
options are processed in the order they are given on the command line.
All <strong>-imacros</strong> <em>file</em> and <strong>-include</strong> <em>file</em> options are processed
after all <strong>-D</strong> and <strong>-U</strong> options.</dd>
<dt>
-U name
</dt>
<dd>Cancel any previous definition of <em>name</em>, either built in
or provided with a <strong>-D</strong> option.</dd>
<dt>
-include file
</dt>
<dd>Process <em>file</em> as if <code class="verbatim">#include &#34;file&#34;</code> appeared as
the first line of the primary source file. However, the first
directory searched for <em>file</em> is the preprocessor&#39;s working directory
<em>instead of</em> the directory containing the main source file. If not
found there, it is searched for in the remainder of the
<code class="verbatim">#include &#34;...&#34;</code> search chain as normal. If multiple <strong>-include</strong>
options are given, the files are included in the order they appear on
the command line.</dd>
<dt>
-imacros file
</dt>
<dd>Exactly like <strong>-include</strong>, except that any output
produced by scanning <em>file</em> is thrown away. Macros it defines remain
defined. This allows you to acquire all the macros from a header
without also processing its declarations. All files specified by
<strong>-imacros</strong> are processed before all files specified by <strong>-include</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-undef
</dt>
<dd>Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.
The standard predefined macros remain defined.</dd>
<dt>
-pthread
</dt>
<dd>Define additional macros required for using the POSIX
threads library. You should use this option consistently for both
compilation and linking. This option is supported on GNU/Linux
targets, most other Unix derivatives, and also on x86 Cygwin and MinGW
targets.</dd>
<dt>
-M
</dt>
<dd>Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for <strong>make</strong> describing the dependencies of the main source
file. The preprocessor outputs one <strong>make</strong> rule containing the object
file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all the
included files, including those coming from <strong>-include</strong> or <strong>-imacros</strong>
command-line options. Unless specified explicitly (with <strong>-MT</strong> or
<strong>-MQ</strong>), the object file name consists of the name of the source file
with any suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading
directory parts removed. If there are many included files then the
rule is split into several lines using <strong>\</strong>-newline. The rule has no
commands. This option does not suppress the preprocessor&#39;s debug
output, such as <strong>-dM</strong>. To avoid mixing such debug output with the
dependency rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output
file with <strong>-MF</strong>, or use an environment variable like
<strong>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</strong>. Debug output is still sent to the regular
output stream as normal. Passing <strong>-M</strong> to the driver implies <strong>-E</strong>, and
suppresses warnings with an implicit <strong>-w</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-MM
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>-M</strong> but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header. This implies that the
choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an <strong>#include</strong> directive
does not in itself determine whether that header appears in <strong>-MM</strong>
dependency output.</dd>
<dt>
-MF file
</dt>
<dd>When used with <strong>-M</strong> or <strong>-MM</strong>, specifies a file to write
the dependencies to. If no <strong>-MF</strong> switch is given the preprocessor
sends the rules to the same place it would send preprocessed output.
When used with the driver options <strong>-MD</strong> or <strong>-MMD</strong>, <strong>-MF</strong> overrides the
default dependency output file. If <em>file</em> is <em>-</em>, then the
dependencies are written to <em>stdout</em>.</dd>
<dt>
-MG
</dt>
<dd>In conjunction with an option such as <strong>-M</strong> requesting
dependency generation, <strong>-MG</strong> assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error. The dependency filename is taken directly from the
<code class="verbatim">#include</code> directive without prepending any path. <strong>-MG</strong> also
suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders this
useless. This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.</dd>
<dt>
-Mno-modules
</dt>
<dd>Disable dependency generation for compiled module
interfaces.</dd>
<dt>
-MP
</dt>
<dd>This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each
dependency other than the main file, causing each to depend on
nothing. These dummy rules work around errors <strong>make</strong> gives if you
remove header files without updating the <em>Makefile</em> to match. This is
typical output: test.o: test.c test.h test.h:</dd>
<dt>
-MT target
</dt>
<dd>Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency
generation. By default CPP takes the name of the main input file,
deletes any directory components and any file suffix such as <strong>.c</strong>, and
appends the platform&#39;s usual object suffix. The result is the target.
An <strong>-MT</strong> option sets the target to be exactly the string you specify.
If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to <strong>-MT</strong>, or use multiple <strong>-MT</strong> options. For example, <strong>-MT
&#39;$(objpfx)foo.o&#39;</strong> might give $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c</dd>
<dt>
-MQ target
</dt>
<dd>Same as <strong>-MT</strong>, but it quotes any characters which are
special to Make. <strong>-MQ &#39;$(objpfx)foo.o&#39;</strong> gives $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
<strong>-MQ</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-MD
</dt>
<dd><strong>-MD</strong> is equivalent to <strong>-M -MF</strong> <em>file</em>, except that <strong>-E</strong> is not
implied. The driver determines <em>file</em> based on whether an <strong>-o</strong> option
is given. If it is, the driver uses its argument but with a suffix of
<em>.d</em>, otherwise it takes the name of the input file, removes any
directory components and suffix, and applies a <em>.d</em> suffix. If <strong>-MD</strong>
is used in conjunction with <strong>-E</strong>, any <strong>-o</strong> switch is understood to
specify the dependency output file, but if used without <strong>-E</strong>, each
<strong>-o</strong> is understood to specify a target object file. Since <strong>-E</strong> is not
implied, <strong>-MD</strong> can be used to generate a dependency output file as a
side effect of the compilation process.</dd>
<dt>
-MMD
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>-MD</strong> except mention only user header files, not system
header files.</dd>
<dt>
-fpreprocessed
</dt>
<dd>Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has
already been preprocessed. This suppresses things like macro
expansion, trigraph conversion, escaped newline splicing, and
processing of most directives. The preprocessor still recognizes and
removes comments, so that you can pass a file preprocessed with <strong>-C</strong>
to the compiler without problems. In this mode the integrated
preprocessor is little more than a tokenizer for the front ends.
<strong>-fpreprocessed</strong> is implicit if the input file has one of the
extensions <strong>.i</strong>, <strong>.ii</strong> or <strong>.mi</strong>. These are the extensions that GCC
uses for preprocessed files created by <strong>-save-temps</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fdirectives-only
</dt>
<dd>When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not
expand macros. The option&#39;s behavior depends on the <strong>-E</strong> and
<strong>-fpreprocessed</strong> options. With <strong>-E</strong>, preprocessing is limited to the
handling of directives such as <code class="verbatim">#define</code>, <code class="verbatim">#ifdef</code>, and <code class="verbatim">#error</code>.
Other preprocessor operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph
conversion are not performed. In addition, the <strong>-dD</strong> option is
implicitly enabled. With <strong>-fpreprocessed</strong>, predefinition of command
line and most builtin macros is disabled. Macros such as <code class="verbatim">_ _LINE_ _</code>,
which are contextually dependent, are handled normally. This enables
compilation of files previously preprocessed with
<code class="verbatim">-E -fdirectives-only</code>. With both <strong>-E</strong> and <strong>-fpreprocessed</strong>, the rules
for <strong>-fpreprocessed</strong> take precedence. This enables full preprocessing
of files previously preprocessed with <code class="verbatim">-E -fdirectives-only</code>.</dd>
<dt>
-fdollars-in-identifiers
</dt>
<dd>Accept <strong>$</strong> in identifiers.</dd>
<dt>
-fextended-identifiers
</dt>
<dd>Accept universal character names and
extended characters in identifiers. This option is enabled by default
for C99 (and later C standard versions) and C++.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-canonical-system-headers
</dt>
<dd>When preprocessing, do not shorten
system header paths with canonicalization.</dd>
<dt>
-fmax-include-depth=depth
</dt>
<dd>Set the maximum depth of the nested
​#include. The default is 200.</dd>
<dt>
-ftabstop=width
</dt>
<dd>Set the distance between tab stops. This helps the
preprocessor report correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even
if tabs appear on the line. If the value is less than 1 or greater
than 100, the option is ignored. The default is 8.</dd>
<dt>
-ftrack-macro-expansion[=level]
</dt>
<dd>Track locations of tokens across
macro expansions. This allows the compiler to emit diagnostic about
the current macro expansion stack when a compilation error occurs in a
macro expansion. Using this option makes the preprocessor and the
compiler consume more memory. The <em>level</em> parameter can be used to
choose the level of precision of token location tracking thus
decreasing the memory consumption if necessary. Value <strong>0</strong> of <em>level</em>
de-activates this option. Value <strong>1</strong> tracks tokens locations in a
degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode
all tokens resulting from the expansion of an argument of a
function-like macro have the same location. Value <strong>2</strong> tracks tokens
locations completely. This value is the most memory hungry. When this
option is given no argument, the default parameter value is <strong>2</strong>. Note
that <code class="verbatim">-ftrack-macro-expansion=2</code> is activated by default.</dd>
<dt>
-fmacro-prefix-map=old=new
</dt>
<dd>When preprocessing files residing in
directory <em>old</em>, expand the <code class="verbatim">_ _FILE_ _</code> and <code class="verbatim">_ _BASE_FILE_ _</code> macros
as if the files resided in directory <em>new</em> instead. This can be used
to change an absolute path to a relative path by using <em>.</em> for <em>new</em>
which can result in more reproducible builds that are location
independent. This option also affects <code class="verbatim">_ _builtin_FILE()</code> during
compilation. See also <strong>-ffile-prefix-map</strong> and <strong>-fcanon-prefix-map</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fexec-charset=charset
</dt>
<dd>Set the execution character set, used for
string and character constants. The default is UTF-8. <em>charset</em> can be
any encoding supported by the system&#39;s <code class="verbatim">iconv</code> library routine.</dd>
<dt>
-fwide-exec-charset=charset
</dt>
<dd>Set the wide execution character set,
used for wide string and character constants. The default is one of
UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE, UTF-16BE, or UTF-16LE, whichever corresponds to
the width of <code class="verbatim">wchar_t</code> and the big-endian or little-endian byte order
being used for code generation. As with <strong>-fexec-charset</strong>, <em>charset</em>
can be any encoding supported by the system&#39;s <code class="verbatim">iconv</code> library routine;
however, you will have problems with encodings that do not fit exactly
in <code class="verbatim">wchar_t</code>.</dd>
<dt>
-finput-charset=charset
</dt>
<dd>Set the input character set, used for
translation from the character set of the input file to the source
character set used by GCC. If the locale does not specify, or GCC
cannot get this information from the locale, the default is UTF-8.
This can be overridden by either the locale or this command-line
option. Currently the command-line option takes precedence if there&#39;s
a conflict. <em>charset</em> can be any encoding supported by the system&#39;s
<code class="verbatim">iconv</code> library routine.</dd>
<dt>
-fworking-directory
</dt>
<dd>Enable generation of linemarkers in the
preprocessor output that let the compiler know the current working
directory at the time of preprocessing. When this option is enabled,
the preprocessor emits, after the initial linemarker, a second
linemarker with the current working directory followed by two slashes.
GCC uses this directory, when it&#39;s present in the preprocessed input,
as the directory emitted as the current working directory in some
debugging information formats. This option is implicitly enabled if
debugging information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the
negated form <strong>-fno-working-directory</strong>. If the <strong>-P</strong> flag is present in
the command line, this option has no effect, since no <code class="verbatim">#line</code>
directives are emitted whatsoever.</dd>
<dt>
-A predicate=answer
</dt>
<dd>Make an assertion with the predicate
<em>predicate</em> and answer <em>answer</em>. This form is preferred to the older
form <strong>-A</strong> /predicate/*(<strong><em>answer</em></strong>)*, which is still supported, because
it does not use shell special characters.</dd>
<dt>
-A -predicate=answer
</dt>
<dd>Cancel an assertion with the predicate
<em>predicate</em> and answer <em>answer</em>.</dd>
<dt>
-C
</dt>
<dd>Do not discard comments. All comments are passed through to the
output file, except for comments in processed directives, which are
deleted along with the directive. You should be prepared for side
effects when using <strong>-C</strong>; it causes the preprocessor to treat comments
as tokens in their own right. For example, comments appearing at the
start of what would be a directive line have the effect of turning
that line into an ordinary source line, since the first token on the
line is no longer a <strong>#</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-CC
</dt>
<dd>Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion. This
is like <strong>-C</strong>, except that comments contained within macros are also
passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded. In
addition to the side effects of the <strong>-C</strong> option, the <strong>-CC</strong> option
causes all C++-style comments inside a macro to be converted to
C-style comments. This is to prevent later use of that macro from
inadvertently commenting out the remainder of the source line. The
<strong>-CC</strong> option is generally used to support lint comments.</dd>
<dt>
-P
</dt>
<dd>Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the
preprocessor. This might be useful when running the preprocessor on
something that is not C code, and will be sent to a program which
might be confused by the linemarkers.</dd>
<dt>
-traditional
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-traditional-cpp
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Try to imitate the behavior of pre-standard C preprocessors, as opposed
to ISO C preprocessors. Note that GCC does not otherwise attempt to
emulate a pre-standard C compiler, and these options are only supported
with the <strong>-E</strong> switch, or when invoking CPP explicitly.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-trigraphs
</dt>
<dd>Support ISO C trigraphs. These are three-character
sequences, all starting with <strong>??</strong>, that are defined by ISO C to stand
for single characters. For example, <strong>??/</strong> stands for <strong>\</strong>, so <strong>&#39;??/n&#39;</strong>
is a character constant for a newline. By default, GCC ignores
trigraphs, but in standard-conforming modes it converts them. See the
<strong>-std</strong> and <strong>-ansi</strong> options.</dd>
<dt>
-remap
</dt>
<dd>Enable special code to work around file systems which only
permit very short file names, such as MS-DOS.</dd>
<dt>
-H
</dt>
<dd>Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other
normal activities. Each name is indented to show how deep in the
<strong>#include</strong> stack it is. Precompiled header files are also printed,
even if they are found to be invalid; an invalid precompiled header
file is printed with <strong>…x</strong> and a valid one with <strong>…!</strong> .</dd>
<dt>
-dletters
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Says to make debugging dumps during compilation as
specified by <em>letters</em>. The flags documented here are those relevant
to the preprocessor. Other <em>letters</em> are interpreted by the compiler
proper, or reserved for future versions of GCC, and so are silently
ignored. If you specify <em>letters</em> whose behavior conflicts, the result
is undefined.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-dM
</dt>
<dd>Instead of the normal output, generate a list of <strong>#define</strong>
directives for all the macros defined during the execution of the
preprocessor, including predefined macros. This gives you a way of
finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor.
Assuming you have no file <em>foo.h</em>, the command touch foo.h; cpp -dM
foo.h shows all the predefined macros.</dd>
<dt>
-dD
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>-dM</strong> except in two respects: it does <em>not</em> include the
predefined macros, and it outputs <em>both</em> the <strong>#define</strong> directives
and the result of preprocessing. Both kinds of output go to the
standard output file.</dd>
<dt>
-dN
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>-dD</strong>, but emit only the macro names, not their
expansions.</dd>
<dt>
-dI
</dt>
<dd>Output <strong>#include</strong> directives in addition to the result of
preprocessing.</dd>
<dt>
-dU
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>-dD</strong> except that only macros that are expanded, or
whose definedness is tested in preprocessor directives, are output;
the output is delayed until the use or test of the macro; and
<strong>#undef</strong> directives are also output for macros tested but undefined
at the time.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
-fdebug-cpp
</dt>
<dd>This option is only useful for debugging GCC. When used
from CPP or with <strong>-E</strong>, it dumps debugging information about location
maps. Every token in the output is preceded by the dump of the map its
location belongs to. When used from GCC without <strong>-E</strong>, this option has
no effect.</dd>
<dt>
-I dir
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-iquote dir
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-isystem dir
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-idirafter dir
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Add the directory <em>dir</em> to the list of directories to be searched for
header files during preprocessing. If <em>dir</em> begins with <strong>=</strong> or
<code class="verbatim">$SYSROOT</code>, then the <strong>=</strong> or <code class="verbatim">$SYSROOT</code> is replaced by the sysroot
prefix; see <strong>–sysroot</strong> and <strong>-isysroot</strong>. Directories specified with
<strong>-iquote</strong> apply only to the quote form of the directive,
<code class="verbatim">#include &#34;=/=file=/</code>&#34;<code class="verbatim">. Directories specified with *-I*, *-isystem*, or
*-idirafter* apply to lookup for both the =#include &#34;=/=file=/</code>&#34;= and
<code class="verbatim">#include &lt;=/=file=/=&gt;</code> directives. You can specify any number or
combination of these options on the command line to search for header
files in several directories. The lookup order is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>For the quote form of the include directive, the directory of the
current file is searched first.</li>
<li>For the quote form of the include directive, the directories
specified by <strong>-iquote</strong> options are searched in left-to-right order,
as they appear on the command line.</li>
<li>Directories specified with <strong>-I</strong> options are scanned in left-to-right
order.</li>
<li>Directories specified with <strong>-isystem</strong> options are scanned in
left-to-right order.</li>
<li>Standard system directories are scanned.</li>
<li>Directories specified with <strong>-idirafter</strong> options are scanned in
left-to-right order.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You can use <strong>-I</strong> to override a system header file, substituting your own
version, since these directories are searched before the standard system
header file directories. However, you should not use this option to add
directories that contain vendor-supplied system header files; use
<strong>-isystem</strong> for that. The <strong>-isystem</strong> and <strong>-idirafter</strong> options also mark
the directory as a system directory, so that it gets the same special
treatment that is applied to the standard system directories. If a
standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
<strong>-isystem</strong>, is also specified with <strong>-I</strong>, the <strong>-I</strong> option is ignored. The
directory is still searched but as a system directory at its normal
position in the system include chain. This is to ensure that GCC&#39;s
procedure to fix buggy system headers and the ordering for the
<code class="verbatim">#include_next</code> directive are not inadvertently changed. If you really
need to change the search order for system directories, use the
<strong>-nostdinc</strong> and/or <strong>-isystem</strong> options.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
-I-
</dt>
<dd>Split the include path. This option has been deprecated. Please
use <strong>-iquote</strong> instead for <strong>-I</strong> directories before the <strong>-I-</strong> and remove
the <strong>-I-</strong> option. Any directories specified with <strong>-I</strong> options before
<strong>-I-</strong> are searched only for headers requested with
<code class="verbatim">#include &#34;=/=file=/</code>&#34;<code class="verbatim">; they are not searched for
=#include &lt;=/=file=/=&gt;</code>. If additional directories are specified with
<strong>-I</strong> options after the <strong>-I-</strong>, those directories are searched for all
<strong>#include</strong> directives. In addition, <strong>-I-</strong> inhibits the use of the
directory of the current file directory as the first search directory
for <code class="verbatim">#include &#34;=/=file=/</code>&#34;=. There is no way to override this effect
of <strong>-I-</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-iprefix prefix
</dt>
<dd>Specify <em>prefix</em> as the prefix for subsequent
<strong>-iwithprefix</strong> options. If the prefix represents a directory, you
should include the final <strong>/</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-iwithprefix dir
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-iwithprefixbefore dir
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Append <em>dir</em> to the prefix specified previously with <strong>-iprefix</strong>, and add
the resulting directory to the include search path. <strong>-iwithprefixbefore</strong>
puts it in the same place <strong>-I</strong> would; <strong>-iwithprefix</strong> puts it where
<strong>-idirafter</strong> would.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-isysroot dir
</dt>
<dd>This option is like the <strong>–sysroot</strong> option, but
applies only to header files (except for Darwin targets, where it
applies to both header files and libraries). See the <strong>–sysroot</strong>
option for more information.</dd>
<dt>
-imultilib dir
</dt>
<dd>Use <em>dir</em> as a subdirectory of the directory
containing target-specific C++ headers.</dd>
<dt>
-nostdinc
</dt>
<dd>Do not search the standard system directories for header
files. Only the directories explicitly specified with <strong>-I</strong>, <strong>-iquote</strong>,
<strong>-isystem</strong>, and/or <strong>-idirafter</strong> options (and the directory of the
current file, if appropriate) are searched.</dd>
<dt>
-nostdinc++
</dt>
<dd>Do not search for header files in the C++-specific
standard directories, but do still search the other standard
directories. (This option is used when building the C++ library.)</dd>
<dt>
-Wcomment
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-Wcomments
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Warn whenever a comment-start sequence <strong>/*</strong> appears in a <strong>/*</strong> comment,
or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a <strong>//</strong> comment. This warning
is enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-Wtrigraphs
</dt>
<dd>Warn if any trigraphs are encountered that might change
the meaning of the program. Trigraphs within comments are not warned
about, except those that would form escaped newlines. This option is
implied by <strong>-Wall</strong>. If <strong>-Wall</strong> is not given, this option is still
enabled unless trigraphs are enabled. To get trigraph conversion
without warnings, but get the other <strong>-Wall</strong> warnings, use <strong>-trigraphs
-Wall -Wno-trigraphs</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wundef
</dt>
<dd>Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an <code class="verbatim">#if</code>
directive. Such identifiers are replaced with zero.</dd>
<dt>
-Wexpansion-to-defined
</dt>
<dd>Warn whenever <strong>defined</strong> is encountered in
the expansion of a macro (including the case where the macro is
expanded by an <strong>#if</strong> directive). Such usage is not portable. This
warning is also enabled by <strong>-Wpedantic</strong> and <strong>-Wextra</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wunused-macros
</dt>
<dd>Warn about macros defined in the main file that are
unused. A macro is <em>used</em> if it is expanded or tested for existence at
least once. The preprocessor also warns if the macro has not been used
at the time it is redefined or undefined. Built-in macros, macros
defined on the command line, and macros defined in include files are
not warned about. <em>Note:</em> If a macro is actually used, but only used
in skipped conditional blocks, then the preprocessor reports it as
unused. To avoid the warning in such a case, you might improve the
scope of the macro&#39;s definition by, for example, moving it into the
first skipped block. Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with
something like: #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning #endif</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-endif-labels
</dt>
<dd>Do not warn whenever an <code class="verbatim">#else</code> or an <code class="verbatim">#endif</code>
are followed by text. This sometimes happens in older programs with
code of the form #if FOO … #else FOO … #endif FOO The second and
third <code class="verbatim">FOO</code> should be in comments. This warning is on by default.</dd>

ENVIRONMENT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>This section describes the environment variables that affect how CPP
operates. You can use them to specify directories or prefixes to use
when searching for include files, or to control dependency output.</p>
<p>
Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
<strong>-I</strong>, and control dependency output with options like <strong>-M</strong>. These take
precedence over environment variables, which in turn take precedence
over the configuration of GCC.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
CPATH
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
C_INCLUDE_PATH
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Each variable&#39;s value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like <strong>PATH</strong>, in which to look for header files. The
special character, <code class="verbatim">PATH_SEPARATOR</code>, is target-dependent and determined
at GCC build time. For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon. <strong>CPATH</strong>
specifies a list of directories to be searched as if specified with
<strong>-I</strong>, but after any paths given with <strong>-I</strong> options on the command line.
This environment variable is used regardless of which language is being
preprocessed. The remaining environment variables apply only when
preprocessing the particular language indicated. Each specifies a list
of directories to be searched as if specified with <strong>-isystem</strong>, but after
any paths given with <strong>-isystem</strong> options on the command line. In all
these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to search its
current working directory. Empty elements can appear at the beginning or
end of a path. For instance, if the value of <strong>CPATH</strong> is
<code class="verbatim">:/special/include</code>, that has the same effect as <strong>-I.
-I/special/include</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT
</dt>
<dd>If this variable is set, its value specifies
how to output dependencies for Make based on the non-system header
files processed by the compiler. System header files are ignored in
the dependency output. The value of <strong>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</strong> can be just
a file name, in which case the Make rules are written to that file,
guessing the target name from the source file name. Or the value can
have the form <em>file/* */target</em>, in which case the rules are written
to file <em>file</em> using <em>target</em> as the target name. In other words, this
environment variable is equivalent to combining the options <strong>-MM</strong> and
<strong>-MF</strong>, with an optional <strong>-MT</strong> switch too.</dd>
<dt>
SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES
</dt>
<dd>This variable is the same as
<strong>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</strong> (see above), except that system header files are
not ignored, so it implies <strong>-M</strong> rather than <strong>-MM</strong>. However, the
dependence on the main input file is omitted.</dd>
<dt>
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
</dt>
<dd>If this variable is set, its value specifies a
UNIX timestamp to be used in replacement of the current date and time
in the <code class="verbatim">_ _DATE_ _</code> and <code class="verbatim">_ _TIME_ _</code> macros, so that the embedded
timestamps become reproducible. The value of <strong>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</strong> must
be a UNIX timestamp, defined as the number of seconds (excluding leap
seconds) since 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 represented in ASCII; identical to
the output of <code class="verbatim">date +%s</code> on GNU/Linux and other systems that support
the <code class="verbatim">%s</code> extension in the <code class="verbatim">date</code> command. The value should be a known
timestamp such as the last modification time of the source or package
and it should be set by the build process.</dd>
