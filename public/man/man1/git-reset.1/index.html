DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>In the first three forms, copy entries from <strong>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</strong> to the index.
In the last form, set the current branch head (<strong>HEAD</strong>) to <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong>,
optionally modifying index and working tree to match. The
<strong>&lt;tree-ish&gt;*/*&lt;commit&gt;</strong> defaults to <strong>HEAD</strong> in all forms.</p>
<p>
<em>git reset</em> [-q] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [–] &lt;pathspec&gt;…, <em>git reset</em> [-q]
[–pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt; [–pathspec-file-nul]] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These forms reset the index entries for all paths that match the
<strong>&lt;pathspec&gt;</strong> to their state at <strong>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</strong>. (It does not affect the
working tree or the current branch.)</p>
<p>
This means that <strong>git reset &lt;pathspec&gt;</strong> is the opposite of <strong>git add
&lt;pathspec&gt;</strong>. This command is equivalent to <strong>git restore
[–source=&lt;tree-ish&gt;] –staged &lt;pathspec&gt;…</strong>.</p>
<p>
After running <strong>git reset &lt;pathspec&gt;</strong> to update the index entry, you can
use *git-restore*(1) to check the contents out of the index to the
working tree. Alternatively, using <strong>git-restore*(1) and specifying a
commit with *–source</strong>, you can copy the contents of a path out of a
commit to the index and to the working tree in one go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>git reset</em> (–patch | -p) [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [–] [&lt;pathspec&gt;…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interactively select hunks in the difference between the index and
<strong>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</strong> (defaults to <strong>HEAD</strong>). The chosen hunks are applied in
reverse to the index.</p>
<p>
This means that <strong>git reset -p</strong> is the opposite of <strong>git add -p</strong>, i.e. you
can use it to selectively reset hunks. See the “Interactive Mode”
section of <strong>git-add*(1) to learn how to operate the *–patch</strong> mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>git reset</em> [&lt;mode&gt;] [&lt;commit&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This form resets the current branch head to <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong> and possibly
updates the index (resetting it to the tree of <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong>) and the
working tree depending on <strong>&lt;mode&gt;</strong>. Before the operation, <strong>ORIG_HEAD</strong> is
set to the tip of the current branch. If <strong>&lt;mode&gt;</strong> is omitted, defaults
to <strong>–mixed</strong>. The <strong>&lt;mode&gt;</strong> must be one of the following:</p>
<p>
–soft</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does not touch the index file or the working tree at all (but resets the
head to <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong>, just like all modes do). This leaves all your
changed files &#34;Changes to be committed&#34;, as <strong>git status</strong> would put it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–mixed</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resets the index but not the working tree (i.e., the changed files are
preserved but not marked for commit) and reports what has not been
updated. This is the default action.</p>
<p>
If <strong>-N</strong> is specified, removed paths are marked as intent-to-add (see
*git-add*(1)).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–hard</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked files in the
working tree since <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong> are discarded. Any untracked files or
directories in the way of writing any tracked files are simply deleted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–merge</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resets the index and updates the files in the working tree that are
different between <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong> and <strong>HEAD</strong>, but keeps those which are
different between the index and working tree (i.e. which have changes
which have not been added). If a file that is different between
<strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong> and the index has unstaged changes, reset is aborted.</p>
<p>
In other words, <strong>–merge</strong> does something like a <strong>git read-tree -u -m
&lt;commit&gt;</strong>, but carries forward unmerged index entries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–keep</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resets index entries and updates files in the working tree that are
different between <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong> and <strong>HEAD</strong>. If a file that is different
between <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong> and <strong>HEAD</strong> has local changes, reset is aborted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]recurse-submodules</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the working tree is updated, using –recurse-submodules will also
recursively reset the working tree of all active submodules according to
the commit recorded in the superproject, also setting the submodules
HEAD to be detached at that commit.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>

the three commands.</p>

Interrupted workflow</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you are interrupted by an urgent fix request while you are in
the middle of a large change. The files in your working tree are not in
any shape to be committed yet, but you need to get to the other branch
for a quick bugfix.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">

$ work work work      ;# got interrupted
$ git commit -a -m &#34;snapshot WIP&#34;                 (1)
$ git switch master

</pre>
</blockquote>
<table>

<tr>
<td><strong>1.</strong></td>
<td>This commit will get blown away so a throw-away log message is OK.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>2.</strong></td>
<td>This removes the <em>WIP</em> commit from the commit history, and sets your working tree to the state just before you made that snapshot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>3.</strong></td>
<td>At this point the index file still has all the WIP changes you committed as <em>snapshot WIP</em>. This updates the index to show your WIP files as uncommitted.</td>

<p>
Reset a single file in the index</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you have added a file to your index, but later decide you do not
want to add it to your commit. You can remove the file from the index
while keeping your changes with git reset.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git reset -- frotz.c                      (1)
$ git commit -m &#34;Commit files in index&#34;     (2)

<p>
Keep changes in working tree while discarding some previous commits</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you are working on something and you commit it, and then you
continue working a bit more, but now you think that what you have in
your working tree should be in another branch that has nothing to do
with what you committed previously. You can start a new branch and reset
it while keeping the changes in your working tree.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git tag start
$ git switch -c branch1
$ edit
$ git commit ...                            (1)
$ edit
$ git switch -c branch2                     (2)
$ git reset --keep start                    (3)
</pre>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>1.</strong></td>
<td>This commits your first edits in <strong>branch1</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>2.</strong></td>
<td>In the ideal world, you could have realized that the earlier commit did not belong to the new topic when you created and switched to <strong>branch2</strong> (i.e. <strong>git switch -c branch2 start</strong>), but nobody is perfect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>3.</strong></td>
<td>But you can use <strong>reset –keep</strong> to remove the unwanted commit after you switched to <strong>branch2</strong>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>
Split a commit apart into a sequence of commits</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose that you have created lots of logically separate changes and
committed them together. Then, later you decide that it might be better
to have each logical chunk associated with its own commit. You can use
git reset to rewind history without changing the contents of your local
files, and then successively use <strong>git add -p</strong> to interactively select
which hunks to include into each commit, using <strong>git commit -c</strong> to
pre-populate the commit message.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git reset -N HEAD^                        (1)
$ git add -p                                (2)
$ git diff --cached                         (3)
$ git commit -c HEAD@{1}                    (4)
...                                         (5)
$ git add ...                               (6)
$ git diff --cached                         (7)
$ git commit ...                            (8)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>1.</strong></td>
<td>First, reset the history back one commit so that we remove the original commit, but leave the working tree with all the changes. The -N ensures that any new files added with <strong>HEAD</strong> are still marked so that <strong>git add -p</strong> will find them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>2.</strong></td>
<td>Next, we interactively select diff hunks to add using the <strong>git add -p</strong> facility. This will ask you about each diff hunk in sequence and you can use simple commands such as &#34;yes, include this&#34;, &#34;No don&#39;t include this&#34; or even the very powerful &#34;edit&#34; facility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>3.</strong></td>
<td>Once satisfied with the hunks you want to include, you should verify what has been prepared for the first commit by using <strong>git diff –cached</strong>. This shows all the changes that have been moved into the index and are about to be committed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>4.</strong></td>
<td>Next, commit the changes stored in the index. The <strong>-c</strong> option specifies to pre-populate the commit message from the original message that you started with in the first commit. This is helpful to avoid retyping it. The <strong>HEAD@{1}</strong> is a special notation for the commit that <strong>HEAD</strong> used to be at prior to the original reset commit (1 change ago). See *git-reflog*(1) for more details. You may also use any other valid commit reference.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>5.</strong></td>
<td>You can repeat steps 2-4 multiple times to break the original code into any number of commits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>6.</strong></td>
<td>Now you&#39;ve split out many of the changes into their own commits, and might no longer use the patch mode of <strong>git add</strong>, in order to select all remaining uncommitted changes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>7.</strong></td>
<td>Once again, check to verify that you&#39;ve included what you want to. You may also wish to verify that git diff doesn&#39;t show any remaining changes to be committed later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>8.</strong></td>
<td>And finally create the final commit.</td>

<p>
<strong>reset –merge</strong> is meant to be used when resetting out of a conflicted
merge. Any mergy operation guarantees that the working tree file that is
involved in the merge does not have a local change with respect to the
index before it starts, and that it writes the result out to the working
tree. So if we see some difference between the index and the target and
also between the index and the working tree, then it means that we are
not resetting out from a state that a mergy operation left after failing
with a conflict. That is why we disallow <strong>–merge</strong> option in this case.</p>
<p>
<strong>reset –keep</strong> is meant to be used when removing some of the last
commits in the current branch while keeping changes in the working tree.
If there could be conflicts between the changes in the commit we want to
remove and the changes in the working tree we want to keep, the reset is
disallowed. That&#39;s why it is disallowed if there are both changes
between the working tree and <strong>HEAD</strong>, and between <strong>HEAD</strong> and the target.
To be safe, it is also disallowed when there are unmerged entries.</p>
<p>
The following tables show what happens when there are unmerged entries:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
working index HEAD target         working index HEAD
----------------------------------------------------
 X       U     A    B     --soft  (disallowed)
