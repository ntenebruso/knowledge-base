<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The command takes various subcommands, and different options depending
on the subcommand:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git bisect start [--term-(bad|new)=&lt;term-new&gt; --term-(good|old)=&lt;term-old&gt;]

<p>
This command uses a binary search algorithm to find which commit in your
project&#39;s history introduced a bug. You use it by first telling it a
&#34;bad&#34; commit that is known to contain the bug, and a &#34;good&#34; commit that
is known to be before the bug was introduced. Then <strong>git bisect</strong> picks a
commit between those two endpoints and asks you whether the selected
commit is &#34;good&#34; or &#34;bad&#34;. It continues narrowing down the range until
it finds the exact commit that introduced the change.</p>
<p>
In fact, <strong>git bisect</strong> can be used to find the commit that changed <strong>any</strong>
property of your project; e.g., the commit that fixed a bug, or the
commit that caused a benchmark&#39;s performance to improve. To support this
more general usage, the terms &#34;old&#34; and &#34;new&#34; can be used in place of
&#34;good&#34; and &#34;bad&#34;, or you can choose your own terms. See section
&#34;Alternate terms&#34; below for more information.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-4">
Basic bisect commands: start, bad, good
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p>As an example, suppose you are trying to find the commit that broke a
feature that was known to work in version <strong>v2.6.13-rc2</strong> of your project.
You start a bisect session as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git bisect start
$ git bisect bad                 # Current version is bad
$ git bisect good v2.6.13-rc2    # v2.6.13-rc2 is known to be good
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Once you have specified at least one bad and one good commit, <strong>git
bisect</strong> selects a commit in the middle of that range of history, checks
it out, and outputs something similar to the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
Bisecting: 675 revisions left to test after this (roughly 10 steps)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
You should now compile the checked-out version and test it. If that
version works correctly, type</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git bisect good
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If that version is broken, type</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git bisect bad
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then <strong>git bisect</strong> will respond with something like</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
Bisecting: 337 revisions left to test after this (roughly 9 steps)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Keep repeating the process: compile the tree, test it, and depending on
whether it is good or bad run <strong>git bisect good</strong> or <strong>git bisect bad</strong> to
ask for the next commit that needs testing.</p>
<p>
Eventually there will be no more revisions left to inspect, and the
command will print out a description of the first bad commit. The
reference <strong>refs/bisect/bad</strong> will be left pointing at that commit.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-5">
Bisect reset
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>After a bisect session, to clean up the bisection state and return to
the original HEAD, issue the following command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git bisect reset
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
By default, this will return your tree to the commit that was checked
out before <strong>git bisect start</strong>. (A new <strong>git bisect start</strong> will also do
that, as it cleans up the old bisection state.)</p>
<p>
With an optional argument, you can return to a different commit instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git bisect reset &lt;commit&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
For example, <strong>git bisect reset bisect/bad</strong> will check out the first bad
revision, while <strong>git bisect reset HEAD</strong> will leave you on the current
bisection commit and avoid switching commits at all.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-6">
Alternate terms
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Sometimes you are not looking for the commit that introduced a breakage,
but rather for a commit that caused a change between some other &#34;old&#34;
state and &#34;new&#34; state. For example, you might be looking for the commit
that introduced a particular fix. Or you might be looking for the first
commit in which the source-code filenames were finally all converted to
your company&#39;s naming standard. Or whatever.</p>
<p>
In such cases it can be very confusing to use the terms &#34;good&#34; and &#34;bad&#34;
to refer to &#34;the state before the change&#34; and &#34;the state after the
change&#34;. So instead, you can use the terms &#34;old&#34; and &#34;new&#34;,
respectively, in place of &#34;good&#34; and &#34;bad&#34;. (But note that you cannot
mix &#34;good&#34; and &#34;bad&#34; with &#34;old&#34; and &#34;new&#34; in a single session.)</p>
<p>
In this more general usage, you provide <strong>git bisect</strong> with a &#34;new&#34; commit
that has some property and an &#34;old&#34; commit that doesn&#39;t have that
property. Each time <strong>git bisect</strong> checks out a commit, you test if that
commit has the property. If it does, mark the commit as &#34;new&#34;;
otherwise, mark it as &#34;old&#34;. When the bisection is done, <strong>git bisect</strong>
will report which commit introduced the property.</p>
<p>
To use &#34;old&#34; and &#34;new&#34; instead of &#34;good&#34; and bad, you must run <strong>git
bisect start</strong> without commits as argument and then run the following
commands to add the commits:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git bisect old [&lt;rev&gt;]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
to indicate that a commit was before the sought change, or</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git bisect new [&lt;rev&gt;...]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
to indicate that it was after.</p>
<p>
To get a reminder of the currently used terms, use</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git bisect terms
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
You can get just the old term with <strong>git bisect terms –term-old</strong> or <strong>git
bisect terms –term-good</strong>; <strong>git bisect terms –term-new</strong> and <strong>git bisect
terms –term-bad</strong> can be used to learn how to call the commits more
recent than the sought change.</p>
<p>
If you would like to use your own terms instead of &#34;bad&#34;<em>&#34;good&#34; or
&#34;new&#34;</em>&#34;old&#34;, you can choose any names you like (except existing bisect
subcommands like <strong>reset</strong>, <strong>start</strong>, …) by starting the bisection using</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git bisect start --term-old &lt;term-old&gt; --term-new &lt;term-new&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
For example, if you are looking for a commit that introduced a
performance regression, you might use</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git bisect start --term-old fast --term-new slow
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Or if you are looking for the commit that fixed a bug, you might use</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git bisect start --term-new fixed --term-old broken
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then, use <strong>git bisect &lt;term-old&gt;</strong> and <strong>git bisect &lt;term-new&gt;</strong> instead of
<strong>git bisect good</strong> and <strong>git bisect bad</strong> to mark commits.</p>

Bisect visualize/view
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>To see the currently remaining suspects in <em>gitk</em>, issue the following
command during the bisection process (the subcommand <strong>view</strong> can be used
as an alternative to <strong>visualize</strong>):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git bisect visualize
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Git detects a graphical environment through various environment
variables: <strong>DISPLAY</strong>, which is set in X Window System environments on
Unix systems. <strong>SESSIONNAME</strong>, which is set under Cygwin in interactive
desktop sessions. <strong>MSYSTEM</strong>, which is set under Msys2 and Git for
Windows. <strong>SECURITYSESSIONID</strong>, which may be set on macOS in interactive
desktop sessions.</p>
<p>
If none of these environment variables is set, <em>git log</em> is used
instead. You can also give command-line options such as <strong>-p</strong> and
<strong>–stat</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git bisect visualize --stat

<p>After having marked revisions as good or bad, issue the following
command to show what has been done so far:</p>

<p>
If you discover that you made a mistake in specifying the status of a
revision, you can save the output of this command to a file, edit it to
remove the incorrect entries, and then issue the following commands to
return to a corrected state:</p>
<blockquote>

Avoiding testing a commit
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-3">
<p>If, in the middle of a bisect session, you know that the suggested
revision is not a good one to test (e.g. it fails to build and you know
that the failure does not have anything to do with the bug you are
chasing), you can manually select a nearby commit and test that one
instead.</p>
<p>
For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git bisect good/bad                   # previous round was good or bad.
Bisecting: 337 revisions left to test after this (roughly 9 steps)
$ git bisect visualize                  # oops, that is uninteresting.
$ git reset --hard HEAD~3               # try 3 revisions before what
                                        # was suggested
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then compile and test the chosen revision, and afterwards mark the
revision as good or bad in the usual manner.</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-10" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-10">
Bisect skip
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Instead of choosing a nearby commit by yourself, you can ask Git to do
it for you by issuing the command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git bisect skip                 # Current version cannot be tested
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, if you skip a commit adjacent to the one you are looking for,
Git will be unable to tell exactly which of those commits was the first
bad one.</p>
<p>
You can also skip a range of commits, instead of just one commit, using
range notation. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git bisect skip v2.5..v2.6
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This tells the bisect process that no commit after <strong>v2.5</strong>, up to and
including <strong>v2.6</strong>, should be tested.</p>
<p>
Note that if you also want to skip the first commit of the range you
would issue the command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git bisect skip v2.5 v2.5..v2.6
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This tells the bisect process that the commits between <strong>v2.5</strong> and <strong>v2.6</strong>
(inclusive) should be skipped.</p>

<h3 id="headline-11">
Cutting down bisection by giving more parameters to bisect start
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-3">
<p>You can further cut down the number of trials, if you know what part of
the tree is involved in the problem you are tracking down, by specifying
pathspec parameters when issuing the <strong>bisect start</strong> command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git bisect start -- arch/i386 include/asm-i386
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you know beforehand more than one good commit, you can narrow the
bisect space down by specifying all of the good commits immediately
after the bad commit when issuing the <strong>bisect start</strong> command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git bisect start v2.6.20-rc6 v2.6.20-rc4 v2.6.20-rc1 --
                   # v2.6.20-rc6 is bad
                   # v2.6.20-rc4 and v2.6.20-rc1 are good
</pre>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-12" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-12">
Bisect run
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-3">
<p>If you have a script that can tell if the current source code is good or
bad, you can bisect by issuing the command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git bisect run my_script arguments
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that the script (<strong>my_script</strong> in the above example) should exit with
code 0 if the current source code is good/old, and exit with a code
between 1 and 127 (inclusive), except 125, if the current source code is
bad/new.</p>
<p>
Any other exit code will abort the bisect process. It should be noted
that a program that terminates via <strong>exit(-1)</strong> leaves $? = 255, (see the
exit(3) manual page), as the value is chopped with <strong>&amp; 0377</strong>.</p>
<p>
The special exit code 125 should be used when the current source code
cannot be tested. If the script exits with this code, the current
revision will be skipped (see <strong>git bisect skip</strong> above). 125 was chosen
as the highest sensible value to use for this purpose, because 126 and
127 are used by POSIX shells to signal specific error status (127 is for
command not found, 126 is for command found but not executable—these
details do not matter, as they are normal errors in the script, as far
as <strong>bisect run</strong> is concerned).</p>
<p>
You may often find that during a bisect session you want to have
temporary modifications (e.g. s/#define DEBUG 0/#define DEBUG 1/ in a
header file, or &#34;revision that does not have this commit needs this
patch applied to work around another problem this bisection is not
interested in&#34;) applied to the revision being tested.</p>
<p>
To cope with such a situation, after the inner <em>git bisect</em> finds the
next revision to test, the script can apply the patch before compiling,
run the real test, and afterwards decide if the revision (possibly with
the needed patch) passed the test and then rewind the tree to the
pristine state. Finally the script should exit with the status of the
real test to let the <strong>git bisect run</strong> command loop determine the
eventual outcome of the bisect session.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-2">
<p>–no-checkout</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not checkout the new working tree at each iteration of the bisection
process. Instead just update the reference named <strong>BISECT_HEAD</strong> to make
it point to the commit that should be tested.</p>
<p>
This option may be useful when the test you would perform in each step
does not require a checked out tree.</p>
<p>
If the repository is bare, <strong>–no-checkout</strong> is assumed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–first-parent</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit.</p>
<p>
In detecting regressions introduced through the merging of a branch, the
merge commit will be identified as introduction of the bug and its
ancestors will be ignored.</p>
<p>
This option is particularly useful in avoiding false positives when a
merged branch contained broken or non-buildable commits, but the merge
itself was OK.</p>

EXAMPLES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-2">
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git bisect start HEAD origin --    # HEAD is bad, origin is good
$ git bisect run make test           # &#34;make test&#34; builds and tests
$ git bisect reset                   # quit the bisect session

<p>
Automatically bisect a broken test case:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ cat ~/test.sh
#!/bin/sh
make || exit 125                     # this skips broken builds
~/check_test_case.sh                 # does the test case pass?
$ git bisect start HEAD HEAD~10 --   # culprit is among the last 10
$ git bisect run ~/test.sh
$ git bisect reset                   # quit the bisect session
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here we use a <strong>test.sh</strong> custom script. In this script, if <strong>make</strong> fails,
we skip the current commit. <strong>check_test_case.sh</strong> should <strong>exit 0</strong> if the
test case passes, and <strong>exit 1</strong> otherwise.</p>
<p>
It is safer if both <strong>test.sh</strong> and <strong>check_test_case.sh</strong> are outside the
repository to prevent interactions between the bisect, make and test
processes and the scripts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Automatically bisect with temporary modifications (hot-fix):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ cat ~/test.sh
#!/bin/sh

# tweak the working tree by merging the hot-fix branch
# and then attempt a build
if      git merge --no-commit --no-ff hot-fix &amp;&amp;
        make
then
        # run project specific test and report its status
        ~/check_test_case.sh
        status=$?
else
        # tell the caller this is untestable
        status=125
fi

# undo the tweak to allow clean flipping to the next commit
git reset --hard

# return control
exit $status
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This applies modifications from a hot-fix branch before each test run,
e.g. in case your build or test environment changed so that older
revisions may need a fix which newer ones have already. (Make sure the
hot-fix branch is based off a commit which is contained in all revisions
which you are bisecting, so that the merge does not pull in too much, or
use <strong>git cherry-pick</strong> instead of <strong>git merge</strong>.)</p>

This shows that you can do without a run script if you write the test on
