DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The <strong>gzip</strong> command reduces the size of the named files using Lempel-Ziv
coding (LZ77). Whenever possible, each file is replaced by one with the
extension <strong>.gz</strong>, while keeping the same ownership modes, access and
modification times. (The default extension is <strong>z</strong> for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT,
Windows NT FAT and Atari.) If no files are specified, or if a file name
is &#34;-&#34;, the standard input is compressed to the standard output. The
<strong>gzip</strong> command will only attempt to compress regular files. In
particular, it will ignore symbolic links.</p>
<p>
If the compressed file name is too long for its file system, <strong>gzip</strong>
truncates it. The <strong>gzip</strong> command attempts to truncate only the parts of
the file name longer than 3 characters. (A part is delimited by dots.)
If the name consists of small parts only, the longest parts are
truncated. For example, if file names are limited to 14 characters,
gzip.msdos.exe is compressed to gzi.msd.exe.gz. Names are not truncated
on systems which do not have a limit on file name length.</p>
<p>
By default, <strong>gzip</strong> keeps the original file name and timestamp in the
compressed file. These are used when decompressing the file with the
<strong>-N</strong> option. This is useful when the compressed file name was truncated
or when the timestamp was not preserved after a file transfer.</p>
<p>
Compressed files can be restored to their original form using <strong>gzip -d</strong>
or <strong>gunzip</strong> or <strong>zcat</strong>. If the original name saved in the compressed file
is not suitable for its file system, a new name is constructed from the
original one to make it valid.</p>
<p>
<strong>gunzip</strong> takes a list of files on its command line and replaces each
file whose name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, or _z (ignoring case) and
which begins with the correct magic number with an uncompressed file
without the original extension. <strong>gunzip</strong> also recognizes the special
extensions <strong>.tgz</strong> and <strong>.taz</strong> as shorthands for <strong>.tar.gz</strong> and <strong>.tar.Z</strong>
respectively. When compressing, <strong>gzip</strong> uses the <strong>.tgz</strong> extension if
necessary instead of truncating a file with a <strong>.tar</strong> extension.</p>
<p>
<strong>gunzip</strong> can currently decompress files created by <strong>gzip</strong>, <strong>zip</strong>,
<strong>compress</strong>, <strong>compress -H</strong> or <strong>pack</strong>. The detection of the input format
is automatic. When using the first two formats, <strong>gunzip</strong> checks a 32 bit
CRC. For <strong>pack</strong> and <strong>gunzip</strong> checks the uncompressed length. The
standard <strong>compress</strong> format was not designed to allow consistency checks.
However <strong>gunzip</strong> is sometimes able to detect a bad .Z file. If you get
an error when uncompressing a .Z file, do not assume that the .Z file is
correct simply because the standard <strong>uncompress</strong> does not complain. This
generally means that the standard <strong>uncompress</strong> does not check its input,
and happily generates garbage output. The SCO compress -H format (lzh
compression method) does not include a CRC but also allows some
consistency checks.</p>
<p>
Files created by <strong>zip</strong> can be uncompressed by gzip only if they have a
single member compressed with the &#39;deflation&#39; method. This feature is
only intended to help conversion of tar.zip files to the tar.gz format.
To extract a <strong>zip</strong> file with a single member, use a command like
&#39;<strong>gunzip &lt;foo.zip</strong>&#39; or &#39;<strong>gunzip -S .zip foo.zip</strong>&#39;. To extract zip files
with several members, use <strong>unzip</strong> instead of <strong>gunzip</strong>.</p>
<p>
The <strong>zcat</strong> command is identical to <strong>gunzip</strong> <strong>-c</strong>. (On some systems,
<strong>zcat</strong> may be installed as <strong>gzcat</strong> to preserve the original link to
<strong>compress</strong>.) <strong>zcat</strong> uncompresses either a list of files on the command
line or its standard input and writes the uncompressed data on standard
output. <strong>zcat</strong> will uncompress files that have the correct magic number
whether they have a <strong>.gz</strong> suffix or not.</p>
<p>
The <strong>gzip</strong> command uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in <strong>zip</strong> and
PKZIP. The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the
input and the distribution of common substrings. Typically, text such as
source code or English is reduced by 60–70%. Compression is generally
much better than that achieved by LZW (as used in <strong>compress</strong>), Huffman
coding (as used in <strong>pack</strong>), or adaptive Huffman coding (<strong>compact</strong>).</p>
<p>
Compression is always performed, even if the compressed file is slightly
larger than the original. The worst case expansion is a few bytes for
the gzip file header, plus 5 bytes per 32 KiB block, or an expansion
ratio of 0.015% for large files. The actual number of used disk blocks
almost never increases.</p>
<p>
<strong>gzip</strong> normally preserves the mode and modification timestamp of a file
when compressing or decompressing. If you have appropriate privileges,
it also preserves the file&#39;s owner and group.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-a –ascii</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Ascii text mode: convert end-of-lines using local
conventions. This option is supported only on some non-Unix systems.
For MSDOS, CR LF is converted to LF when compressing, and LF is
converted to CR LF when decompressing.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-c –stdout –to-stdout</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Write output on standard output; keep
original files unchanged. If there are several input files, the output
consists of a sequence of independently compressed members. To obtain
better compression, concatenate all input files before compressing
them.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-d –decompress –uncompress</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Decompress.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-f –force</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Force compression or decompression even if the file
has multiple links or the corresponding file already exists, or if the
compressed data is read from or written to a terminal. If the input
data is not in a format recognized by <strong>gzip</strong>, and if the option
–stdout is also given, copy the input data without change to the
standard output: let <strong>zcat</strong> behave as <strong>cat</strong>. If <strong>-f</strong> is not given, and
when not running in the background, <strong>gzip</strong> prompts to verify whether
an existing file should be overwritten.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-h –help</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Display a help screen and quit.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-k –keep</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Keep (don&#39;t delete) input files during compression or
decompression.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-l –list</strong>
</dt>
<dd>For each compressed file, list the following fields:

compressed size: size of the compressed file uncompressed size: size
of the uncompressed file ratio: compression ratio (0.0% if unknown)
uncompressed_name: name of the uncompressed file

The uncompressed size is given as -1 for files not in gzip format,
such as compressed .Z files. To get the uncompressed size for such a
file, you can use:

zcat file.Z | wc -c

In combination with the –verbose option, the following fields are
also displayed:

method: compression method crc: the 32-bit CRC of the uncompressed
data date &amp; time: timestamp for the uncompressed file

The compression methods currently supported are deflate, compress, lzh
(SCO compress -H) and pack. The crc is given as ffffffff for a file
not in gzip format.

With –name, the uncompressed name, date and time are those stored
within the compress file if present.

With –verbose, the size totals and compression ratio for all files is
also displayed, unless some sizes are unknown. With –quiet, the title
and totals lines are not displayed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-L –license</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Display the <strong>gzip</strong> license and quit.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-n –no-name</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When compressing, do not save the original file name
and timestamp by default. (The original name is always saved if the
name had to be truncated.) When decompressing, do not restore the
original file name if present (remove only the <strong>gzip</strong> suffix from the
compressed file name) and do not restore the original timestamp if
present (copy it from the compressed file). This option is the default
when decompressing.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-N –name</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When compressing, always save the original file name,
and save the seconds part of the original modification timestamp if
the original is a regular file and its timestamp is at least 1
(1970-01-01 00:00:01 UTC) and is less than 2**32 (2106-02-07 06:28:16
UTC, assuming leap seconds are not counted); this is the default. When
decompressing, restore from the saved file name and timestamp if
present. This option is useful on systems which have a limit on file
name length or when the timestamp has been lost after a file transfer.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-q –quiet</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Suppress all warnings.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-r –recursive</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Travel the directory structure recursively. If any
of the file names specified on the command line are directories,
<strong>gzip</strong> will descend into the directory and compress all the files it
finds there (or decompress them in the case of <strong>gunzip</strong> ).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-S .suf –suffix .suf</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When compressing, use suffix .suf instead
of .gz. Any non-empty suffix can be given, but suffixes other than .z
and .gz should be avoided to avoid confusion when files are
transferred to other systems.

When decompressing, add .suf to the beginning of the list of suffixes
to try, when deriving an output file name from an input file name.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–synchronous</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use synchronous output. With this option, <strong>gzip</strong> is
less likely to lose data during a system crash, but it can be
considerably slower.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-t –test</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Test. Check the compressed file integrity then quit.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-v –verbose</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Verbose. Display the name and percentage reduction
for each file compressed or decompressed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-V –version</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Version. Display the version number and compilation
options then quit.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-# –fast –best</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Regulate the speed of compression using the
specified digit <strong>#</strong>, where <strong>-1</strong> or <strong>–fast</strong> indicates the fastest
compression method (less compression) and <strong>-9</strong> or <strong>–best</strong> indicates
the slowest compression method (best compression). The default
compression level is <strong>-6</strong> (that is, biased towards high compression at
expense of speed).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–rsyncable</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When you synchronize a compressed file between two
computers, this option allows rsync to transfer only files that were
changed in the archive instead of the entire archive. Normally, after
a change is made to any file in the archive, the compression algorithm
can generate a new version of the archive that does not match the
previous version of the archive. In this case, rsync transfers the
entire new version of the archive to the remote computer. With this
option, rsync can transfer only the changed files as well as a small
amount of metadata that is required to update the archive structure in
the area that was changed.</dd>

ADVANCED USAGE
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Multiple compressed files can be concatenated. In this case, <strong>gunzip</strong>
will extract all members at once. For example:</p>
<p>
gzip -c file1 &gt; foo.gz gzip -c file2 &gt;&gt; foo.gz</p>
<p>
Then</p>
<p>
gunzip -c foo</p>
<p>
is equivalent to</p>
<p>
cat file1 file2</p>
<p>
In case of damage to one member of a .gz file, other members can still
be recovered (if the damaged member is removed). However, you can get
better compression by compressing all members at once:</p>
<p>
cat file1 file2 | gzip &gt; foo.gz</p>
<p>
compresses better than</p>
<p>
gzip -c file1 file2 &gt; foo.gz</p>
<p>
If you want to recompress concatenated files to get better compression,
do:</p>
<p>
gzip -cd old.gz | gzip &gt; new.gz</p>
<p>
If a compressed file consists of several members, the uncompressed size
and CRC reported by the –list option applies to the last member only.
If you need the uncompressed size for all members, you can use:</p>
<p>
gzip -cd file.gz | wc -c</p>
<p>
If you wish to create a single archive file with multiple members so
that members can later be extracted independently, use an archiver such
as tar or zip. GNU tar supports the -z option to invoke gzip
transparently. gzip is designed as a complement to tar, not as a
replacement.</p>

ENVIRONMENT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The obsolescent environment variable <strong>GZIP</strong> can hold a set of default
options for <strong>gzip</strong>. These options are interpreted first and can be
overwritten by explicit command line parameters. As this can cause
problems when using scripts, this feature is supported only for options
that are reasonably likely to not cause too much harm, and <strong>gzip</strong> warns
if it is used. This feature will be removed in a future release of
<strong>gzip</strong>.</p>
<p>
You can use an alias or script instead. For example, if <strong>gzip</strong> is in the
directory <strong>/usr/bin</strong> you can prepend <strong>$HOME/bin</strong> to your <strong>PATH</strong> and
create an executable script <strong>$HOME/bin/gzip</strong> containing the following:</p>
<p>
​#! /bin/sh export PATH=/usr/bin exec gzip -9 &#34;$@&#34;</p>

CAVEATS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When writing compressed data to a tape, it is generally necessary to pad
the output with zeroes up to a block boundary. When the data is read and
the whole block is passed to <strong>gunzip</strong> for decompression, <strong>gunzip</strong>
detects that there is extra trailing garbage after the compressed data
and emits a warning by default. You can use the –quiet option to
suppress the warning.</p>
