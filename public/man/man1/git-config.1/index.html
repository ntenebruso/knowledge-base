DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>You can query/set/replace/unset options with this command. The name is
actually the section and the key separated by a dot, and the value will
be escaped.</p>
<p>
Multiple lines can be added to an option by using the <strong>–append</strong> option.
If you want to update or unset an option which can occur on multiple
lines, a <strong>value-pattern</strong> (which is an extended regular expression,
unless the <strong>–fixed-value</strong> option is given) needs to be given. Only the
existing values that match the pattern are updated or unset. If you want
to handle the lines that do <strong>not</strong> match the pattern, just prepend a
single exclamation mark in front (see also the section called
“EXAMPLES”), but note that this only works when the <strong>–fixed-value</strong>
option is not in use.</p>
<p>
The <strong>–type=&lt;type&gt;</strong> option instructs <em>git config</em> to ensure that
incoming and outgoing values are canonicalize-able under the given
&lt;type&gt;. If no <strong>–type=&lt;type&gt;</strong> is given, no canonicalization will be
performed. Callers may unset an existing <strong>–type</strong> specifier with
<strong>–no-type</strong>.</p>
<p>
When reading, the values are read from the system, global and repository
local configuration files by default, and options <strong>–system</strong>,
<strong>–global</strong>, <strong>–local</strong>, <strong>–worktree</strong> and <strong>–file &lt;filename&gt;</strong> can be used
to tell the command to read from only that location (see the section
called “FILES”).</p>
<p>
When writing, the new value is written to the repository local
configuration file by default, and options <strong>–system</strong>, <strong>–global</strong>,
<strong>–worktree</strong>, <strong>–file &lt;filename&gt;</strong> can be used to tell the command to
write to that location (you can say <strong>–local</strong> but that is the default).</p>
<p>
This command will fail with non-zero status upon error. Some exit codes
are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
The section or key is invalid (ret=1),</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
no section or name was provided (ret=2),</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
the config file is invalid (ret=3),</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
the config file cannot be written (ret=4),</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
you try to unset an option which does not exist (ret=5),</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
you try to unset/set an option for which multiple lines match (ret=5),
or</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
you try to use an invalid regexp (ret=6).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On success, the command returns the exit code 0.</p>
<p>
A list of all available configuration variables can be obtained using
the <strong>git help –config</strong> command.</p>

COMMANDS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>list</p>
<blockquote>
<p>List all variables set in config file, along with their values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
get</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emits the value of the specified key. If key is present multiple times
in the configuration, emits the last value. If <strong>–all</strong> is specified,
emits all values associated with key. Returns error code 1 if key is not
present.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
set</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set value for one or more config options. By default, this command
refuses to write multi-valued config options. Passing <strong>–all</strong> will
replace all multi-valued config options with the new value, whereas
<strong>–value=</strong> will replace all config options whose values match the given
pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
unset</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unset value for one or more config options. By default, this command
refuses to unset multi-valued keys. Passing <strong>–all</strong> will unset all
multi-valued config options, whereas <strong>–value</strong> will unset all config
options whose values match the given pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
rename-section</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rename the given section to a new name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
remove-section</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remove the given section from the configuration file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
edit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Opens an editor to modify the specified config file; either <strong>–system</strong>,
<strong>–global</strong>, <strong>–local</strong> (default), <strong>–worktree</strong>, or <strong>–file
&lt;config-file&gt;</strong>.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>–replace-all</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Default behavior is to replace at most one line. This replaces all lines
matching the key (and optionally the <strong>value-pattern</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–append</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adds a new line to the option without altering any existing values. This
is the same as providing <em>–value=^$</em> in <strong>set</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–comment &lt;message&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Append a comment at the end of new or modified lines.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
If _&lt;message&gt;_ begins with one or more whitespaces followed
by &#34;#&#34;, it is used as-is.  If it begins with &#34;#&#34;, a space is
prepended before it is used.  Otherwise, a string &#34; # &#34; (a
space followed by a hash followed by a space) is prepended
to it.  And the resulting string is placed immediately after
the value defined for the variable.  The _&lt;message&gt;_ must
not contain linefeed characters (no multi-line comments are
permitted).
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
–all</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With <strong>get</strong>, return all values for a multi-valued key.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–regexp</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With <strong>get</strong>, interpret the name as a regular expression. Regular
expression matching is currently case-sensitive and done against a
canonicalized version of the key in which section and variable names are
lowercased, but subsection names are not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–url=&lt;URL&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When given a two-part &lt;name&gt; as &lt;section&gt;.&lt;key&gt;, the value for
&lt;section&gt;.&lt;URL&gt;.&lt;key&gt; whose &lt;URL&gt; part matches the best to the given URL
is returned (if no such key exists, the value for &lt;section&gt;.&lt;key&gt; is
used as a fallback). When given just the &lt;section&gt; as name, do so for
all the keys in the section and list them. Returns error code 1 if no
value is found.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–global</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For writing options: write to global <strong>~/.gitconfig</strong> file rather than the
repository <strong>.git/config</strong>, write to <strong>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config</strong> file if
this file exists and the <strong>~/.gitconfig</strong> file doesn&#39;t.</p>
<p>
For reading options: read only from global <strong>~/.gitconfig</strong> and from
<strong>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config</strong> rather than from all available files.</p>
<p>
See also the section called “FILES”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–system</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For writing options: write to system-wide <strong>$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig</strong>
rather than the repository <strong>.git/config</strong>.</p>
<p>
For reading options: read only from system-wide
<strong>$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig</strong> rather than from all available files.</p>
<p>
See also the section called “FILES”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–local</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For writing options: write to the repository <strong>.git/config</strong> file. This is
the default behavior.</p>
<p>
For reading options: read only from the repository <strong>.git/config</strong> rather
than from all available files.</p>
<p>
See also the section called “FILES”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–worktree</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similar to <strong>–local</strong> except that <strong>$GIT_DIR/config.worktree</strong> is read from
or written to if <strong>extensions.worktreeConfig</strong> is enabled. If not it&#39;s the
same as <strong>–local</strong>. Note that <strong>$GIT_DIR</strong> is equal to <strong>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</strong>
for the main working tree, but is of the form <strong>$GIT_DIR/worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/</strong>
for other working trees. See <strong>git-worktree*(1) to learn how to enable
*extensions.worktreeConfig</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-f &lt;config-file&gt;, –file &lt;config-file&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For writing options: write to the specified file rather than the
repository <strong>.git/config</strong>.</p>
<p>
For reading options: read only from the specified file rather than from
all available files.</p>
<p>
See also the section called “FILES”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–blob &lt;blob&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similar to <strong>–file</strong> but use the given blob instead of a file. E.g. you
can use <em>master:.gitmodules</em> to read values from the file <em>.gitmodules</em>
in the master branch. See &#34;SPECIFYING REVISIONS&#34; section in
*gitrevisions*(7) for a more complete list of ways to spell blob names.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–fixed-value</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When used with the <strong>value-pattern</strong> argument, treat <strong>value-pattern</strong> as an
exact string instead of a regular expression. This will restrict the
name/value pairs that are matched to only those where the value is
exactly equal to the <strong>value-pattern</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–type &lt;type&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>git config</em> will ensure that any input or output is valid under the
given type constraint(s), and will canonicalize outgoing values in
*&lt;type&gt;*s canonical form.</p>
<p>
Valid *&lt;type&gt;*s include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>bool</em>: canonicalize values as either &#34;true&#34; or &#34;false&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>int</em>: canonicalize values as simple decimal numbers. An optional suffix
of <em>k</em>, <em>m</em>, or <em>g</em> will cause the value to be multiplied by 1024,
1048576, or 1073741824 upon input.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>bool-or-int</em>: canonicalize according to either <em>bool</em> or <em>int</em>, as
described above.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>path</em>: canonicalize by expanding a leading <strong>~</strong> to the value of <strong>$HOME</strong>
and <strong>~user</strong> to the home directory for the specified user. This specifier
has no effect when setting the value (but you can use <strong>git config
section.variable ~/</strong> from the command line to let your shell do the
expansion.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>expiry-date</em>: canonicalize by converting from a fixed or relative
date-string to a timestamp. This specifier has no effect when setting
the value.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>color</em>: When getting a value, canonicalize by converting to an ANSI
color escape sequence. When setting a value, a sanity-check is performed
to ensure that the given value is canonicalize-able as an ANSI color,
but it is written as-is.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
–bool, –int, –bool-or-int, –path, –expiry-date</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Historical options for selecting a type specifier. Prefer instead
<strong>–type</strong> (see above).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-type</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Un-sets the previously set type specifier (if one was previously set).
This option requests that <em>git config</em> not canonicalize the retrieved
variable. <strong>–no-type</strong> has no effect without <strong>–type=&lt;type&gt;</strong> or
<strong>–&lt;type&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-z, –null</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For all options that output values and/or keys, always end values with
the null character (instead of a newline). Use newline instead as a
delimiter between key and value. This allows for secure parsing of the
output without getting confused e.g. by values that contain line breaks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–name-only</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output only the names of config variables for <strong>list</strong> or <strong>get</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–show-origin</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Augment the output of all queried config options with the origin type
(file, standard input, blob, command line) and the actual origin (config
file path, ref, or blob id if applicable).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–show-scope</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similar to <strong>–show-origin</strong> in that it augments the output of all queried
config options with the scope of that value (worktree, local, global,
system, command).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–get-colorbool &lt;name&gt; [&lt;stdout-is-tty&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find the color setting for <strong>&lt;name&gt;</strong> (e.g. <strong>color.diff</strong>) and output
&#34;true&#34; or &#34;false&#34;. <strong>&lt;stdout-is-tty&gt;</strong> should be either &#34;true&#34; or &#34;false&#34;,
and is taken into account when configuration says &#34;auto&#34;. If
<strong>&lt;stdout-is-tty&gt;</strong> is missing, then checks the standard output of the
command itself, and exits with status 0 if color is to be used, or exits
with status 1 otherwise. When the color setting for <strong>name</strong> is undefined,
the command uses <strong>color.ui</strong> as fallback.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]includes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Respect <strong>include.*</strong> directives in config files when looking up values.
Defaults to <strong>off</strong> when a specific file is given (e.g., using <strong>–file</strong>,
<strong>–global</strong>, etc) and <strong>on</strong> when searching all config files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–default &lt;value&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When using <strong>get</strong>, and the requested variable is not found, behave as if
&lt;value&gt; were the value assigned to that variable.</p>

<p>
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config, ~/.gitconfig</p>
<blockquote>
<p>User-specific configuration files. When the XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment
variable is not set or empty, $HOME/.config/ is used as
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME.</p>
<p>
These are also called &#34;global&#34; configuration files. If both files exist,
both files are read in the order given above.</p>

<p>
$GIT_DIR/config.worktree</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
You may also provide additional configuration parameters when running
any git command by using the <strong>-c</strong> option. See *git*(1) for details.</p>
<p>
Options will be read from all of these files that are available. If the
global or the system-wide configuration files are missing or unreadable
they will be ignored. If the repository configuration file is missing or
unreadable, <em>git config</em> will exit with a non-zero error code. An error
message is produced if the file is unreadable, but not if it is missing.</p>
<p>
The files are read in the order given above, with last value found
taking precedence over values read earlier. When multiple values are
taken then all values of a key from all files will be used.</p>
<p>
By default, options are only written to the repository specific
configuration file. Note that this also affects options like <strong>set</strong> and
<strong>unset</strong>. /git config/* will only ever change one file at a time*.</p>
<p>
You can limit which configuration sources are read from or written to by
specifying the path of a file with the <strong>–file</strong> option, or by specifying
a configuration scope with <strong>–system</strong>, <strong>–global</strong>, <strong>–local</strong>, or
<strong>–worktree</strong>. For more, see the section called “OPTIONS” above.</p>

Git treats these scopes as if they are controlled by the user or a

GIT_CONFIG_COUNT, GIT_CONFIG_KEY_&lt;n&gt;, GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If GIT_CONFIG_COUNT is set to a positive number, all environment pairs
GIT_CONFIG_KEY_&lt;n&gt; and GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_&lt;n&gt; up to that number will be
added to the process&#39;s runtime configuration. The config pairs are
zero-indexed. Any missing key or value is treated as an error. An empty
GIT_CONFIG_COUNT is treated the same as GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=0, namely no
pairs are processed. These environment variables will override values in
configuration files, but will be overridden by any explicit options
passed via <strong>git -c</strong>.</p>
<p>
This is useful for cases where you want to spawn multiple git commands
with a common configuration but cannot depend on a configuration file,
for example when writing scripts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
GIT_CONFIG</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If no <strong>–file</strong> option is provided to <strong>git config</strong>, use the file given by
<strong>GIT_CONFIG</strong> as if it were provided via <strong>–file</strong>. This variable has no
effect on other Git commands, and is mostly for historical
compatibility; there is generally no reason to use it instead of the
<strong>–file</strong> option.</p>

EXAMPLES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Given a .git/config like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
#
# This is the config file, and

        sslVerify = false

</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
you can set the filemode to true with</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
% git config set core.filemode true
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The hypothetical proxy command entries actually have a postfix to
discern what URL they apply to. Here is how to change the entry for
kernel.org to &#34;ssh&#34;.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
% git config set --value=for kernel.org$ core.gitproxy &#34;ssh&#34; for kernel.org
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This makes sure that only the key/value pair for kernel.org is replaced.</p>
<p>
To delete the entry for renames, do</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
% git config unset diff.renames
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you want to delete an entry for a multivar (like core.gitproxy
above), you have to provide a regex matching the value of exactly one
line.</p>
<p>
To query the value for a given key, do</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
% git config get core.filemode
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
or, to query a multivar:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
% git config get --value=&#34;for kernel.org$&#34; core.gitproxy
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you want to know all the values for a multivar, do:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
% git config get --all --show-names core.gitproxy
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you like to live dangerously, you can replace <strong>all</strong> core.gitproxy by
a new one with</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
% git config set --all core.gitproxy ssh
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, if you really only want to replace the line for the default
proxy, i.e. the one without a &#34;for …&#34; postfix, do something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
% git config set --value=! for  core.gitproxy ssh
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
To actually match only values with an exclamation mark, you have to</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
% git config set --value=[!] section.key value
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
To add a new proxy, without altering any of the existing ones, use</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
% git config set --append core.gitproxy &#34;proxy-command&#34; for example.com
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
An example to use customized color from the configuration in your
script:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
#!/bin/sh
WS=$(git config get --type=color --default=&#34;blue reverse&#34; color.diff.whitespace)
RESET=$(git config get --type=color --default=&#34;reset&#34; &#34;&#34;)
echo &#34;${WS}your whitespace color or blue reverse${RESET}&#34;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
For URLs in <strong><a href="https://weak.example.com">https://weak.example.com</a></strong>, <strong>http.sslVerify</strong> is set to
false, while it is set to <strong>true</strong> for all others:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
% git config get --type=bool --url=https://good.example.com http.sslverify
true
% git config get --type=bool --url=https://weak.example.com http.sslverify

<h2 id="headline-13">
CONFIGURATION FILE
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The Git configuration file contains a number of variables that affect
the Git commands behavior. The files <strong>.git/config</strong> and optionally
<strong>config.worktree</strong> (see the &#34;CONFIGURATION FILE&#34; section of
<strong>git-worktree*(1)) in each repository are used to store the
configuration for that repository, and *$HOME/.gitconfig</strong> is used to
store a per-user configuration as fallback values for the <strong>.git/config</strong>
file. The file <strong>/etc/gitconfig</strong> can be used to store a system-wide
default configuration.</p>
<p>
The configuration variables are used by both the Git plumbing and the
porcelain commands. The variables are divided into sections, wherein the
fully qualified variable name of the variable itself is the last
dot-separated segment and the section name is everything before the last
dot. The variable names are case-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric
characters and <strong>-</strong>, and must start with an alphabetic character. Some
variables may appear multiple times; we say then that the variable is
multivalued.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-14" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-14">
Syntax
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The syntax is fairly flexible and permissive. Whitespace characters,
which in this context are the space character (SP) and the horizontal
tabulation (HT), are mostly ignored. The <em>#</em> and <em>;</em> characters begin
comments to the end of line. Blank lines are ignored.</p>
<p>
The file consists of sections and variables. A section begins with the
name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next
section begins. Section names are case-insensitive. Only alphanumeric
characters, <strong>-</strong> and <strong>.</strong> are allowed in section names. Each variable must
belong to some section, which means that there must be a section header
before the first setting of a variable.</p>
<p>
Sections can be further divided into subsections. To begin a subsection
put its name in double quotes, separated by space from the section name,
in the section header, like in the example below:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        [section &#34;subsection&#34;]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Subsection names are case sensitive and can contain any characters
except newline and the null byte. Doublequote <strong>&#34;</strong> and backslash can be
included by escaping them as <strong>\&#34;</strong> and <strong>\\</strong>, respectively. Backslashes
preceding other characters are dropped when reading; for example, <strong>\t</strong>
is read as <strong>t</strong> and <strong>\0</strong> is read as <strong>0</strong>. Section headers cannot span
multiple lines. Variables may belong directly to a section or to a given
subsection. You can have <strong>[section]</strong> if you have <strong>[section
&#34;subsection&#34;]</strong>, but you don&#39;t need to.</p>
<p>
There is also a deprecated <strong>[section.subsection]</strong> syntax. With this
syntax, the subsection name is converted to lower-case and is also
compared case sensitively. These subsection names follow the same
restrictions as section names.</p>
<p>
All the other lines (and the remainder of the line after the section
header) are recognized as setting variables, in the form <em>name = value</em>
(or just <em>name</em>, which is a short-hand to say that the variable is the
boolean &#34;true&#34;). The variable names are case-insensitive, allow only
alphanumeric characters and <strong>-</strong>, and must start with an alphabetic
character.</p>
<p>
Whitespace characters surrounding <strong>name</strong>, <strong>=</strong> and <strong>value</strong> are discarded.
Internal whitespace characters within <em>value</em> are retained verbatim.
Comments starting with either <strong>#</strong> or <strong>;</strong> and extending to the end of
line are discarded. A line that defines a value can be continued to the
next line by ending it with a backslash (<strong>\</strong>); the backslash and the
end-of-line characters are discarded.</p>
<p>
If <strong>value</strong> needs to contain leading or trailing whitespace characters,
it must be enclosed in double quotation marks (<strong>&#34;</strong>). Inside double
quotation marks, double quote (<strong>&#34;</strong>) and backslash (<strong>\</strong>) characters must
be escaped: use <strong>\&#34;</strong> for <strong>&#34;</strong> and <strong>\\</strong> for <strong>\</strong>.</p>
<p>
The following escape sequences (beside <strong>\&#34;</strong> and <strong>\\</strong>) are recognized:
<strong>\n</strong> for newline character (NL), <strong>\t</strong> for horizontal tabulation (HT,
TAB) and <strong>\b</strong> for backspace (BS). Other char escape sequences (including
octal escape sequences) are invalid.</p>

Includes
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The <strong>include</strong> and <strong>includeIf</strong> sections allow you to include config
directives from another source. These sections behave identically to
each other with the exception that <strong>includeIf</strong> sections may be ignored
if their condition does not evaluate to true; see &#34;Conditional includes&#34;
below.</p>
<p>
You can include a config file from another by setting the special
<strong>include.path</strong> (or <strong>includeIf.</strong>.path*) variable to the name of the file
to be included. The variable takes a pathname as its value, and is
subject to tilde expansion. These variables can be given multiple times.</p>
<p>
The contents of the included file are inserted immediately, as if they
had been found at the location of the include directive. If the value of
the variable is a relative path, the path is considered to be relative
to the configuration file in which the include directive was found. See
below for examples.</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-headline-16" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-16">
Conditional includes
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-16" class="outline-text-3">
<p>You can conditionally include a config file from another by setting an
<strong>includeIf.&lt;condition&gt;.path</strong> variable to the name of the file to be
included.</p>
<p>
The condition starts with a keyword followed by a colon and some data
whose format and meaning depends on the keyword. Supported keywords are:</p>
<p>
<strong>gitdir</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data that follows the keyword <strong>gitdir:</strong> is used as a glob pattern.
If the location of the .git directory matches the pattern, the include
condition is met.</p>
<p>
The .git location may be auto-discovered, or come from <strong>$GIT_DIR</strong>
environment variable. If the repository is auto-discovered via a .git
file (e.g. from submodules, or a linked worktree), the .git location
would be the final location where the .git directory is, not where the
.git file is.</p>
<p>
The pattern can contain standard globbing wildcards and two additional
ones, <strong>**/</strong> and <strong>/**</strong>, that can match multiple path components. Please
refer to *gitignore*(5) for details. For convenience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
If the pattern starts with <strong>~/</strong>, <strong>~</strong> will be substituted with the
content of the environment variable <strong>HOME</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
If the pattern starts with <strong>./</strong>, it is replaced with the directory
containing the current config file.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
If the pattern does not start with either <strong>~/</strong>, <strong>./</strong> or <strong>/</strong>, <strong>**/</strong> will
be automatically prepended. For example, the pattern <strong>foo/bar</strong> becomes
<strong>**/foo/bar</strong> and would match <strong>/any/path/to/foo/bar</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
If the pattern ends with <strong>/</strong>, <strong>**</strong> will be automatically added. For
example, the pattern <strong>foo/</strong> becomes <strong>foo/**</strong>. In other words, it matches
&#34;foo&#34; and everything inside, recursively.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>gitdir/i</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the same as <strong>gitdir</strong> except that matching is done
case-insensitively (e.g. on case-insensitive file systems)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>onbranch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data that follows the keyword <strong>onbranch:</strong> is taken to be a pattern
with standard globbing wildcards and two additional ones, <strong>**/</strong> and
<strong>/**</strong>, that can match multiple path components. If we are in a worktree
where the name of the branch that is currently checked out matches the
pattern, the include condition is met.</p>
<p>
If the pattern ends with <strong>/</strong>, <strong>**</strong> will be automatically added. For
example, the pattern <strong>foo/</strong> becomes <strong>foo/**</strong>. In other words, it matches
all branches that begin with <strong>foo/</strong>. This is useful if your branches are
organized hierarchically and you would like to apply a configuration to
all the branches in that hierarchy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>hasconfig:remote.</strong>.url:*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data that follows this keyword is taken to be a pattern with
standard globbing wildcards and two additional ones, <strong>**/</strong> and <strong>/**</strong>,
that can match multiple components. The first time this keyword is seen,
the rest of the config files will be scanned for remote URLs (without
applying any values). If there exists at least one remote URL that
matches this pattern, the include condition is met.</p>
<p>
Files included by this option (directly or indirectly) are not allowed
to contain remote URLs.</p>
<p>
Note that unlike other includeIf conditions, resolving this condition
relies on information that is not yet known at the point of reading the
condition. A typical use case is this option being present as a
system-level or global-level config, and the remote URL being in a
local-level config; hence the need to scan ahead when resolving this
condition. In order to avoid the chicken-and-egg problem in which
potentially-included files can affect whether such files are potentially
included, Git breaks the cycle by prohibiting these files from affecting
the resolution of these conditions (thus, prohibiting them from
declaring remote URLs).</p>
<p>
As for the naming of this keyword, it is for forwards compatibility with
a naming scheme that supports more variable-based include conditions,
but currently Git only supports the exact keyword described above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A few more notes on matching via <strong>gitdir</strong> and <strong>gitdir/i</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Symlinks in <strong>$GIT_DIR</strong> are not resolved before matching.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Both the symlink &amp; realpath versions of paths will be matched outside of
<strong>$GIT_DIR</strong>. E.g. if ~/git is a symlink to /mnt/storage/git, both
<strong>gitdir:~/git</strong> and <strong>gitdir:/mnt/storage/git</strong> will match.</p>
<p>
This was not the case in the initial release of this feature in v2.13.0,
which only matched the realpath version. Configuration that wants to be
compatible with the initial release of this feature needs to either
specify only the realpath version, or both versions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Note that &#34;../&#34; is not special and will match literally, which is
unlikely what you want.</p>

Values
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-18" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Values of many variables are treated as a simple string, but there are
variables that take values of specific types and there are rules as to
how to spell them.</p>
<p>
boolean</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a variable is said to take a boolean value, many synonyms are
accepted for <em>true</em> and <em>false</em>; these are all case-insensitive.</p>
<p>
true</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boolean true literals are <strong>yes</strong>, <strong>on</strong>, <strong>true</strong>, and <strong>1</strong>. Also, a variable
defined without <strong>= &lt;value&gt;</strong> is taken as true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
false</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boolean false literals are <strong>no</strong>, <strong>off</strong>, <strong>false</strong>, <strong>0</strong> and the empty
string.</p>
<p>
When converting a value to its canonical form using the <strong>–type=bool</strong>
type specifier, <em>git config</em> will ensure that the output is &#34;true&#34; or
&#34;false&#34; (spelled in lowercase).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
integer</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value for many variables that specify various sizes can be suffixed
with <strong>k</strong>, <strong>M</strong>,… to mean &#34;scale the number by 1024&#34;, &#34;by 1024x1024&#34;,
etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
color</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value for a variable that takes a color is a list of colors (at most
two, one for foreground and one for background) and attributes (as many
as you want), separated by spaces.</p>
<p>
The basic colors accepted are <strong>normal</strong>, <strong>black</strong>, <strong>red</strong>, <strong>green</strong>,
<strong>yellow</strong>, <strong>blue</strong>, <strong>magenta</strong>, <strong>cyan</strong>, <strong>white</strong> and <strong>default</strong>. The first
color given is the foreground; the second is the background. All the
basic colors except <strong>normal</strong> and <strong>default</strong> have a bright variant that
can be specified by prefixing the color with <strong>bright</strong>, like <strong>brightred</strong>.</p>
<p>
The color <strong>normal</strong> makes no change to the color. It is the same as an
empty string, but can be used as the foreground color when specifying a
background color alone (for example, &#34;normal red&#34;).</p>
<p>
The color <strong>default</strong> explicitly resets the color to the terminal default,
for example to specify a cleared background. Although it varies between
terminals, this is usually not the same as setting to &#34;white black&#34;.</p>
<p>
Colors may also be given as numbers between 0 and 255; these use ANSI
256-color mode (but note that not all terminals may support this). If
your terminal supports it, you may also specify 24-bit RGB values as
hex, like <strong>#ff0ab3</strong>, or 12-bit RGB values like <strong>#f1b</strong>, which is
equivalent to the 24-bit color <strong>#ff11bb</strong>.</p>
<p>
The accepted attributes are <strong>bold</strong>, <strong>dim</strong>, <strong>ul</strong>, <strong>blink</strong>, <strong>reverse</strong>,
<strong>italic</strong>, and <strong>strike</strong> (for crossed-out or &#34;strikethrough&#34; letters). The
position of any attributes with respect to the colors (before, after, or
in between), doesn&#39;t matter. Specific attributes may be turned off by
prefixing them with <strong>no</strong> or <strong>no-</strong> (e.g., <strong>noreverse</strong>, <strong>no-ul</strong>, etc).</p>
<p>
The pseudo-attribute <strong>reset</strong> resets all colors and attributes before
applying the specified coloring. For example, <strong>reset green</strong> will result
in a green foreground and default background without any active
attributes.</p>
<p>
An empty color string produces no color effect at all. This can be used
to avoid coloring specific elements without disabling color entirely.</p>
<p>
For git&#39;s pre-defined color slots, the attributes are meant to be reset
at the beginning of each item in the colored output. So setting
<strong>color.decorate.branch</strong> to <strong>black</strong> will paint that branch name in a
plain <strong>black</strong>, even if the previous thing on the same output line (e.g.
opening parenthesis before the list of branch names in <strong>log –decorate</strong>
output) is set to be painted with <strong>bold</strong> or some other attribute.
However, custom log formats may do more complicated and layered
coloring, and the negated forms may be useful there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pathname</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A variable that takes a pathname value can be given a string that begins
with &#34;<strong>~/</strong>&#34; or &#34;<strong>~user/</strong>&#34;, and the usual tilde expansion happens to such
a string: <strong>~/</strong> is expanded to the value of <strong>$HOME</strong>, and <strong>~user/</strong> to the
specified user&#39;s home directory.</p>
<p>
If a path starts with <strong>%(prefix)/</strong>, the remainder is interpreted as a
path relative to Git&#39;s &#34;runtime prefix&#34;, i.e. relative to the location
where Git itself was installed. For example, <strong>%(prefix)/bin/</strong> refers to
the directory in which the Git executable itself lives. If Git was
compiled without runtime prefix support, the compiled-in prefix will be
substituted instead. In the unlikely event that a literal path needs to
be specified that should <em>not</em> be expanded, it needs to be prefixed by
<strong>./</strong>, like so: <strong>./%(prefix)/bin</strong>.</p>

<p>
alias.*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Command aliases for the <strong>git*(1) command wrapper - e.g. after defining
*alias.last = cat-file commit HEAD</strong>, the invocation <strong>git last</strong> is
equivalent to <strong>git cat-file commit HEAD</strong>. To avoid confusion and
troubles with script usage, aliases that hide existing Git commands are
ignored. Arguments are split by spaces, the usual shell quoting and
escaping are supported. A quote pair or a backslash can be used to quote
them.</p>
<p>
Note that the first word of an alias does not necessarily have to be a
command. It can be a command-line option that will be passed into the
invocation of <strong>git</strong>. In particular, this is useful when used with <strong>-c</strong>
to pass in one-time configurations or <strong>-p</strong> to force pagination. For
example, <strong>loud-rebase = -c commit.verbose=true rebase</strong> can be defined
such that running <strong>git loud-rebase</strong> would be equivalent to <strong>git -c
commit.verbose=true rebase</strong>. Also, <strong>ps = -p status</strong> would be a helpful
alias since <strong>git ps</strong> would paginate the output of <strong>git status</strong> where the
original command does not.</p>
<p>
If the alias expansion is prefixed with an exclamation point, it will be
treated as a shell command. For example, defining <strong>alias.new = !gitk
–all –not ORIG_HEAD</strong>, the invocation <strong>git new</strong> is equivalent to
running the shell command <strong>gitk –all –not ORIG_HEAD</strong>. Note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Shell commands will be executed from the top-level directory of a
repository, which may not necessarily be the current directory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>GIT_PREFIX</strong> is set as returned by running <strong>git rev-parse –show-prefix</strong>
from the original current directory. See *git-rev-parse*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Shell command aliases always receive any extra arguments provided to the
Git command-line as positional arguments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Care should be taken if your shell alias is a &#34;one-liner&#34; script with
multiple commands (e.g. in a pipeline), references multiple arguments,
or is otherwise not able to handle positional arguments added at the
end. For example: <strong>alias.cmd = &#34;!echo $1 | grep $2&#34;</strong> called as <strong>git cmd
1 2</strong> will be executed as <em>echo $1 | grep $2 1 2</em>, which is not what you
want.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
A convenient way to deal with this is to write your script operations in
an inline function that is then called with any arguments from the
command-line. For example `alias.cmd = &#34;!c() { echo $1 | grep $2 ; }; c&#34;
will correctly execute the prior example.</p>

<p>
bitmapPseudoMerge.&lt;name&gt;.pattern</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regular expression used to match reference names. Commits pointed to by
references matching this pattern (and meeting the below criteria, like
<strong>bitmapPseudoMerge.&lt;name&gt;.sampleRate</strong> and
<strong>bitmapPseudoMerge.&lt;name&gt;.threshold</strong>) will be considered for inclusion
in a pseudo-merge bitmap.</p>
<p>
Commits are grouped into pseudo-merge groups based on whether or not any
reference(s) that point at a given commit match the pattern, which is an
extended regular expression.</p>
<p>
Within a pseudo-merge group, commits may be further grouped into
sub-groups based on the capture groups in the pattern. These
sub-groupings are formed from the regular expressions by concatenating
any capture groups from the regular expression, with a <em>-</em> dash in
between.</p>
<p>
For example, if the pattern is <strong>refs/tags/</strong>, then all tags (provided
they meet the below criteria) will be considered candidates for the same
pseudo-merge group. However, if the pattern is instead
<strong>refs/remotes/([0-9])+/tags/</strong>, then tags from different remotes will be
grouped into separate pseudo-merge groups, based on the remote number.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
bitmapPseudoMerge.&lt;name&gt;.decay</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Determines the rate at which consecutive pseudo-merge bitmap groups
decrease in size. Must be non-negative. This parameter can be thought of
as <strong>k</strong> in the function <strong>f(n) = C * n^-k</strong>, where <strong>f(n)</strong> is the size of
the `n`th group.</p>
<p>
Setting the decay rate equal to <strong>0</strong> will cause all groups to be the same
size. Setting the decay rate equal to <strong>1</strong> will cause the <strong>n`th group to
be `1/n</strong> the size of the initial group. Higher values of the decay rate
cause consecutive groups to shrink at an increasing rate. The default is
<strong>1</strong>.</p>
<p>
If all groups are the same size, it is possible that groups containing
newer commits will be able to be used less often than earlier groups,
since it is more likely that the references pointing at newer commits
will be updated more often than a reference pointing at an old commit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
bitmapPseudoMerge.&lt;name&gt;.sampleRate</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Determines the proportion of non-bitmapped commits (among reference
tips) which are selected for inclusion in an unstable pseudo-merge
bitmap. Must be between <strong>0</strong> and <strong>1</strong> (inclusive). The default is <strong>1</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
bitmapPseudoMerge.&lt;name&gt;.threshold</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Determines the minimum age of non-bitmapped commits (among reference

<p>
bitmapPseudoMerge.&lt;name&gt;.maxMerges</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Determines the maximum number of pseudo-merge commits among which
commits may be distributed.</p>
<p>
For pseudo-merge groups whose pattern does not contain any capture
groups, this setting is applied for all commits matching the regular
expression. For patterns that have one or more capture groups, this
setting is applied for each distinct capture group.</p>
<p>
For example, if your capture group is <strong>refs/tags/</strong>, then this setting
will distribute all tags into a maximum of <strong>maxMerges</strong> pseudo-merge
commits. However, if your capture group is, say,
<strong>refs/remotes/([0-9]+)/tags/</strong>, then this setting will be applied to each
remote&#39;s set of tags individually.</p>
<p>
Must be non-negative. The default value is 64.</p>
</blockquote>

bitmapPseudoMerge.&lt;name&gt;.stableThreshold</p>
<blockquote>

however stable commits are still considered candidates even when they
have been covered by a bitmap) which are candidates for a stable a
pseudo-merge bitmap. The default is <strong>1.month.ago</strong>.</p>
<p>
Setting this threshold to a smaller value (e.g., 1.week.ago) will cause
more stable groups to be generated (which impose a one-time generation
cost) but those groups will likely become stale over time. Using a
larger value incurs the opposite penalty (fewer stable groups which are
more useful).</p>

<p>When on branch &lt;name&gt;, it overrides <strong>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</strong> for pushing.
It also overrides <strong>remote.pushDefault</strong> for pushing from branch &lt;name&gt;.
When you pull from one place (e.g. your upstream) and push to another
place (e.g. your own publishing repository), you would want to set
<strong>remote.pushDefault</strong> to specify the remote to push to for all branches,
and use this option to override it for a specific branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defines, together with branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote, the upstream branch for the
given branch. It tells <em>git fetch///git pull///git rebase</em> which branch
to merge and can also affect <em>git push</em> (see push.default). When in
branch &lt;name&gt;, it tells <em>git fetch</em> the default refspec to be marked for
merging in FETCH_HEAD. The value is handled like the remote part of a
refspec, and must match a ref which is fetched from the remote given by
&#34;branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote&#34;. The merge information is used by <em>git pull</em>
(which first calls <em>git fetch</em>) to lookup the default branch for
merging. Without this option, <em>git pull</em> defaults to merge the first
refspec fetched. Specify multiple values to get an octopus merge. If you
wish to setup <em>git pull</em> so that it merges into &lt;name&gt; from another
branch in the local repository, you can point branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge to the
desired branch, and use the relative path setting <strong>.</strong> (a period) for

checkout.defaultRemote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you run <strong>git checkout &lt;something&gt;</strong> or <strong>git switch &lt;something&gt;</strong> and
only have one remote, it may implicitly fall back on checking out and
tracking e.g. <strong>origin/&lt;something&gt;</strong>. This stops working as soon as you

allows for setting the name of a preferred remote that should always win
when it comes to disambiguation. The typical use-case is to set this to
<strong>origin</strong>.</p>

Currently this is used by <strong>git-switch*(1) and *git-checkout*(1) when
*git checkout &lt;something&gt;</strong> or <strong>git switch &lt;something&gt;</strong> will checkout the
<strong>&lt;something&gt;</strong> branch on another remote, and by <strong>git-worktree*(1) when

<blockquote>
<p>The number of parallel workers to use when updating the working tree.
The default is one, i.e. sequential execution. If set to a value less

available. This setting and <strong>checkout.thresholdForParallelism</strong> affect
all commands that perform checkout. E.g. checkout, clone, reset,
sparse-checkout, etc.</p>
<p>
Note: Parallel checkout usually delivers better performance for
repositories located on SSDs or over NFS. For repositories on spinning
disks and/or machines with a small number of cores, the default
sequential checkout often performs better. The size and compression
level of a repository might also influence how well the parallel version
performs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
checkout.thresholdForParallelism</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When running parallel checkout with a small number of files, the cost of

<p>
commit.cleanup</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This setting overrides the default of the <strong>–cleanup</strong> option in <strong>git

useful when you always want to keep lines that begin with the comment
character <strong>#</strong> in your log message, in which case you would do <strong>git
config commit.cleanup whitespace</strong> (note that you will have to remove the
help lines that begin with <strong>#</strong> in the commit log template yourself, if
you do this).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
commit.gpgSign</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean to specify whether all commits should be GPG signed. Use of
this option when doing operations such as rebase can result in a large
number of commits being signed. It may be convenient to use an agent to
avoid typing your GPG passphrase several times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
commit.status</p>

<p>
commitGraph.readChangedPaths</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
commitGraph.changedPathsVersion</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is only used by git-completion.bash to add or remove commands from
the list of completed commands. Normally only porcelain commands and a
few select others are completed. You can add more commands, separated by
space, in this variable. Prefixing the command with <em>-</em> will remove it
from the existing list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.fileMode</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tells Git if the executable bit of files in the working tree is to be
honored.</p>
<p>
Some filesystems lose the executable bit when a file that is marked as
executable is checked out, or checks out a non-executable file with
executable bit on. *git-clone*(1) or *git-init*(1) probe the filesystem
to see if it handles the executable bit correctly and this variable is
automatically set as necessary.</p>
<p>
A repository, however, may be on a filesystem that handles the filemode
correctly, and this variable is set to <em>true</em> when created, but later
may be made accessible from another environment that loses the filemode
(e.g. exporting ext4 via CIFS mount, visiting a Cygwin created
repository with Git for Windows or Eclipse). In such a case it may be
necessary to set this variable to <em>false</em>. See *git-update-index*(1).</p>
<p>
The default is true (when core.filemode is not specified in the config
file).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.hideDotFiles</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Windows-only) If true, mark newly-created directories and files whose
name starts with a dot as hidden. If <em>dotGitOnly</em>, only the <strong>.git/</strong>
directory is hidden, but no other files starting with a dot. The default
mode is <em>dotGitOnly</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.ignoreCase</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Internal variable which enables various workarounds to enable Git to
work better on filesystems that are not case sensitive, like APFS, HFS+,
FAT, NTFS, etc. For example, if a directory listing finds &#34;makefile&#34;
when Git expects &#34;Makefile&#34;, Git will assume it is really the same file,
and continue to remember it as &#34;Makefile&#34;.</p>
<p>
The default is false, except *git-clone*(1) or *git-init*(1) will probe
and set core.ignoreCase true if appropriate when the repository is
created.</p>
<p>
Git relies on the proper configuration of this variable for your
operating and file system. Modifying this value may result in unexpected
behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.precomposeUnicode</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option is only used by Mac OS implementation of Git. When
core.precomposeUnicode=true, Git reverts the unicode decomposition of
filenames done by Mac OS. This is useful when sharing a repository
between Mac OS and Linux or Windows. (Git for Windows 1.7.10 or higher
is needed, or Git under cygwin 1.7). When false, file names are handled
fully transparent by Git, which is backward compatible with older
versions of Git.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.protectHFS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to true, do not allow checkout of paths that would be considered
equivalent to <strong>.git</strong> on an HFS+ filesystem. Defaults to <strong>true</strong> on Mac
OS, and <strong>false</strong> elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.protectNTFS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to true, do not allow checkout of paths that would cause problems
with the NTFS filesystem, e.g. conflict with 8.3 &#34;short&#34; names. Defaults
to <strong>true</strong> on Windows, and <strong>false</strong> elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.fsmonitor</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to true, enable the built-in file system monitor daemon for this
working directory (*git-fsmonitor–daemon*(1)).</p>
<p>
Like hook-based file system monitors, the built-in file system monitor
can speed up Git commands that need to refresh the Git index (e.g. <strong>git
status</strong>) in a working directory with many files. The built-in monitor
eliminates the need to install and maintain an external third-party
tool.</p>
<p>
The built-in file system monitor is currently available only on a
limited set of supported platforms. Currently, this includes Windows and
MacOS.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
Otherwise, this variable contains the pathname of the &#34;fsmonitor&#34;
hook command.
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This hook command is used to identify all files that may have changed
since the requested date/time. This information is used to speed up git
by avoiding unnecessary scanning of files that have not changed.</p>
<p>
See the &#34;fsmonitor-watchman&#34; section of *githooks*(5).</p>
<p>
Note that if you concurrently use multiple versions of Git, such as one
version on the command line and another version in an IDE tool, that the
definition of <strong>core.fsmonitor</strong> was extended to allow boolean values in
addition to hook pathnames. Git versions 2.35.1 and prior will not
understand the boolean values and will consider the &#34;true&#34; or &#34;false&#34;
values as hook pathnames to be invoked. Git versions 2.26 thru 2.35.1
default to hook protocol V2 and will fall back to no fsmonitor (full
scan). Git versions prior to 2.26 default to hook protocol V1 and will
silently assume there were no changes to report (no scan), so status
commands may report incomplete results. For this reason, it is best to
upgrade all of your Git versions before using the built-in file system
monitor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.fsmonitorHookVersion</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets the protocol version to be used when invoking the &#34;fsmonitor&#34; hook.</p>
<p>
There are currently versions 1 and 2. When this is not set, version 2
will be tried first and if it fails then version 1 will be tried.
Version 1 uses a timestamp as input to determine which files have
changes since that time but some monitors like Watchman have race
conditions when used with a timestamp. Version 2 uses an opaque string
so that the monitor can return something that can be used to determine
what files have changed without race conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.trustctime</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If false, the ctime differences between the index and the working tree
are ignored; useful when the inode change time is regularly modified by
something outside Git (file system crawlers and some backup systems).
See *git-update-index*(1). True by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.splitIndex</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, the split-index feature of the index will be used. See
*git-update-index*(1). False by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.untrackedCache</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Determines what to do about the untracked cache feature of the index. It
will be kept, if this variable is unset or set to <strong>keep</strong>. It will
automatically be added if set to <strong>true</strong>. And it will automatically be
removed, if set to <strong>false</strong>. Before setting it to <strong>true</strong>, you should
check that mtime is working properly on your system. See
<strong>git-update-index*(1). *keep</strong> by default, unless <strong>feature.manyFiles</strong> is
enabled which sets this setting to <strong>true</strong> by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.checkStat</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When missing or is set to <strong>default</strong>, many fields in the stat structure
are checked to detect if a file has been modified since Git looked at
it. When this configuration variable is set to <strong>minimal</strong>, sub-second
part of mtime and ctime, the uid and gid of the owner of the file, the
inode number (and the device number, if Git was compiled to use it), are
excluded from the check among these fields, leaving only the
whole-second part of mtime (and ctime, if <strong>core.trustCtime</strong> is set) and
the filesize to be checked.</p>
<p>
There are implementations of Git that do not leave usable values in some
fields (e.g. JGit); by excluding these fields from the comparison, the
<strong>minimal</strong> mode may help interoperability when the same repository is
used by these other systems at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.quotePath</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commands that output paths (e.g. <em>ls-files</em>, <em>diff</em>), will quote
&#34;unusual&#34; characters in the pathname by enclosing the pathname in
double-quotes and escaping those characters with backslashes in the same
way C escapes control characters (e.g. <strong>\t</strong> for TAB, <strong>\n</strong> for LF, <strong>\\</strong>
for backslash) or bytes with values larger than 0x80 (e.g. octal
<strong>\302\265</strong> for &#34;micro&#34; in UTF-8). If this variable is set to false,
bytes higher than 0x80 are not considered &#34;unusual&#34; any more.
Double-quotes, backslash and control characters are always escaped
regardless of the setting of this variable. A simple space character is
not considered &#34;unusual&#34;. Many commands can output pathnames completely
verbatim using the <strong>-z</strong> option. The default value is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.eol</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets the line ending type to use in the working directory for files that
are marked as text (either by having the <strong>text</strong> attribute set, or by
having <strong>text=auto</strong> and Git auto-detecting the contents as text).
Alternatives are <em>lf</em>, <em>crlf</em> and <em>native</em>, which uses the platform&#39;s
native line ending. The default value is <strong>native</strong>. See
<strong>gitattributes*(5) for more information on end-of-line conversion. Note
that this value is ignored if *core.autocrlf</strong> is set to <strong>true</strong> or
<strong>input</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.safecrlf</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, makes Git check if converting <strong>CRLF</strong> is reversible when
end-of-line conversion is active. Git will verify if a command modifies
a file in the work tree either directly or indirectly. For example,
committing a file followed by checking out the same file should yield
the original file in the work tree. If this is not the case for the
current setting of <strong>core.autocrlf</strong>, Git will reject the file. The
variable can be set to &#34;warn&#34;, in which case Git will only warn about an
irreversible conversion but continue the operation.</p>
<p>
CRLF conversion bears a slight chance of corrupting data. When it is
enabled, Git will convert CRLF to LF during commit and LF to CRLF during
checkout. A file that contains a mixture of LF and CRLF before the
commit cannot be recreated by Git. For text files this is the right
thing to do: it corrects line endings such that we have only LF line
endings in the repository. But for binary files that are accidentally
classified as text the conversion can corrupt data.</p>
<p>
If you recognize such corruption early you can easily fix it by setting
the conversion type explicitly in .gitattributes. Right after committing
you still have the original file in your work tree and this file is not
yet corrupted. You can explicitly tell Git that this file is binary and
Git will handle the file appropriately.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the desired effect of cleaning up text files with mixed
line endings and the undesired effect of corrupting binary files cannot
be distinguished. In both cases CRLFs are removed in an irreversible
way. For text files this is the right thing to do because CRLFs are line
endings, while for binary files converting CRLFs corrupts data.</p>
<p>
Note, this safety check does not mean that a checkout will generate a
file identical to the original file for a different setting of
<strong>core.eol</strong> and <strong>core.autocrlf</strong>, but only for the current one. For
example, a text file with <strong>LF</strong> would be accepted with <strong>core.eol=lf</strong> and
could later be checked out with <strong>core.eol=crlf</strong>, in which case the
resulting file would contain <strong>CRLF</strong>, although the original file
contained <strong>LF</strong>. However, in both work trees the line endings would be
consistent, that is either all <strong>LF</strong> or all <strong>CRLF</strong>, but never mixed. A
file with mixed line endings would be reported by the <strong>core.safecrlf</strong>
mechanism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.autocrlf</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Setting this variable to &#34;true&#34; is the same as setting the <strong>text</strong>
attribute to &#34;auto&#34; on all files and core.eol to &#34;crlf&#34;. Set to true if
you want to have <strong>CRLF</strong> line endings in your working directory and the
repository has LF line endings. This variable can be set to <em>input</em>, in
which case no output conversion is performed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.checkRoundtripEncoding</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A comma and/or whitespace separated list of encodings that Git performs
UTF-8 round trip checks on if they are used in an
<strong>working-tree-encoding</strong> attribute (see <strong>gitattributes*(5)). The default
value is *SHIFT-JIS</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.symlinks</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If false, symbolic links are checked out as small plain files that
contain the link text. *git-update-index*(1) and *git-add*(1) will not
change the recorded type to regular file. Useful on filesystems like FAT
that do not support symbolic links.</p>
<p>
The default is true, except *git-clone*(1) or *git-init*(1) will probe
and set core.symlinks false if appropriate when the repository is
created.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.gitProxy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A &#34;proxy command&#34; to execute (as <em>command host port</em>) instead of
establishing direct connection to the remote server when using the Git
protocol for fetching. If the variable value is in the &#34;COMMAND for
DOMAIN&#34; format, the command is applied only on hostnames ending with the
specified domain string. This variable may be set multiple times and is
matched in the given order; the first match wins.</p>
<p>
Can be overridden by the <strong>GIT_PROXY_COMMAND</strong> environment variable (which
always applies universally, without the special &#34;for&#34; handling).</p>
<p>
The special string <strong>none</strong> can be used as the proxy command to specify
that no proxy be used for a given domain pattern. This is useful for
excluding servers inside a firewall from proxy use, while defaulting to
a common proxy for external domains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.sshCommand</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this variable is set, <strong>git fetch</strong> and <strong>git push</strong> will use the
specified command instead of <strong>ssh</strong> when they need to connect to a remote
system. The command is in the same form as the <strong>GIT_SSH_COMMAND</strong>
environment variable and is overridden when the environment variable is
set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.ignoreStat</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, Git will avoid using lstat() calls to detect if files have
changed by setting the &#34;assume-unchanged&#34; bit for those tracked files
which it has updated identically in both the index and working tree.</p>
<p>
When files are modified outside of Git, the user will need to stage the
modified files explicitly (e.g. see <em>Examples</em> section in
*git-update-index*(1)). Git will not normally detect changes to those
files.</p>
<p>
This is useful on systems where lstat() calls are very slow, such as
CIFS/Microsoft Windows.</p>
<p>
False by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.preferSymlinkRefs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of the default &#34;symref&#34; format for HEAD and other symbolic
reference files, use symbolic links. This is sometimes needed to work
with old scripts that expect HEAD to be a symbolic link.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.alternateRefsCommand</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When advertising tips of available history from an alternate, use the
shell to execute the specified command instead of *git-for-each-ref*(1).
The first argument is the absolute path of the alternate. Output must
contain one hex object id per line (i.e., the same as produced by <strong>git
for-each-ref –format=%(objectname)</strong>).</p>
<p>
Note that you cannot generally put <strong>git for-each-ref</strong> directly into the
config value, as it does not take a repository path as an argument (but
you can wrap the command above in a shell script).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.alternateRefsPrefixes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When listing references from an alternate, list only references that
begin with the given prefix. Prefixes match as if they were given as
arguments to <strong>git-for-each-ref*(1). To list multiple prefixes, separate
them with whitespace. If *core.alternateRefsCommand</strong> is set, setting
<strong>core.alternateRefsPrefixes</strong> has no effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.bare</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true this repository is assumed to be <em>bare</em> and has no working
directory associated with it. If this is the case a number of commands
that require a working directory will be disabled, such as *git-add*(1)
or *git-merge*(1).</p>
<p>
This setting is automatically guessed by *git-clone*(1) or *git-init*(1)
when the repository was created. By default a repository that ends in
&#34;/.git&#34; is assumed to be not bare (bare = false), while all other
repositories are assumed to be bare (bare = true).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.worktree</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the path to the root of the working tree. If <strong>GIT_COMMON_DIR</strong>
environment variable is set, core.worktree is ignored and not used for
determining the root of working tree. This can be overridden by the
<strong>GIT_WORK_TREE</strong> environment variable and the <strong>–work-tree</strong> command-line
option. The value can be an absolute path or relative to the path to the
.git directory, which is either specified by –git-dir or GIT_DIR, or
automatically discovered. If –git-dir or GIT_DIR is specified but none
of –work-tree, GIT_WORK_TREE and core.worktree is specified, the
current working directory is regarded as the top level of your working
tree.</p>
<p>
Note that this variable is honored even when set in a configuration file
in a &#34;.git&#34; subdirectory of a directory and its value differs from the
latter directory (e.g. &#34;<em>path/to</em>.git/config&#34; has core.worktree set to
&#34;/different/path&#34;), which is most likely a misconfiguration. Running Git
commands in the &#34;/path/to&#34; directory will still use &#34;/different/path&#34; as
the root of the work tree and can cause confusion unless you know what
you are doing (e.g. you are creating a read-only snapshot of the same
index to a location different from the repository&#39;s usual working tree).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.logAllRefUpdates</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable the reflog. Updates to a ref &lt;ref&gt; is logged to the file
&#34;<strong>$GIT_DIR/logs/&lt;ref&gt;</strong>&#34;, by appending the new and old SHA-1, the
date/time and the reason of the update, but only when the file exists.
If this configuration variable is set to <strong>true</strong>, missing
&#34;<strong>$GIT_DIR/logs/&lt;ref&gt;</strong>&#34; file is automatically created for branch heads
(i.e. under <strong>refs/heads/</strong>), remote refs (i.e. under <strong>refs/remotes/</strong>),
note refs (i.e. under <strong>refs/notes/</strong>), and the symbolic ref <strong>HEAD</strong>. If it
is set to <strong>always</strong>, then a missing reflog is automatically created for
any ref under <strong>refs/</strong>.</p>
<p>
This information can be used to determine what commit was the tip of a
branch &#34;2 days ago&#34;.</p>
<p>
This value is true by default in a repository that has a working
directory associated with it, and false by default in a bare repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.repositoryFormatVersion</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Internal variable identifying the repository format and layout version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.sharedRepository</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <em>group</em> (or <em>true</em>), the repository is made shareable between
several users in a group (making sure all the files and objects are
group-writable). When <em>all</em> (or <em>world</em> or <em>everybody</em>), the repository
will be readable by all users, additionally to being group-shareable.
When <em>umask</em> (or <em>false</em>), Git will use permissions reported by
umask(2). When <em>0xxx</em>, where <em>0xxx</em> is an octal number, files in the
repository will have this mode value. <em>0xxx</em> will override user&#39;s umask
value (whereas the other options will only override requested parts of
the user&#39;s umask value). Examples: <em>0660</em> will make the repo
read/write-able for the owner and group, but inaccessible to others
(equivalent to <em>group</em> unless umask is e.g. <em>0022</em>). <em>0640</em> is a
repository that is group-readable but not group-writable. See
*git-init*(1). False by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.warnAmbiguousRefs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, Git will warn you if the ref name you passed it is ambiguous
and might match multiple refs in the repository. True by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.compression</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An integer -1..9, indicating a default compression level. -1 is the zlib
default. 0 means no compression, and 1..9 are various speed/size
tradeoffs, 9 being slowest. If set, this provides a default to other
compression variables, such as <strong>core.looseCompression</strong> and
<strong>pack.compression</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.looseCompression</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An integer -1..9, indicating the compression level for objects that are
not in a pack file. -1 is the zlib default. 0 means no compression, and
1..9 are various speed/size tradeoffs, 9 being slowest. If not set,
defaults to core.compression. If that is not set, defaults to 1 (best
speed).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.packedGitWindowSize</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Number of bytes of a pack file to map into memory in a single mapping
operation. Larger window sizes may allow your system to process a
smaller number of large pack files more quickly. Smaller window sizes
will negatively affect performance due to increased calls to the
operating system&#39;s memory manager, but may improve performance when
accessing a large number of large pack files.</p>
<p>
Default is 1 MiB if NO_MMAP was set at compile time, otherwise 32 MiB on
32 bit platforms and 1 GiB on 64 bit platforms. This should be
reasonable for all users/operating systems. You probably do not need to
adjust this value.</p>
<p>
Common unit suffixes of <em>k</em>, <em>m</em>, or <em>g</em> are supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.packedGitLimit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maximum number of bytes to map simultaneously into memory from pack
files. If Git needs to access more than this many bytes at once to
complete an operation it will unmap existing regions to reclaim virtual
address space within the process.</p>
<p>
Default is 256 MiB on 32 bit platforms and 32 TiB (effectively
unlimited) on 64 bit platforms. This should be reasonable for all
users/operating systems, except on the largest projects. You probably do
not need to adjust this value.</p>
<p>
Common unit suffixes of <em>k</em>, <em>m</em>, or <em>g</em> are supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.deltaBaseCacheLimit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maximum number of bytes per thread to reserve for caching base objects
that may be referenced by multiple deltified objects. By storing the
entire decompressed base objects in a cache Git is able to avoid
unpacking and decompressing frequently used base objects multiple times.</p>
<p>
Default is 96 MiB on all platforms. This should be reasonable for all
users/operating systems, except on the largest projects. You probably do
not need to adjust this value.</p>
<p>
Common unit suffixes of <em>k</em>, <em>m</em>, or <em>g</em> are supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.bigFileThreshold</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The size of files considered &#34;big&#34;, which as discussed below changes the
behavior of numerous git commands, as well as how such files are stored
within the repository. The default is 512 MiB. Common unit suffixes of
<em>k</em>, <em>m</em>, or <em>g</em> are supported.</p>
<p>
Files above the configured limit will be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Stored deflated in packfiles, without attempting delta compression.</p>
<p>
The default limit is primarily set with this use-case in mind. With it,
most projects will have their source code and other text files delta
compressed, but not larger binary media files.</p>
<p>
Storing large files without delta compression avoids excessive memory
usage, at the slight expense of increased disk usage.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Will be treated as if they were labeled &#34;binary&#34; (see
*gitattributes*(5)). e.g. *git-log*(1) and *git-diff*(1) will not
compute diffs for files above this limit.</p>

*git-index-pack*(1), *git-unpack-objects*(1) and *git-fsck*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.excludesFile</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the pathname to the file that contains patterns to describe
paths that are not meant to be tracked, in addition to <strong>.gitignore</strong>
(per-directory) and <strong>.git/info/exclude</strong>. Defaults to
<strong>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore</strong>. If <strong>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</strong> is either not set

<p>
core.askPass</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some commands (e.g. svn and http interfaces) that interactively ask for
a password can be told to use an external program given via the value of
this variable. Can be overridden by the <strong>GIT_ASKPASS</strong> environment
variable. If not set, fall back to the value of the <strong>SSH_ASKPASS</strong>
environment variable or, failing that, a simple password prompt. The
external program shall be given a suitable prompt as command-line
argument and write the password on its STDOUT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.attributesFile</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to <strong>.gitattributes</strong> (per-directory) and
<strong>.git/info/attributes</strong>, Git looks into this file for attributes (see
<strong>gitattributes*(5)). Path expansions are made the same way as for
*core.excludesFile</strong>. Its default value is
<strong>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/attributes</strong>. If <strong>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</strong> is either not
set or empty, <strong>$HOME/.config/git/attributes</strong> is used instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.hooksPath</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default Git will look for your hooks in the <strong>$GIT_DIR/hooks</strong>
directory. Set this to different path, e.g. <strong>/etc/git/hooks</strong>, and Git
will try to find your hooks in that directory, e.g.
<strong>/etc/git/hooks/pre-receive</strong> instead of in <strong>$GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-receive</strong>.</p>
<p>
The path can be either absolute or relative. A relative path is taken as
relative to the directory where the hooks are run (see the &#34;DESCRIPTION&#34;
section of *githooks*(5)).</p>
<p>
This configuration variable is useful in cases where you&#39;d like to
centrally configure your Git hooks instead of configuring them on a
per-repository basis, or as a more flexible and centralized alternative
to having an <strong>init.templateDir</strong> where you&#39;ve changed default hooks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.editor</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commands such as <strong>commit</strong> and <strong>tag</strong> that let you edit messages by
launching an editor use the value of this variable when it is set, and
the environment variable <strong>GIT_EDITOR</strong> is not set. See *git-var*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.commentChar, core.commentString</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commands such as <strong>commit</strong> and <strong>tag</strong> that let you edit messages consider
a line that begins with this character commented, and removes them after
the editor returns (default <em>#</em>).</p>
<p>
If set to &#34;auto&#34;, <strong>git-commit</strong> would select a character that is not the
beginning character of any line in existing commit messages.</p>
<p>
Note that these two variables are aliases of each other, and in modern
versions of Git you are free to use a string (e.g., <strong>//</strong> or <strong>⁑⁕⁑</strong>) with
<strong>commentChar</strong>. Versions of Git prior to v2.45.0 will ignore
<strong>commentString</strong> but will reject a value of <strong>commentChar</strong> that consists
of more than a single ASCII byte. If you plan to use your config with
older and newer versions of Git, you may want to specify both:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
[core]
# single character for older versions
commentChar = &#34;#&#34;
# string for newer versions (which will override commentChar
# because it comes later in the file)
commentString = &#34;//&#34;
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.filesRefLockTimeout</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The length of time, in milliseconds, to retry when trying to lock an
individual reference. Value 0 means not to retry at all; -1 means to try
indefinitely. Default is 100 (i.e., retry for 100ms).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.packedRefsTimeout</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The length of time, in milliseconds, to retry when trying to lock the
<strong>packed-refs</strong> file. Value 0 means not to retry at all; -1 means to try
indefinitely. Default is 1000 (i.e., retry for 1 second).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.pager</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text viewer for use by Git commands (e.g., <em>less</em>). The value is meant
to be interpreted by the shell. The order of preference is the
<strong>$GIT_PAGER</strong> environment variable, then <strong>core.pager</strong> configuration, then
<strong>$PAGER</strong>, and then the default chosen at compile time (usually <em>less</em>).</p>
<p>
When the <strong>LESS</strong> environment variable is unset, Git sets it to <strong>FRX</strong> (if
<strong>LESS</strong> environment variable is set, Git does not change it at all). If
you want to selectively override Git&#39;s default setting for <strong>LESS</strong>, you
can set <strong>core.pager</strong> to e.g. <strong>less -S</strong>. This will be passed to the shell
by Git, which will translate the final command to <strong>LESS=FRX less -S</strong>.
The environment does not set the <strong>S</strong> option but the command line does,
instructing less to truncate long lines. Similarly, setting <strong>core.pager</strong>
to <strong>less -+F</strong> will deactivate the <strong>F</strong> option specified by the
environment from the command-line, deactivating the &#34;quit if one screen&#34;
behavior of <strong>less</strong>. One can specifically activate some flags for
particular commands: for example, setting <strong>pager.blame</strong> to <strong>less -S</strong>
enables line truncation only for <strong>git blame</strong>.</p>
<p>
Likewise, when the <strong>LV</strong> environment variable is unset, Git sets it to
<strong>-c</strong>. You can override this setting by exporting <strong>LV</strong> with another value
or setting <strong>core.pager</strong> to <strong>lv +c</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.whitespace</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A comma separated list of common whitespace problems to notice. <em>git
diff</em> will use <strong>color.diff.whitespace</strong> to highlight them, and <em>git apply
–whitespace=error</em> will consider them as errors. You can prefix <strong>-</strong> to
disable any of them (e.g. <strong>-trailing-space</strong>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>blank-at-eol</strong> treats trailing whitespaces at the end of the line as an
error (enabled by default).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>

<strong>space-before-tab</strong> treats a space character that appears immediately
before a tab character in the initial indent part of the line as an
error (enabled by default).</p>

<strong>indent-with-non-tab</strong> treats a line that is indented with space
characters instead of the equivalent tabs as an error (not enabled by

<strong>blank-at-eof</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>cr-at-eol</strong> treats a carriage-return at the end of line as part of the
line terminator, i.e. with it, <strong>trailing-space</strong> does not trigger if the
character before such a carriage-return is not a whitespace (not enabled
by default).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>tabwidth=&lt;n&gt;</strong> tells how many character positions a tab occupies; this
is relevant for <strong>indent-with-non-tab</strong> and when Git fixes <strong>tab-in-indent</strong>
errors. The default tab width is 8. Allowed values are 1 to 63.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.fsync</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A comma-separated list of components of the repository that should be
hardened via the core.fsyncMethod when created or modified. You can
disable hardening of any component by prefixing it with a <em>-</em>. Items
that are not hardened may be lost in the event of an unclean system
shutdown. Unless you have special requirements, it is recommended that
you leave this option empty or pick one of <strong>committed</strong>, <strong>added</strong>, or
<strong>all</strong>.</p>
<p>
When this configuration is encountered, the set of components starts
with the platform default value, disabled components are removed, and
additional components are added. <strong>none</strong> resets the state so that the
platform default is ignored.</p>
<p>
The empty string resets the fsync configuration to the platform default.
The default on most platforms is equivalent to
<strong>core.fsync=committed,-loose-object</strong>, which has good performance, but
risks losing recent work in the event of an unclean system shutdown.</p>

<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>batch</strong> enables a mode that uses writeout-only flushes to stage multiple
updates in the disk writeback cache and then does a single full fsync of
a dummy file to trigger the disk cache flush at the end of the
operation.</p>
<p>
Currently <strong>batch</strong> mode only applies to loose-object files. Other
repository data is made durable as if <strong>fsync</strong> was specified. This mode
is expected to be as safe as <strong>fsync</strong> on macOS for repos stored on HFS+
or APFS filesystems and on Windows for repos stored on NTFS or ReFS
filesystems.</p>

<p>
core.fsyncObjectFiles</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This boolean will enable <em>fsync()</em> when writing object files. This
setting is deprecated. Use core.fsync instead.</p>
<p>
This setting affects data added to the Git repository in loose-object

to flush caches so that loose-objects remain consistent in the face of a
unclean system shutdown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.preloadIndex</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable parallel index preload for operations like <em>git diff</em></p>
<p>
This can speed up operations like <em>git diff</em> and <em>git status</em> especially
on filesystems like NFS that have weak caching semantics and thus
relatively high IO latencies. When enabled, Git will do the index
comparison to the filesystem data in parallel, allowing overlapping
IO&#39;s. Defaults to true.</p>

<p>
core.unsetenvvars</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Windows-only: comma-separated list of environment variables names that

<p>You can set this to <em>link</em>, in which case a hardlink followed by a
delete of the source are used to make sure that object creation will not
overwrite existing objects.</p>
<p>
On some file system/operating system combinations, this is unreliable.
Set this config setting to <em>rename</em> there; however, this will remove the
check that makes sure that existing object files will not get
overwritten.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.notesRef</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When showing commit messages, also show notes which are stored in the
given ref. The ref must be fully qualified. If the given ref does not
exist, it is not an error but means that no notes should be printed.</p>
<p>
This setting defaults to &#34;refs/notes/commits&#34;, and it can be overridden
by the <strong>GIT_NOTES_REF</strong> environment variable. See *git-notes*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.commitGraph</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, then git will read the commit-graph file (if it exists) to
parse the graph structure of commits. Defaults to true. See
*git-commit-graph*(1) for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.useReplaceRefs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to <strong>false</strong>, behave as if the <strong>–no-replace-objects</strong> option was
given on the command line. See *git*(1) and *git-replace*(1) for more
information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.multiPackIndex</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the multi-pack-index file to track multiple packfiles using a single
index. See *git-multi-pack-index*(1) for more information. Defaults to
true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.sparseCheckout</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable &#34;sparse checkout&#34; feature. See *git-sparse-checkout*(1) for more
information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.sparseCheckoutCone</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enables the &#34;cone mode&#34; of the sparse checkout feature. When the
sparse-checkout file contains a limited set of patterns, this mode
provides significant performance advantages. The &#34;non-cone mode&#34; can be
requested to allow specifying more flexible patterns by setting this
variable to <em>false</em>. See *git-sparse-checkout*(1) for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.abbrev</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the length object names are abbreviated to. If unspecified or set to
&#34;auto&#34;, an appropriate value is computed based on the approximate number
of packed objects in your repository, which hopefully is enough for
abbreviated object names to stay unique for some time. If set to &#34;no&#34;,
no abbreviation is made and the object names are shown in their full
length. The minimum length is 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
core.maxTreeDepth</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The maximum depth Git is willing to recurse while traversing a tree
(e.g., &#34;a/b/cde/f&#34; has a depth of 4). This is a fail-safe to allow Git
to abort cleanly, and should not generally need to be adjusted. When Git
is compiled with MSVC, the default is 512. Otherwise, the default
is 2048.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
credential.helper</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify an external helper to be called when a username or password
credential is needed; the helper may consult external storage to avoid
prompting the user for the credentials. This is normally the name of a
credential helper with possible arguments, but may also be an absolute
path with arguments or, if preceded by <strong>!</strong>, shell commands.</p>
<p>
Note that multiple helpers may be defined. See *gitcredentials*(7) for
details and examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
credential.useHttpPath</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When acquiring credentials, consider the &#34;path&#34; component of an http or
https URL to be important. Defaults to false. See *gitcredentials*(7)
for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
credential.username</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If no username is set for a network authentication, use this username by
default. See credential.&lt;context&gt;.* below, and *gitcredentials*(7).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
credential.&lt;url&gt;.*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any of the credential.* options above can be applied selectively to some
credentials. For example, &#34;credential.<a href="https://example.com.username">https://example.com.username</a>&#34;
would set the default username only for https connections to
example.com. See *gitcredentials*(7) for details on how URLs are
matched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
credentialCache.ignoreSIGHUP</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell git-credential-cache—daemon to ignore SIGHUP, instead of
quitting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
credentialStore.lockTimeoutMS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The length of time, in milliseconds, for git-credential-store to retry
when trying to lock the credentials file. A value of 0 means not to
retry at all; -1 means to try indefinitely. Default is 1000 (i.e., retry
for 1s).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.autoRefreshIndex</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When using <em>git diff</em> to compare with work tree files, do not consider
stat-only changes as changed. Instead, silently run <strong>git update-index
–refresh</strong> to update the cached stat information for paths whose
contents in the work tree match the contents in the index. This option
defaults to true. Note that this affects only <em>git diff</em> Porcelain, and
not lower level <em>diff</em> commands such as <em>git diff-files</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.dirstat</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A comma separated list of <strong>–dirstat</strong> parameters specifying the default
behavior of the <strong>–dirstat</strong> option to *git-diff*(1) and friends. The
defaults can be overridden on the command line (using
<strong>–dirstat=&lt;param1,param2,…&gt;</strong>). The fallback defaults (when not
changed by <strong>diff.dirstat</strong>) are <strong>changes,noncumulative,3</strong>. The following
parameters are available:</p>
<p>
<strong>changes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have been removed
from the source, or added to the destination. This ignores the amount of
pure code movements within a file. In other words, rearranging lines in
a file is not counted as much as other changes. This is the default
behavior when no parameter is given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>lines</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line-based diff
analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts. (For binary files,
count 64-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no natural concept
of lines). This is a more expensive <strong>–dirstat</strong> behavior than the
<strong>changes</strong> behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a file as
much as other changes. The resulting output is consistent with what you
get from the other <strong>–*stat</strong> options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>files</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files changed.
Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis. This is the
computationally cheapest <strong>–dirstat</strong> behavior, since it does not have to
look at the file contents at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>cumulative</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory as well.
Note that when using <strong>cumulative</strong>, the sum of the percentages reported
may exceed 100%. The default (non-cumulative) behavior can be specified
with the <strong>noncumulative</strong> parameter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;limit&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by default).
Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes are
not shown in the output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring
directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and
accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
<strong>files,10,cumulative</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.statNameWidth</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the width of the filename part in –stat output. If set, applies
to all commands generating –stat output except format-patch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.statGraphWidth</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the width of the graph part in –stat output. If set, applies to
all commands generating –stat output except format-patch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.context</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generate diffs with &lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of the default of 3.
This value is overridden by the -U option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.interHunkContext</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified number of
lines, thereby fusing the hunks that are close to each other. This value
serves as the default for the <strong>–inter-hunk-context</strong> command line
option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.external</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this config variable is set, diff generation is not performed using
the internal diff machinery, but using the given command. Can be
overridden with the ‘GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF&#39; environment variable. The
command is called with parameters as described under &#34;git Diffs&#34; in
*git*(1). Note: if you want to use an external diff program only on a
subset of your files, you might want to use *gitattributes*(5) instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.trustExitCode</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this boolean value is set to true then the <strong>diff.external</strong> command is
expected to return exit code 0 if it considers the input files to be
equal or 1 if it considers them to be different, like <strong>diff(1)</strong>. If it
is set to false, which is the default, then the command is expected to
return exit code 0 regardless of equality. Any other exit code causes
Git to report a fatal error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.ignoreSubmodules</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sets the default value of –ignore-submodules. Note that this affects
only <em>git diff</em> Porcelain, and not lower level <em>diff</em> commands such as
<em>git diff-files</em>. <em>git checkout</em> and <em>git switch</em> also honor this
setting when reporting uncommitted changes. Setting it to <em>all</em> disables
the submodule summary normally shown by <em>git commit</em> and <em>git status</em>
when <strong>status.submoduleSummary</strong> is set unless it is overridden by using
the –ignore-submodules command-line option. The <em>git submodule</em>
commands are not affected by this setting. By default this is set to
untracked so that any untracked submodules are ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.mnemonicPrefix</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set, <em>git diff</em> uses a prefix pair that is different from the
standard &#34;a/&#34; and &#34;b/&#34; depending on what is being compared. When this
configuration is in effect, reverse diff output also swaps the order of
the prefixes:</p>
<p>
<strong>git diff</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>compares the (i)ndex and the (w)ork tree;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>git diff HEAD</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>compares a (c)ommit and the (w)ork tree;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>git diff –cached</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>compares a (c)ommit and the (i)ndex;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>git diff HEAD:file1 file2</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>compares an (o)bject and a (w)ork tree entity;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>git diff –no-index a b</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>compares two non-git things (1) and (2).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.noPrefix</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set, <em>git diff</em> does not show any source or destination prefix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.srcPrefix</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set, <em>git diff</em> uses this source prefix. Defaults to &#34;a/&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.dstPrefix</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set, <em>git diff</em> uses this destination prefix. Defaults to &#34;b/&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.relative</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to <em>true</em>, <em>git diff</em> does not show changes outside of the
directory and show pathnames relative to the current directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.orderFile</p>
<blockquote>
<p>File indicating how to order files within a diff. See the <em>-O</em> option to
<strong>git-diff*(1) for details. If *diff.orderFile</strong> is a relative pathname,
it is treated as relative to the top of the working tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.renameLimit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of files to consider in the exhaustive portion of copy/rename
detection; equivalent to the <em>git diff</em> option <strong>-l</strong>. If not set, the
default value is currently 1000. This setting has no effect if rename
detection is turned off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.renames</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether and how Git detects renames. If set to &#34;false&#34;, rename detection
is disabled. If set to &#34;true&#34;, basic rename detection is enabled. If set
to &#34;copies&#34; or &#34;copy&#34;, Git will detect copies, as well. Defaults to
true. Note that this affects only <em>git diff</em> Porcelain like
*git-diff*(1) and *git-log*(1), and not lower level commands such as
*git-diff-files*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.suppressBlankEmpty</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean to inhibit the standard behavior of printing a space before
each empty output line. Defaults to false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.submodule</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the format in which differences in submodules are shown. The
&#34;short&#34; format just shows the names of the commits at the beginning and
end of the range. The &#34;log&#34; format lists the commits in the range like
<strong>git-submodule*(1) *summary</strong> does. The &#34;diff&#34; format shows an inline
diff of the changed contents of the submodule. Defaults to &#34;short&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.wordRegex</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A POSIX Extended Regular Expression used to determine what is a &#34;word&#34;
when performing word-by-word difference calculations. Character
sequences that match the regular expression are &#34;words&#34;, all other
characters are <strong>ignorable</strong> whitespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.&lt;driver&gt;.command</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The custom diff driver command. See *gitattributes*(5) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.&lt;driver&gt;.trustExitCode</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this boolean value is set to true then the <strong>diff.&lt;driver&gt;.command</strong>
command is expected to return exit code 0 if it considers the input
files to be equal or 1 if it considers them to be different, like
<strong>diff(1)</strong>. If it is set to false, which is the default, then the command
is expected to return exit code 0 regardless of equality. Any other exit
code causes Git to report a fatal error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.&lt;driver&gt;.xfuncname</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The regular expression that the diff driver should use to recognize the
hunk header. A built-in pattern may also be used. See *gitattributes*(5)
for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.&lt;driver&gt;.binary</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set this option to true to make the diff driver treat files as binary.
See *gitattributes*(5) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.&lt;driver&gt;.textconv</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The command that the diff driver should call to generate the
text-converted version of a file. The result of the conversion is used
to generate a human-readable diff. See *gitattributes*(5) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.&lt;driver&gt;.wordRegex</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The regular expression that the diff driver should use to split words in
a line. See *gitattributes*(5) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
diff.&lt;driver&gt;.cachetextconv</p>
<blockquote>

diff.colorMoved</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to either a valid <strong>&lt;mode&gt;</strong> or a true value, moved lines in a diff
are colored differently, for details of valid modes see <em>–color-moved</em>
in *git-diff*(1). If simply set to true the default color mode will be

<p>
Note that this setting should only be set by *git-init*(1) or

and will produce hard-to-diagnose issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
extensions.compatObjectFormat</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify a compatitbility hash algorithm to use. The acceptable values
are <strong>sha1</strong> and <strong>sha256</strong>. The value specified must be different from the
value of extensions.objectFormat. This allows client level
interoperability between git repositories whose objectFormat matches
this compatObjectFormat. In particular when fully implemented the pushes
and pulls from a repository in whose objectFormat matches
compatObjectFormat. As well as being able to use oids encoded in
compatObjectFormat in addition to oids encoded with objectFormat to

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
extensions.worktreeConfig</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If enabled, then worktrees will load config settings from the
<strong>$GIT_DIR/config.worktree</strong> file in addition to the
<strong>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config</strong> file. Note that <strong>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</strong> and
<strong>$GIT_DIR</strong> are the same for the main working tree, while other working
trees have <strong>$GIT_DIR</strong> equal to <strong>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/</strong>. The
settings in the <strong>config.worktree</strong> file will override settings from any
other config files.</p>
<p>
When enabling <strong>extensions.worktreeConfig</strong>, you must be careful to move
certain values from the common config file to the main working tree&#39;s
<strong>config.worktree</strong> file, if present:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>core.worktree</strong> must be moved from <strong>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config</strong> to
<strong>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config.worktree</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
If <strong>core.bare</strong> is true, then it must be moved from
<strong>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config</strong> to <strong>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config.worktree</strong>.</p>
<p>
It may also be beneficial to adjust the locations of
<strong>core.sparseCheckout</strong> and <strong>core.sparseCheckoutCone</strong> depending on your
desire for customizable sparse-checkout settings for each worktree. By
default, the <strong>git sparse-checkout</strong> builtin enables
<strong>extensions.worktreeConfig</strong>, assigns these config values on a
per-worktree basis, and uses the <strong>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</strong> file to
specify the sparsity for each worktree independently. See
*git-sparse-checkout*(1) for more details.</p>
<p>
For historical reasons, <strong>extensions.worktreeConfig</strong> is respected
regardless of the <strong>core.repositoryFormatVersion</strong> setting.</p>

fastimport.unpackLimit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the number of objects imported by *git-fast-import*(1) is below this

feature.manyFiles</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable config options that optimize for repos with many files in the

<p>
fetch.recurseSubmodules</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option controls whether <strong>git fetch</strong> (and the underlying fetch in
<strong>git pull</strong>) will recursively fetch into populated submodules. This
option can be set either to a boolean value or to <em>on-demand</em>. Setting
it to a boolean changes the behavior of fetch and pull to recurse
unconditionally into submodules when set to true or to not recurse at
all when set to false. When set to <em>on-demand</em>, fetch and pull will only
recurse into a populated submodule when its superproject retrieves a
commit that updates the submodule&#39;s reference. Defaults to <em>on-demand</em>,
or to the value of <em>submodule.recurse</em> if set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
fetch.fsckObjects</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it is set to true, git-fetch-pack will check all fetched objects. See
<strong>transfer.fsckObjects</strong> for what&#39;s checked. Defaults to false. If not
set, the value of <strong>transfer.fsckObjects</strong> is used instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Acts like <strong>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</strong>, but is used by <strong>git-fetch-pack*(1) instead of

</blockquote>
<p>
fetch.unpackLimit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the number of objects fetched over the Git native transfer is below
this limit, then the objects will be unpacked into loose object files.
However if the number of received objects equals or exceeds this limit
then the received pack will be stored as a pack, after adding any
missing delta bases. Storing the pack from a push can make the push
operation complete faster, especially on slow filesystems. If not set,
the value of <strong>transfer.unpackLimit</strong> is used instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
fetch.prune</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, fetch will automatically behave as if the <strong>–prune</strong> option was
given on the command line. See also <strong>remote.&lt;name&gt;.prune</strong> and the
PRUNING section of *git-fetch*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
fetch.pruneTags</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, fetch will automatically behave as if the
<strong>refs/tags/</strong>:refs/tags/** refspec was provided when pruning, if not set
already. This allows for setting both this option and <strong>fetch.prune</strong> to
maintain a 1=1 mapping to upstream refs. See also
<strong>remote.&lt;name&gt;.pruneTags</strong> and the PRUNING section of *git-fetch*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
fetch.all</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, fetch will attempt to update all available remotes. This
behavior can be overridden by passing <strong>–no-all</strong> or by explicitly
specifying one or more remote(s) to fetch from. Defaults to false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
fetch.output</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Control how ref update status is printed. Valid values are <strong>full</strong> and
<strong>compact</strong>. Default value is <strong>full</strong>. See the OUTPUT section in
*git-fetch*(1) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
fetch.negotiationAlgorithm</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Control how information about the commits in the local repository is
sent when negotiating the contents of the packfile to be sent by the
server. Set to &#34;consecutive&#34; to use an algorithm that walks over
consecutive commits checking each one. Set to &#34;skipping&#34; to use an
algorithm that skips commits in an effort to converge faster, but may
result in a larger-than-necessary packfile; or set to &#34;noop&#34; to not send
any information at all, which will almost certainly result in a
larger-than-necessary packfile, but will skip the negotiation step. Set
to &#34;default&#34; to override settings made previously and use the default
behaviour. The default is normally &#34;consecutive&#34;, but if
<strong>feature.experimental</strong> is true, then the default is &#34;skipping&#34;. Unknown
values will cause <em>git fetch</em> to error out.</p>

fetch.parallel</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the maximal number of fetch operations to be run in parallel
at a time (submodules, or remotes when the <strong>–multiple</strong> option of
*git-fetch*(1) is in effect).</p>
<p>
A value of 0 will give some reasonable default. If unset, it defaults
to 1.</p>
<p>
For submodules, this setting can be overridden using the
<strong>submodule.fetchJobs</strong> config setting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
fetch.writeCommitGraph</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set to true to write a commit-graph after every <strong>git fetch</strong> command that
downloads a pack-file from a remote. Using the <strong>–split</strong> option, most
executions will create a very small commit-graph file on top of the
existing commit-graph file(s). Occasionally, these files will merge and
the write may take longer. Having an updated commit-graph file helps
performance of many Git commands, including <strong>git merge-base</strong>, <strong>git push
-f</strong>, and <strong>git log –graph</strong>. Defaults to false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
fetch.bundleURI</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This value stores a URI for downloading Git object data from a bundle
URI before performing an incremental fetch from the origin Git server.
This is similar to how the <strong>–bundle-uri</strong> option behaves in
<strong>git-clone*(1). *git clone –bundle-uri</strong> will set the <strong>fetch.bundleURI</strong>
value if the supplied bundle URI contains a bundle list that is
organized for incremental fetches.</p>
<p>
If you modify this value and your repository has a
<strong>fetch.bundleCreationToken</strong> value, then remove that
<strong>fetch.bundleCreationToken</strong> value before fetching from the new bundle
URI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
fetch.bundleCreationToken</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When using <strong>fetch.bundleURI</strong> to fetch incrementally from a bundle list
that uses the &#34;creationToken&#34; heuristic, this config value stores the
maximum <strong>creationToken</strong> value of the downloaded bundles. This value is
used to prevent downloading bundles in the future if the advertised
<strong>creationToken</strong> is not strictly larger than this value.</p>
<p>
The creation token values are chosen by the provider serving the
specific bundle URI. If you modify the URI at <strong>fetch.bundleURI</strong>, then be
sure to remove the value for the <strong>fetch.bundleCreationToken</strong> value
before fetching.</p>

value, set it to an empty string.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
format.from</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provides the default value for the <strong>–from</strong> option to format-patch.
Accepts a boolean value, or a name and email address. If false,
format-patch defaults to <strong>–no-from</strong>, using commit authors directly in
the &#34;From:&#34; field of patch mails. If true, format-patch defaults to
<strong>–from</strong>, using your committer identity in the &#34;From:&#34; field of patch
mails and including a &#34;From:&#34; field in the body of the patch mail if
different. If set to a non-boolean value, format-patch uses that value
instead of your committer identity. Defaults to false.</p>

format.numbered</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean which can enable or disable sequence numbers in patch
subjects. It defaults to &#34;auto&#34; which enables it only if there is more
than one patch. It can be enabled or disabled for all messages by
setting it to &#34;true&#34; or &#34;false&#34;. See –numbered option in

<p>
format.subjectPrefix</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The default for format-patch is to output files with the <em>[PATCH]</em>

</blockquote>
<p>
format.coverFromDescription</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The default mode for format-patch to determine which parts of the cover
letter will be populated using the branch&#39;s description. See the
<strong>–cover-from-description</strong> option in *git-format-patch*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
format.signature</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The default for format-patch is to output a signature containing the Git
version number. Use this variable to change that default. Set this
variable to the empty string (&#34;&#34;) to suppress signature generation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
format.signatureFile</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Works just like format.signature except the contents of the file
specified by this variable will be used as the signature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
format.suffix</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The default for format-patch is to output files with the suffix
<strong>.patch</strong>. Use this variable to change that suffix (make sure to include
the dot if you want it).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
format.encodeEmailHeaders</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Encode email headers that have non-ASCII characters with &#34;Q-encoding&#34;
(described in RFC 2047) for email transmission. Defaults to true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
format.pretty</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The default pretty format for log/show/whatchanged command. See
*git-log*(1), *git-show*(1), *git-whatchanged*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
format.thread</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The default threading style for <em>git format-patch</em>. Can be a boolean
value, or <strong>shallow</strong> or <strong>deep</strong>. <strong>shallow</strong> threading makes every mail a
reply to the head of the series, where the head is chosen from the cover
letter, the <strong>–in-reply-to</strong>, and the first patch mail, in this order.
<strong>deep</strong> threading makes every mail a reply to the previous one. A true
boolean value is the same as <strong>shallow</strong>, and a false value disables
threading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
format.signOff</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean value which lets you enable the <strong>-s/–signoff</strong> option of
format-patch by default. <strong>Note:</strong> Adding the <strong>Signed-off-by</strong> trailer to a
patch should be a conscious act and means that you certify you have the
rights to submit this work under the same open source license. Please
see the <em>SubmittingPatches</em> document for further discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
format.coverLetter</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean that controls whether to generate a cover-letter when
format-patch is invoked, but in addition can be set to &#34;auto&#34;, to
generate a cover-letter only when there&#39;s more than one patch. Default
is false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
format.outputDirectory</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set a custom directory to store the resulting files instead of the
current working directory. All directory components will be created.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
format.filenameMaxLength</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The maximum length of the output filenames generated by the
<strong>format-patch</strong> command; defaults to 64. Can be overridden by the
<strong>–filename-max-length=&lt;n&gt;</strong> command line option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
format.useAutoBase</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean value which lets you enable the <strong>–base=auto</strong> option of
format-patch by default. Can also be set to &#34;whenAble&#34; to allow enabling
<strong>–base=auto</strong> if a suitable base is available, but to skip adding base
info otherwise without the format dying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
format.notes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provides the default value for the <strong>–notes</strong> option to format-patch.
Accepts a boolean value, or a ref which specifies where to get notes. If
false, format-patch defaults to <strong>–no-notes</strong>. If true, format-patch
defaults to <strong>–notes</strong>. If set to a non-boolean value, format-patch
defaults to <strong>–notes=&lt;ref&gt;</strong>, where <strong>ref</strong> is the non-boolean value.
Defaults to false.</p>
<p>
If one wishes to use the ref <strong>refs/notes/true</strong>, please use that literal
instead.</p>
<p>
This configuration can be specified multiple times in order to allow
multiple notes refs to be included. In that case, it will behave
similarly to multiple <strong>–[no-]notes[=]</strong> options passed in. That is, a
value of <strong>true</strong> will show the default notes, a value of <strong>&lt;ref&gt;</strong> will
also show notes from that notes ref and a value of <strong>false</strong> will negate
previous configurations and not show notes.</p>
<p>
For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
[format]
        notes = true
        notes = foo
        notes = false
        notes = bar
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
will only show notes from <strong>refs/notes/bar</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
format.mboxrd</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean value which enables the robust &#34;mboxrd&#34; format when <strong>–stdout</strong>
is in use to escape &#34;^&gt;+From &#34; lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
format.noprefix</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set, do not show any source or destination prefix in patches. This is
equivalent to the <strong>diff.noprefix</strong> option used by <strong>git diff</strong> (but which
is not respected by <strong>format-patch</strong>). Note that by setting this, the
receiver of any patches you generate will have to apply them using the
<strong>-p0</strong> option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During fsck git may find issues with legacy data which wouldn&#39;t be
generated by current versions of git, and which wouldn&#39;t be sent over
the wire if <strong>transfer.fsckObjects</strong> was set. This feature is intended to
support working with legacy repositories containing such data.</p>
<p>
Setting <strong>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</strong> will be picked up by <strong>git-fsck*(1), but to
accept pushes of such data set *receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</strong> instead, or to
clone or fetch it set <strong>fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>
The rest of the documentation discusses <strong>fsck.*</strong> for brevity, but the
same applies for the corresponding <strong>receive.fsck.*</strong> and <strong>fetch.fsck.*</strong>.
variables.</p>
<p>
Unlike variables like <strong>color.ui</strong> and <strong>core.editor</strong>, the
<strong>receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</strong> and <strong>fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</strong> variables will not
fall back on the <strong>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</strong> configuration if they aren&#39;t set. To
uniformly configure the same fsck settings in different circumstances,
all three of them must be set to the same values.</p>
<p>
When <strong>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</strong> is set, errors can be switched to warnings and vice
versa by configuring the <strong>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</strong> setting where the <strong>&lt;msg-id&gt;</strong> is
the fsck message ID and the value is one of <strong>error</strong>, <strong>warn</strong> or <strong>ignore</strong>.
For convenience, fsck prefixes the error/warning with the message ID,
e.g. &#34;missingEmail: invalid author/committer line - missing email&#34; means
that setting <strong>fsck.missingEmail = ignore</strong> will hide that issue.</p>
<p>
In general, it is better to enumerate existing objects with problems
with <strong>fsck.skipList</strong>, instead of listing the kind of breakages these
problematic objects share to be ignored, as doing the latter will allow
new instances of the same breakages go unnoticed.</p>
<p>
Setting an unknown <strong>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</strong> value will cause fsck to die, but
doing the same for <strong>receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</strong> and <strong>fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</strong>
will only cause git to warn.</p>
<p>
See the <strong>Fsck Messages</strong> section of <strong>git-fsck*(1) for supported values of
*&lt;msg-id&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
fsck.skipList</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The path to a list of object names (i.e. one unabbreviated SHA-1 per
line) that are known to be broken in a non-fatal way and should be
ignored. On versions of Git 2.20 and later, comments (<em>#</em>), empty lines,
and any leading and trailing whitespace are ignored. Everything but a
SHA-1 per line will error out on older versions.</p>
<p>
This feature is useful when an established project should be accepted
despite early commits containing errors that can be safely ignored, such
as invalid committer email addresses. Note: corrupt objects cannot be
skipped with this setting.</p>
<p>
Like <strong>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</strong> this variable has corresponding
<strong>receive.fsck.skipList</strong> and <strong>fetch.fsck.skipList</strong> variants.</p>
<p>
Unlike variables like <strong>color.ui</strong> and <strong>core.editor</strong> the
<strong>receive.fsck.skipList</strong> and <strong>fetch.fsck.skipList</strong> variables will not
fall back on the <strong>fsck.skipList</strong> configuration if they aren&#39;t set. To
uniformly configure the same fsck settings in different circumstances,
all three of them must be set to the same values.</p>
<p>
Older versions of Git (before 2.20) documented that the object names
list should be sorted. This was never a requirement; the object names
could appear in any order, but when reading the list we tracked whether
the list was sorted for the purposes of an internal binary search
implementation, which could save itself some work with an already sorted
list. Unless you had a humongous list there was no reason to go out of
your way to pre-sort the list. After Git version 2.20 a hash
implementation is used instead, so there&#39;s now no reason to pre-sort the
list.</p>

fsmonitor.allowRemote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, the fsmonitor daemon refuses to work with network-mounted
repositories. Setting <strong>fsmonitor.allowRemote</strong> to <strong>true</strong> overrides this
behavior. Only respected when <strong>core.fsmonitor</strong> is set to <strong>true</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
fsmonitor.socketDir</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This Mac OS-specific option, if set, specifies the directory in which to

<p>
gc.aggressiveDepth</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The depth parameter used in the delta compression algorithm used by <em>git
gc –aggressive</em>. This defaults to 50, which is the default for the
<strong>–depth</strong> option when <strong>–aggressive</strong> isn&#39;t in use.</p>
<p>
See the documentation for the <strong>–depth</strong> option in *git-repack*(1) for
more details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.aggressiveWindow</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The window size parameter used in the delta compression algorithm used
by <em>git gc –aggressive</em>. This defaults to 250, which is a much more
aggressive window size than the default <strong>–window</strong> of 10.</p>
<p>
See the documentation for the <strong>–window</strong> option in *git-repack*(1) for
more details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.auto</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When there are approximately more than this many loose objects in the
repository, <strong>git gc –auto</strong> will pack them. Some Porcelain commands use
this command to perform a light-weight garbage collection from time to
time. The default value is 6700.</p>
<p>
Setting this to 0 disables not only automatic packing based on the
number of loose objects, but also any other heuristic <strong>git gc –auto</strong>
will otherwise use to determine if there&#39;s work to do, such as
<strong>gc.autoPackLimit</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.autoPackLimit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When there are more than this many packs that are not marked with
<strong>*.keep</strong> file in the repository, <strong>git gc –auto</strong> consolidates them into
one larger pack. The default value is 50. Setting this to 0 disables it.
Setting <strong>gc.auto</strong> to 0 will also disable this.</p>
<p>
See the <strong>gc.bigPackThreshold</strong> configuration variable below. When in use,
it&#39;ll affect how the auto pack limit works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.autoDetach</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make <strong>git gc –auto</strong> return immediately and run in the background if the
system supports it. Default is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.bigPackThreshold</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If non-zero, all non-cruft packs larger than this limit are kept when
<strong>git gc</strong> is run. This is very similar to <strong>–keep-largest-pack</strong> except
that all non-cruft packs that meet the threshold are kept, not just the
largest pack. Defaults to zero. Common unit suffixes of <em>k</em>, <em>m</em>, or <em>g</em>
are supported.</p>
<p>
Note that if the number of kept packs is more than gc.autoPackLimit,
this configuration variable is ignored, all packs except the base pack
will be repacked. After this the number of packs should go below
gc.autoPackLimit and gc.bigPackThreshold should be respected again.</p>
<p>
If the amount of memory estimated for <strong>git repack</strong> to run smoothly is
not available and <strong>gc.bigPackThreshold</strong> is not set, the largest pack
will also be excluded (this is the equivalent of running <strong>git gc</strong> with
<strong>–keep-largest-pack</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.writeCommitGraph</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, then gc will rewrite the commit-graph file when <strong>git-gc*(1) is
run. When using *git gc –auto</strong> the commit-graph will be updated if
housekeeping is required. Default is true. See *git-commit-graph*(1) for
details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.logExpiry</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the file gc.log exists, then <strong>git gc –auto</strong> will print its content
and exit with status zero instead of running unless that file is more
than <em>gc.logExpiry</em> old. Default is &#34;1.day&#34;. See <strong>gc.pruneExpire</strong> for
more ways to specify its value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.packRefs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Running <strong>git pack-refs</strong> in a repository renders it unclonable by Git
versions prior to 1.5.1.2 over dumb transports such as HTTP. This
variable determines whether <em>git gc</em> runs <strong>git pack-refs</strong>. This can be
set to <strong>notbare</strong> to enable it within all non-bare repos or it can be set
to a boolean value. The default is <strong>true</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.cruftPacks</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Store unreachable objects in a cruft pack (see <strong>git-repack*(1)) instead
of as loose objects. The default is *true</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.maxCruftSize</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the size of new cruft packs when repacking. When specified in
addition to <strong>–max-cruft-size</strong>, the command line option takes priority.
See the <strong>–max-cruft-size</strong> option of *git-repack*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.pruneExpire</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <em>git gc</em> is run, it will call <em>prune –expire 2.weeks.ago</em> (and
<em>repack –cruft –cruft-expiration 2.weeks.ago</em> if using cruft packs via
<strong>gc.cruftPacks</strong> or <strong>–cruft</strong>). Override the grace period with this
config variable. The value &#34;now&#34; may be used to disable this grace
period and always prune unreachable objects immediately, or &#34;never&#34; may
be used to suppress pruning. This feature helps prevent corruption when
<em>git gc</em> runs concurrently with another process writing to the
repository; see the &#34;NOTES&#34; section of *git-gc*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.worktreePruneExpire</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <em>git gc</em> is run, it calls <em>git worktree prune –expire
3.months.ago</em>. This config variable can be used to set a different grace
period. The value &#34;now&#34; may be used to disable the grace period and
prune <strong>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</strong> immediately, or &#34;never&#34; may be used to
suppress pruning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.reflogExpire, gc.&lt;pattern&gt;.reflogExpire</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>git reflog expire</em> removes reflog entries older than this time;
defaults to 90 days. The value &#34;now&#34; expires all entries immediately,
and &#34;never&#34; suppresses expiration altogether. With &#34;&lt;pattern&gt;&#34; (e.g.
&#34;refs/stash&#34;) in the middle the setting applies only to the refs that
match the &lt;pattern&gt;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gc.reflogExpireUnreachable, gc.&lt;pattern&gt;.reflogExpireUnreachable</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>git reflog expire</em> removes reflog entries older than this time and are
not reachable from the current tip; defaults to 30 days. The value &#34;now&#34;
expires all entries immediately, and &#34;never&#34; suppresses expiration
altogether. With &#34;&lt;pattern&gt;&#34; (e.g. &#34;refs/stash&#34;) in the middle, the
setting applies only to the refs that match the &lt;pattern&gt;.</p>
<p>
These types of entries are generally created as a result of using <strong>git
commit –amend</strong> or <strong>git rebase</strong> and are the commits prior to the amend

gc.recentObjectsHook</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When considering whether or not to remove an object (either when
generating a cruft pack or storing unreachable objects as loose), use
the shell to execute the specified command(s). Interpret their output as
object IDs which Git will consider as &#34;recent&#34;, regardless of their age.
By treating their mtimes as &#34;now&#34;, any objects (and their descendants)
mentioned in the output will be kept regardless of their true age.</p>
<p>
Output must contain exactly one hex object ID per line, and nothing
else. Objects which cannot be found in the repository are ignored.
Multiple hooks are supported, but all must exit successfully, else the
operation (either generating a cruft pack or unpacking unreachable
objects) will be halted.</p>

<p>
gitcvs.usecrlfattr</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, the server will look up the end-of-line conversion attributes
for files to determine the <strong>-k</strong> modes to use. If the attributes force
Git to treat a file as text, the <strong>-k</strong> mode will be left blank so CVS
clients will treat it as text. If they suppress text conversion, the
file will be set with <em>-kb</em> mode, which suppresses any newline munging
the client might otherwise do. If the attributes do not allow the file
type to be determined, then <strong>gitcvs.allBinary</strong> is used. See
*gitattributes*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gitcvs.allBinary</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is used if <strong>gitcvs.usecrlfattr</strong> does not resolve the correct <em>-kb</em>
mode to use. If true, all unresolved files are sent to the client in
mode <em>-kb</em>. This causes the client to treat them as binary files, which
suppresses any newline munging it otherwise might do. Alternatively, if
it is set to &#34;guess&#34;, then the contents of the file are examined to
decide if it is binary, similar to <strong>core.autocrlf</strong>.</p>

gitcvs.dbName</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Database used by git-cvsserver to cache revision information derived

gpg.program</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use this custom program instead of &#34;<strong>gpg</strong>&#34; found on <strong>$PATH</strong> when making
or verifying a PGP signature. The program must support the same
command-line interface as GPG, namely, to verify a detached signature,
&#34;<strong>gpg –verify $signature - &lt;$file</strong>&#34; is run, and the program is expected
to signal a good signature by exiting with code 0. To generate an
ASCII-armored detached signature, the standard input of &#34;<strong>gpg -bsau
$key</strong>&#34; is fed with the contents to be signed, and the program is
expected to send the result to its standard output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gpg.format</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies which key format to use when signing with <strong>–gpg-sign</strong>.
Default is &#34;openpgp&#34;. Other possible values are &#34;x509&#34;, &#34;ssh&#34;.</p>
<p>
See <strong>gitformat-signature*(5) for the signature format, which differs

gpg.&lt;format&gt;.program</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use this to customize the program used for the signing format you chose.
(see <strong>gpg.program</strong> and <strong>gpg.format</strong>) <strong>gpg.program</strong> can still be used as
a legacy synonym for <strong>gpg.openpgp.program</strong>. The default value for
<strong>gpg.x509.program</strong> is &#34;gpgsm&#34; and <strong>gpg.ssh.program</strong> is &#34;ssh-keygen&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gpg.minTrustLevel</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies a minimum trust level for signature verification. If this
option is unset, then signature verification for merge operations
requires a key with at least <strong>marginal</strong> trust. Other operations that
perform signature verification require a key with at least <strong>undefined</strong>
trust. Setting this option overrides the required trust-level for all
operations. Supported values, in increasing order of significance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>undefined</strong></p>

<p>
gpg.ssh.defaultKeyCommand</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This command will be run when user.signingkey is not set and a ssh
signature is requested. On successful exit a valid ssh public key
prefixed with <strong>key::</strong> is expected in the first line of its output. This
allows for a script doing a dynamic lookup of the correct public key
when it is impractical to statically configure <strong>user.signingKey</strong>. For
example when keys or SSH Certificates are rotated frequently or
selection of the right key depends on external factors unknown to git.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A file containing ssh public keys which you are willing to trust. The
file consists of one or more lines of principals followed by an ssh
public key. e.g.: <strong>user1@example.com,user2@example.com ssh-rsa
AAAAX1…</strong> See ssh-keygen(1) &#34;ALLOWED SIGNERS&#34; for details. The
principal is only used to identify the key and is available when
verifying a signature.</p>
<p>
SSH has no concept of trust levels like gpg does. To be able to
differentiate between valid signatures and trusted signatures the trust
level of a signature verification is set to <strong>fully</strong> when the public key
is present in the allowedSignersFile. Otherwise the trust level is
<strong>undefined</strong> and git verify-commit/tag will fail.</p>
<p>
This file can be set to a location outside of the repository and every
developer maintains their own trust store. A central repository server
could generate this file automatically from ssh keys with push access to
verify the code against. In a corporate setting this file is probably
generated at a global location from automation that already handles
developer ssh keys.</p>
<p>
A repository that only allows signed commits can store the file in the
repository itself using a path relative to the top-level of the working
tree. This way only committers with an already valid key can add or
change keys in the keyring.</p>
<p>
Since OpensSSH 8.8 this file allows specifying a key lifetime using
valid-after &amp; valid-before options. Git will mark signatures as valid if
the signing key was valid at the time of the signature&#39;s creation. This
allows users to change a signing key without invalidating all previously
made signatures.</p>
<p>
Using a SSH CA key with the cert-authority option (see ssh-keygen(1)
&#34;CERTIFICATES&#34;) is also valid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
gpg.ssh.revocationFile</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Either a SSH KRL or a list of revoked public keys (without the principal
prefix). See ssh-keygen(1) for details. If a public key is found in this
file then it will always be treated as having trust level &#34;never&#34; and
signatures will show as invalid.</p>

guitool.&lt;name&gt;.argPrompt</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Request a string argument from the user, and pass it to the tool through

<p>
http.proxy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Override the HTTP proxy, normally configured using the <em>http_proxy</em>,
<em>https_proxy</em>, and <em>all_proxy</em> environment variables (see <strong>curl(1)</strong>). In
addition to the syntax understood by curl, it is possible to specify a
proxy string with a user name but no password, in which case git will
attempt to acquire one in the same way it does for other credentials.
See *gitcredentials*(7) for more information. The syntax thus is
<em>[protocol://][user[:password]@]proxyhost[:port]</em>. This can be
overridden on a per-remote basis; see remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxy</p>
<p>
Any proxy, however configured, must be completely transparent and must
not modify, transform, or buffer the request or response in any way.
Proxies which are not completely transparent are known to cause various
forms of breakage with Git.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.proxyAuthMethod</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the method with which to authenticate against the HTTP proxy. This
only takes effect if the configured proxy string contains a user name
part (i.e. is of the form <em>user@host</em> or <em>user@host:port</em>). This can be
overridden on a per-remote basis; see <strong>remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxyAuthMethod</strong>.
Both can be overridden by the <strong>GIT_HTTP_PROXY_AUTHMETHOD</strong> environment
variable. Possible values are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>anyauth</strong> - Automatically pick a suitable authentication method. It is
assumed that the proxy answers an unauthenticated request with a 407
status code and one or more Proxy-authenticate headers with supported
authentication methods. This is the default.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>basic</strong> - HTTP Basic authentication</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>digest</strong> - HTTP Digest authentication; this prevents the password from
being transmitted to the proxy in clear text</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>negotiate</strong> - GSS-Negotiate authentication (compare the –negotiate
option of <strong>curl(1)</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>ntlm</strong> - NTLM authentication (compare the –ntlm option of <strong>curl(1)</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.proxySSLCert</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pathname of a file that stores a client certificate to use to
authenticate with an HTTPS proxy. Can be overridden by the
<strong>GIT_PROXY_SSL_CERT</strong> environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.proxySSLKey</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pathname of a file that stores a private key to use to authenticate
with an HTTPS proxy. Can be overridden by the <strong>GIT_PROXY_SSL_KEY</strong>
environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.proxySSLCertPasswordProtected</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable Git&#39;s password prompt for the proxy SSL certificate. Otherwise
OpenSSL will prompt the user, possibly many times, if the certificate or
private key is encrypted. Can be overridden by the
<strong>GIT_PROXY_SSL_CERT_PASSWORD_PROTECTED</strong> environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.proxySSLCAInfo</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pathname to the file containing the certificate bundle that should be
used to verify the proxy with when using an HTTPS proxy. Can be
overridden by the <strong>GIT_PROXY_SSL_CAINFO</strong> environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.emptyAuth</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attempt authentication without seeking a username or password. This can
be used to attempt GSS-Negotiate authentication without specifying a
username in the URL, as libcurl normally requires a username for
authentication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.proactiveAuth</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attempt authentication without first making an unauthenticated attempt
and receiving a 401 response. This can be used to ensure that all
requests are authenticated. If <strong>http.emptyAuth</strong> is set to true, this
value has no effect.</p>
<p>
If the credential helper used specifies an authentication scheme (i.e.,
via the <strong>authtype</strong> field), that value will be used; if a username and
password is provided without a scheme, then Basic authentication is
used. The value of the option determines the scheme requested from the
helper. Possible values are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>basic</strong> - Request Basic authentication from the helper.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>auto</strong> - Allow the helper to pick an appropriate scheme.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>none</strong> - Disable proactive authentication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that TLS should always be used with this configuration, since
otherwise it is easy to accidentally expose plaintext credentials if
Basic authentication is selected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.delegation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Control GSSAPI credential delegation. The delegation is disabled by
default in libcurl since version 7.21.7. Set parameter to tell the
server what it is allowed to delegate when it comes to user credentials.
Used with GSS/kerberos. Possible values are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>none</strong> - Don&#39;t allow any delegation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>policy</strong> - Delegates if and only if the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag is set in
the Kerberos service ticket, which is a matter of realm policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>always</strong> - Unconditionally allow the server to delegate.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.extraHeader</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pass an additional HTTP header when communicating with a server. If more
than one such entry exists, all of them are added as extra headers. To
allow overriding the settings inherited from the system config, an empty
value will reset the extra headers to the empty list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.cookieFile</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pathname of a file containing previously stored cookie lines, which
should be used in the Git http session, if they match the server. The
file format of the file to read cookies from should be plain HTTP
headers or the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format (see <strong>curl(1)</strong>). Set
it to an empty string, to accept only new cookies from the server and
send them back in successive requests within same connection. NOTE that
the file specified with http.cookieFile is used only as input unless
http.saveCookies is set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.saveCookies</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set, store cookies received during requests to the file specified by
http.cookieFile. Has no effect if http.cookieFile is unset, or set to an
empty string.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.version</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the specified HTTP protocol version when communicating with a
server. If you want to force the default. The available and default
version depend on libcurl. Currently the possible values of this option
are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
HTTP/2</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
HTTP/1.1</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.curloptResolve</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hostname resolution information that will be used first by libcurl when
sending HTTP requests. This information should be in one of the
following formats:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
[+]HOST:PORT:ADDRESS[,ADDRESS]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
-HOST:PORT</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The first format redirects all requests to the given <strong>HOST:PORT</strong> to the
provided <strong>ADDRESS*(s). The second format clears all previous config
values for that *HOST:PORT</strong> combination. To allow easy overriding of all
the settings inherited from the system config, an empty value will reset
all resolution information to the empty list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.sslVersion</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SSL version to use when negotiating an SSL connection, if you want
to force the default. The available and default version depend on
whether libcurl was built against NSS or OpenSSL and the particular
configuration of the crypto library in use. Internally this sets the
<em>CURLOPT_SSL_VERSION</em> option; see the libcurl documentation for more
details on the format of this option and for the ssl version supported.
Currently the possible values of this option are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
sslv2</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
sslv3</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
tlsv1</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
tlsv1.0</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
tlsv1.1</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
tlsv1.2</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
tlsv1.3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Can be overridden by the <strong>GIT_SSL_VERSION</strong> environment variable. To
force git to use libcurl&#39;s default ssl version and ignore any explicit
http.sslversion option, set <strong>GIT_SSL_VERSION</strong> to the empty string.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.sslCipherList</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A list of SSL ciphers to use when negotiating an SSL connection. The
available ciphers depend on whether libcurl was built against NSS or
OpenSSL and the particular configuration of the crypto library in use.
Internally this sets the <em>CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST</em> option; see the
libcurl documentation for more details on the format of this list.</p>
<p>
Can be overridden by the <strong>GIT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST</strong> environment variable. To
force git to use libcurl&#39;s default cipher list and ignore any explicit
http.sslCipherList option, set <strong>GIT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST</strong> to the empty
string.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.sslVerify</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether to verify the SSL certificate when fetching or pushing over
HTTPS. Defaults to true. Can be overridden by the <strong>GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY</strong>
environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.sslCert</p>
<blockquote>
<p>File containing the SSL certificate when fetching or pushing over HTTPS.
Can be overridden by the <strong>GIT_SSL_CERT</strong> environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.sslKey</p>
<blockquote>
<p>File containing the SSL private key when fetching or pushing over HTTPS.
Can be overridden by the <strong>GIT_SSL_KEY</strong> environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.sslCertPasswordProtected</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable Git&#39;s password prompt for the SSL certificate. Otherwise OpenSSL
will prompt the user, possibly many times, if the certificate or private
key is encrypted. Can be overridden by the
<strong>GIT_SSL_CERT_PASSWORD_PROTECTED</strong> environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.sslCAInfo</p>
<blockquote>
<p>File containing the certificates to verify the peer with when fetching
or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the <strong>GIT_SSL_CAINFO</strong>
environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.sslCAPath</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Path containing files with the CA certificates to verify the peer with
when fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the
<strong>GIT_SSL_CAPATH</strong> environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.sslBackend</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Name of the SSL backend to use (e.g. &#34;openssl&#34; or &#34;schannel&#34;). This
option is ignored if cURL lacks support for choosing the SSL backend at
runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.schannelCheckRevoke</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Used to enforce or disable certificate revocation checks in cURL when
http.sslBackend is set to &#34;schannel&#34;. Defaults to <strong>true</strong> if unset. Only
necessary to disable this if Git consistently errors and the message is
about checking the revocation status of a certificate. This option is
ignored if cURL lacks support for setting the relevant SSL option at
runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.schannelUseSSLCAInfo</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of cURL v7.60.0, the Secure Channel backend can use the certificate
bundle provided via <strong>http.sslCAInfo</strong>, but that would override the
Windows Certificate Store. Since this is not desirable by default, Git
will tell cURL not to use that bundle by default when the <strong>schannel</strong>
backend was configured via <strong>http.sslBackend</strong>, unless
<strong>http.schannelUseSSLCAInfo</strong> overrides this behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.pinnedPubkey</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Public key of the https service. It may either be the filename of a PEM
or DER encoded public key file or a string starting with <em>sha256//</em>
followed by the base64 encoded sha256 hash of the public key. See also
libcurl <em>CURLOPT_PINNEDPUBLICKEY</em>. git will exit with an error if this
option is set but not supported by cURL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.sslTry</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attempt to use AUTH SSL/TLS and encrypted data transfers when connecting
via regular FTP protocol. This might be needed if the FTP server
requires it for security reasons or you wish to connect securely
whenever remote FTP server supports it. Default is false since it might
trigger certificate verification errors on misconfigured servers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.maxRequests</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How many HTTP requests to launch in parallel. Can be overridden by the
<strong>GIT_HTTP_MAX_REQUESTS</strong> environment variable. Default is 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.minSessions</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of curl sessions (counted across slots) to be kept across
requests. They will not be ended with curl_easy_cleanup() until
http_cleanup() is invoked. If USE_CURL_MULTI is not defined, this value
will be capped at 1. Defaults to 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.postBuffer</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maximum size in bytes of the buffer used by smart HTTP transports when
POSTing data to the remote system. For requests larger than this buffer
size, HTTP/1.1 and Transfer-Encoding: chunked is used to avoid creating
a massive pack file locally. Default is 1 MiB, which is sufficient for
most requests.</p>
<p>
Note that raising this limit is only effective for disabling chunked
transfer encoding and therefore should be used only where the remote
server or a proxy only supports HTTP/1.0 or is noncompliant with the
HTTP standard. Raising this is not, in general, an effective solution
for most push problems, but can increase memory consumption
significantly since the entire buffer is allocated even for small
pushes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.lowSpeedLimit, http.lowSpeedTime</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the HTTP transfer speed, in bytes per second, is less than
<em>http.lowSpeedLimit</em> for longer than <em>http.lowSpeedTime</em> seconds, the
transfer is aborted. Can be overridden by the <strong>GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT</strong>
and <strong>GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_TIME</strong> environment variables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.noEPSV</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean which disables using of EPSV ftp command by curl. This can be
helpful with some &#34;poor&#34; ftp servers which don&#39;t support EPSV mode. Can
be overridden by the <strong>GIT_CURL_FTP_NO_EPSV</strong> environment variable.
Default is false (curl will use EPSV).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.userAgent</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The HTTP USER_AGENT string presented to an HTTP server. The default
value represents the version of the Git client such as git/1.7.1. This
option allows you to override this value to a more common value such as
Mozilla/4.0. This may be necessary, for instance, if connecting through
a firewall that restricts HTTP connections to a set of common USER_AGENT
strings (but not including those like git/1.7.1). Can be overridden by
the <strong>GIT_HTTP_USER_AGENT</strong> environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.followRedirects</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether git should follow HTTP redirects. If set to <strong>true</strong>, git will
transparently follow any redirect issued by a server it encounters. If
set to <strong>false</strong>, git will treat all redirects as errors. If set to
<strong>initial</strong>, git will follow redirects only for the initial request to a
remote, but not for subsequent follow-up HTTP requests. Since git uses
the redirected URL as the base for the follow-up requests, this is
generally sufficient. The default is <strong>initial</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
http.&lt;url&gt;.*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any of the http.* options above can be applied selectively to some URLs.
For a config key to match a URL, each element of the config key is
compared to that of the URL, in the following order:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Scheme (e.g., <strong>https</strong> in <strong><a href="https://example.com/">https://example.com/</a></strong>). This field must match
exactly between the config key and the URL.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Host/domain name (e.g., <strong>example.com</strong> in <strong><a href="https://example.com/">https://example.com/</a></strong>). This
field must match between the config key and the URL. It is possible to
specify a <strong>*</strong> as part of the host name to match all subdomains at this
level. <strong>https://</strong>.example.com/* for example would match
<strong><a href="https://foo.example.com/">https://foo.example.com/</a></strong>, but not <strong><a href="https://foo.bar.example.com/">https://foo.bar.example.com/</a></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Port number (e.g., <strong>8080</strong> in <strong><a href="http://example.com:8080/">http://example.com:8080/</a></strong>). This field
must match exactly between the config key and the URL. Omitted port
numbers are automatically converted to the correct default for the
scheme before matching.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Path (e.g., <strong>repo.git</strong> in <strong><a href="https://example.com/repo.git">https://example.com/repo.git</a></strong>). The path
field of the config key must match the path field of the URL either
exactly or as a prefix of slash-delimited path elements. This means a
config key with path <strong>foo/</strong> matches URL path <strong>foo/bar</strong>. A prefix can
only match on a slash (<strong>/</strong>) boundary. Longer matches take precedence (so
a config key with path <strong>foo/bar</strong> is a better match to URL path <strong>foo/bar</strong>
than a config key with just path <strong>foo/</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>User name (e.g., <strong>user</strong> in <strong><a href="https://user@example.com/repo.git">https://user@example.com/repo.git</a></strong>). If the
config key has a user name it must match the user name in the URL
exactly. If the config key does not have a user name, that config key
will match a URL with any user name (including none), but at a lower
precedence than a config key with a user name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The list above is ordered by decreasing precedence; a URL that matches a
config key&#39;s path is preferred to one that matches its user name. For
example, if the URL is <strong><a href="https://user@example.com/foo/bar">https://user@example.com/foo/bar</a></strong> a config key
match of <strong><a href="https://example.com/foo">https://example.com/foo</a></strong> will be preferred over a config key
match of <strong><a href="https://user@example.com">https://user@example.com</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
All URLs are normalized before attempting any matching (the password
part, if embedded in the URL, is always ignored for matching purposes)
so that equivalent URLs that are simply spelled differently will match
properly. Environment variable settings always override any matches. The
URLs that are matched against are those given directly to Git commands.
This means any URLs visited as a result of a redirection do not
participate in matching.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
i18n.commitEncoding</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Character encoding the commit messages are stored in; Git itself does
not care per se, but this information is necessary e.g. when importing
commits from emails or in the gitk graphical history browser (and
possibly in other places in the future or in other porcelains). See e.g.
*git-mailinfo*(1). Defaults to <em>utf-8</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
i18n.logOutputEncoding</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Character encoding the commit messages are converted to when running
<em>git log</em> and friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
imap.folder</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The folder to drop the mails into, which is typically the Drafts folder.
For example: &#34;INBOX.Drafts&#34;, &#34;INBOX/Drafts&#34; or &#34;[Gmail]/Drafts&#34;.
Required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
imap.tunnel</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Command used to set up a tunnel to the IMAP server through which
commands will be piped instead of using a direct network connection to
the server. Required when imap.host is not set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
imap.host</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A URL identifying the server. Use an <strong>imap://</strong> prefix for non-secure
connections and an <strong>imaps://</strong> prefix for secure connections. Ignored
when imap.tunnel is set, but required otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
imap.user</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The username to use when logging in to the server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
imap.pass</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The password to use when logging in to the server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
imap.port</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An integer port number to connect to on the server. Defaults to 143 for
imap:// hosts and 993 for imaps:// hosts. Ignored when imap.tunnel is
set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
imap.sslverify</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean to enable/disable verification of the server certificate used
by the SSL/TLS connection. Default is <strong>true</strong>. Ignored when imap.tunnel
is set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
imap.preformattedHTML</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean to enable/disable the use of html encoding when sending a
patch. An html encoded patch will be bracketed with &lt;pre&gt; and have a
content type of text/html. Ironically, enabling this option causes
Thunderbird to send the patch as a plain/text, format=fixed email.
Default is <strong>false</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
imap.authMethod</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the authentication method for authenticating with the IMAP
server. If Git was built with the NO_CURL option, or if your curl
version is older than 7.34.0, or if you&#39;re running git-imap-send with
the <strong>–no-curl</strong> option, the only supported method is <em>CRAM-MD5</em>. If this
is not set then <em>git imap-send</em> uses the basic IMAP plaintext LOGIN
command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
include.path, includeIf.&lt;condition&gt;.path</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Special variables to include other configuration files. See the
&#34;CONFIGURATION FILE&#34; section in the main *git-config*(1) documentation,
specifically the &#34;Includes&#34; and &#34;Conditional Includes&#34; subsections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
index.recordEndOfIndexEntries</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies whether the index file should include an &#34;End Of Index Entry&#34;
section. This reduces index load time on multiprocessor machines but
produces a message &#34;ignoring EOIE extension&#34; when reading the index
using Git versions before 2.20. Defaults to <em>true</em> if index.threads has
been explicitly enabled, <em>false</em> otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
index.recordOffsetTable</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies whether the index file should include an &#34;Index Entry Offset
Table&#34; section. This reduces index load time on multiprocessor machines
but produces a message &#34;ignoring IEOT extension&#34; when reading the index
using Git versions before 2.20. Defaults to <em>true</em> if index.threads has
been explicitly enabled, <em>false</em> otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
index.sparse</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When enabled, write the index using sparse-directory entries. This has
no effect unless <strong>core.sparseCheckout</strong> and <strong>core.sparseCheckoutCone</strong> are
both enabled. Defaults to <em>false</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
index.threads</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the number of threads to spawn when loading the index. This is
meant to reduce index load time on multiprocessor machines. Specifying 0
or <em>true</em> will cause Git to auto-detect the number of CPUs and set the
number of threads accordingly. Specifying 1 or <em>false</em> will disable
multithreading. Defaults to <em>true</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
index.version</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the version with which new index files should be initialized.
This does not affect existing repositories. If <strong>feature.manyFiles</strong> is
enabled, then the default is 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
index.skipHash</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When enabled, do not compute the trailing hash for the index file. This
accelerates Git commands that manipulate the index, such as <strong>git add</strong>,
<strong>git commit</strong>, or <strong>git status</strong>. Instead of storing the checksum, write a
trailing set of bytes with value zero, indicating that the computation
was skipped.</p>
<p>
If you enable <strong>index.skipHash</strong>, then Git clients older than 2.13.0 will
refuse to parse the index and Git clients older than 2.40.0 will report
an error during <strong>git fsck</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>init.templateDir</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the directory from which templates will be copied. (See the
&#34;TEMPLATE DIRECTORY&#34; section of *git-init*(1).)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>init.defaultBranch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allows overriding the default branch name e.g. when initializing a new
repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
instaweb.browser</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the program that will be used to browse your working repository
in gitweb. See *git-instaweb*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
instaweb.httpd</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The HTTP daemon command-line to start gitweb on your working repository.
See *git-instaweb*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
instaweb.local</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true the web server started by *git-instaweb*(1) will be bound to the
local IP (127.0.0.1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
instaweb.modulePath</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The default module path for *git-instaweb*(1) to use instead of
/usr/lib/apache2/modules. Only used if httpd is Apache.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
instaweb.port</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The port number to bind the gitweb httpd to. See *git-instaweb*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
interactive.singleKey</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When set to true, allow the user to provide one-letter input with a
single key (i.e., without hitting the Enter key) in interactive
commands. This is currently used by the <strong>–patch</strong> mode of *git-add*(1),
*git-checkout*(1), *git-restore*(1), *git-commit*(1), *git-reset*(1),
and *git-stash*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
interactive.diffFilter</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When an interactive command (such as <strong>git add –patch</strong>) shows a
colorized diff, git will pipe the diff through the shell command defined
by this configuration variable. The command may mark up the diff further
for human consumption, provided that it retains a one-to-one
correspondence with the lines in the original diff. Defaults to disabled
(no filtering).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
log.abbrevCommit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, makes <strong>git-log*(1), *git-show*(1), and *git-whatchanged*(1)
assume *–abbrev-commit</strong>. You may override this option with
<strong>–no-abbrev-commit</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
log.date</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set the default date-time mode for the <em>log</em> command. Setting a value
for log.date is similar to using /git log/s <strong>–date</strong> option. See
*git-log*(1) for details.</p>
<p>
If the format is set to &#34;auto:foo&#34; and the pager is in use, format &#34;foo&#34;
will be used for the date format. Otherwise, &#34;default&#34; will be used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
log.decorate</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown by the log
command. If <em>short</em> is specified, the ref name prefixes <em>refs/heads/</em>,
<em>refs/tags/</em> and <em>refs/remotes/</em> will not be printed. If <em>full</em> is
specified, the full ref name (including prefix) will be printed. If
<em>auto</em> is specified, then if the output is going to a terminal, the ref
names are shown as if <em>short</em> were given, otherwise no ref names are
shown. This is the same as the <strong>–decorate</strong> option of the <strong>git log</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
log.initialDecorationSet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, <strong>git log</strong> only shows decorations for certain known ref
namespaces. If <em>all</em> is specified, then show all refs as decorations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
log.excludeDecoration</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exclude the specified patterns from the log decorations. This is similar
to the <strong>–decorate-refs-exclude</strong> command-line option, but the config
option can be overridden by the <strong>–decorate-refs</strong> option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
log.diffMerges</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set diff format to be used when <strong>–diff-merges=on</strong> is specified, see
<strong>–diff-merges</strong> in <strong>git-log*(1) for details. Defaults to *separate</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
log.follow</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <strong>true</strong>, <strong>git log</strong> will act as if the <strong>–follow</strong> option was used when
a single &lt;path&gt; is given. This has the same limitations as <strong>–follow</strong>,
i.e. it cannot be used to follow multiple files and does not work well
on non-linear history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
log.graphColors</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A list of colors, separated by commas, that can be used to draw history
lines in <strong>git log –graph</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
log.showRoot</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, the initial commit will be shown as a big creation event. This
is equivalent to a diff against an empty tree. Tools like *git-log*(1)
or *git-whatchanged*(1), which normally hide the root commit will now
show it. True by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
log.showSignature</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, makes <strong>git-log*(1), *git-show*(1), and *git-whatchanged*(1)
assume *–show-signature</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
log.mailmap</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, makes <strong>git-log*(1), *git-show*(1), and *git-whatchanged*(1)
assume *–use-mailmap</strong>, otherwise assume <strong>–no-use-mailmap</strong>. True by
default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
lsrefs.unborn</p>
<blockquote>
<p>May be &#34;advertise&#34; (the default), &#34;allow&#34;, or &#34;ignore&#34;. If &#34;advertise&#34;,
the server will respond to the client sending &#34;unborn&#34; (as described in
*gitprotocol-v2*(5)) and will advertise support for this feature during
the protocol v2 capability advertisement. &#34;allow&#34; is the same as
&#34;advertise&#34; except that the server will not advertise support for this
feature; this is useful for load-balanced servers that cannot be updated
atomically (for example), since the administrator could configure
&#34;allow&#34;, then after a delay, configure &#34;advertise&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
mailinfo.scissors</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, makes *git-mailinfo*(1) (and therefore *git-am*(1)) act by
default as if the –scissors option was provided on the command-line.
When active, this feature removes everything from the message body
before a scissors line (i.e. consisting mainly of &#34;&gt;8&#34;, &#34;8&lt;&#34; and &#34;-&#34;).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
mailmap.file</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The location of an augmenting mailmap file. The default mailmap, located
in the root of the repository, is loaded first, then the mailmap file
pointed to by this variable. The location of the mailmap file may be in
a repository subdirectory, or somewhere outside of the repository
itself. See *git-shortlog*(1) and *git-blame*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
mailmap.blob</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like <strong>mailmap.file</strong>, but consider the value as a reference to a blob in
the repository. If both <strong>mailmap.file</strong> and <strong>mailmap.blob</strong> are given,
both are parsed, with entries from <strong>mailmap.file</strong> taking precedence. In
a bare repository, this defaults to <strong>HEAD:.mailmap</strong>. In a non-bare
repository, it defaults to empty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
maintenance.auto</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This boolean config option controls whether some commands run <strong>git
maintenance run –auto</strong> after doing their normal work. Defaults to true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
maintenance.strategy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This string config option provides a way to specify one of a few
recommended schedules for background maintenance. This only affects
which tasks are run during <strong>git maintenance run –schedule=X</strong> commands,
provided no <strong>–task=&lt;task&gt;</strong> arguments are provided. Further, if a
<strong>maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.schedule</strong> config value is set, then that value is
used instead of the one provided by <strong>maintenance.strategy</strong>. The possible
strategy strings are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>none</strong>: This default setting implies no tasks are run at any schedule.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>incremental</strong>: This setting optimizes for performing small maintenance
activities that do not delete any data. This does not schedule the <strong>gc</strong>
task, but runs the <strong>prefetch</strong> and <strong>commit-graph</strong> tasks hourly, the
<strong>loose-objects</strong> and <strong>incremental-repack</strong> tasks daily, and the
<strong>pack-refs</strong> task weekly.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.enabled</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This boolean config option controls whether the maintenance task with
name <strong>&lt;task&gt;</strong> is run when no <strong>–task</strong> option is specified to <strong>git
maintenance run</strong>. These config values are ignored if a <strong>–task</strong> option
exists. By default, only <strong>maintenance.gc.enabled</strong> is true.</p>

<p>
maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.schedule</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This config option controls whether or not the given <strong>&lt;task&gt;</strong> runs
during a <strong>git maintenance run –schedule=&lt;frequency&gt;</strong> command. The value
must be one of &#34;hourly&#34;, &#34;daily&#34;, or &#34;weekly&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
maintenance.commit-graph.auto</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This integer config option controls how often the <strong>commit-graph</strong> task
should be run as part of <strong>git maintenance run –auto</strong>. If zero, then the
<strong>commit-graph</strong> task will not run with the <strong>–auto</strong> option. A negative
value will force the task to run every time. Otherwise, a positive value
implies the command should run when the number of reachable commits that
are not in the commit-graph file is at least the value of
<strong>maintenance.commit-graph.auto</strong>. The default value is 100.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
maintenance.loose-objects.auto</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This integer config option controls how often the <strong>loose-objects</strong> task

then the <strong>incremental-repack</strong> task will not run with the <strong>–auto</strong>
option. A negative value will force the task to run every time.
Otherwise, a positive value implies the command should run when the
number of pack-files not in the multi-pack-index is at least the value
of <strong>maintenance.incremental-repack.auto</strong>. The default value is 10.</p>

<p>
man.viewer</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the programs that may be used to display help in the <em>man</em>
format. See *git-help*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
man.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the command to invoke the specified man viewer. The specified
command is evaluated in shell with the man page passed as an argument.
(See *git-help*(1).)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
man.&lt;tool&gt;.path</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Override the path for the given tool that may be used to display help in
the <em>man</em> format. See *git-help*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
merge.conflictStyle</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the style in which conflicted hunks are written out to working
tree files upon merge. The default is &#34;merge&#34;, which shows a <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong>
conflict marker, changes made by one side, a <strong><code class="verbatim">=====</code></strong> marker, changes
made by the other side, and then a <strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> marker. An alternate style,
&#34;diff3&#34;, adds a <strong>|||||||</strong> marker and the original text before the
<strong><code class="verbatim">=====</code></strong> marker. The &#34;merge&#34; style tends to produce smaller conflict
regions than diff3, both because of the exclusion of the original text,
and because when a subset of lines match on the two sides, they are just
pulled out of the conflict region. Another alternate style, &#34;zdiff3&#34;, is
similar to diff3 but removes matching lines on the two sides from the
conflict region when those matching lines appear near either the
beginning or end of a conflict region.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
merge.defaultToUpstream</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If merge is called without any commit argument, merge the upstream
branches configured for the current branch by using their last observed
values stored in their remote-tracking branches. The values of the
<strong>branch.&lt;current branch&gt;.merge</strong> that name the branches at the remote
named by <strong>branch.&lt;current branch&gt;.remote</strong> are consulted, and then they
are mapped via <strong>remote.&lt;remote&gt;.fetch</strong> to their corresponding
remote-tracking branches, and the tips of these tracking branches are
merged. Defaults to true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
merge.ff</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit when merging a
commit that is a descendant of the current commit. Instead, the tip of
the current branch is fast-forwarded. When set to <strong>false</strong>, this variable
tells Git to create an extra merge commit in such a case (equivalent to
giving the <strong>–no-ff</strong> option from the command line). When set to <strong>only</strong>,
only such fast-forward merges are allowed (equivalent to giving the
<strong>–ff-only</strong> option from the command line).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
merge.verifySignatures</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, this is equivalent to the –verify-signatures command line
option. See *git-merge*(1) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
merge.branchdesc</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to branch names, populate the log message with the branch
description text associated with them. Defaults to false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
merge.log</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to branch names, populate the log message with at most the
specified number of one-line descriptions from the actual commits that
are being merged. Defaults to false, and true is a synonym for 20.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
merge.suppressDest</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By adding a glob that matches the names of integration branches to this
multi-valued configuration variable, the default merge message computed
for merges into these integration branches will omit &#34;into &lt;branch
name&gt;&#34; from its title.</p>
<p>
An element with an empty value can be used to clear the list of globs
accumulated from previous configuration entries. When there is no
<strong>merge.suppressDest</strong> variable defined, the default value of <strong>master</strong> is
used for backward compatibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
merge.renameLimit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of files to consider in the exhaustive portion of rename
detection during a merge. If not specified, defaults to the value of
diff.renameLimit. If neither merge.renameLimit nor diff.renameLimit are
specified, currently defaults to 7000. This setting has no effect if
rename detection is turned off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
merge.renames</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether Git detects renames. If set to &#34;false&#34;, rename detection is
disabled. If set to &#34;true&#34;, basic rename detection is enabled. Defaults
to the value of diff.renames.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
merge.directoryRenames</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether Git detects directory renames, affecting what happens at merge
time to new files added to a directory on one side of history when that
directory was renamed on the other side of history. If
merge.directoryRenames is set to &#34;false&#34;, directory rename detection is
disabled, meaning that such new files will be left behind in the old
directory. If set to &#34;true&#34;, directory rename detection is enabled,
meaning that such new files will be moved into the new directory. If set
to &#34;conflict&#34;, a conflict will be reported for such paths. If
merge.renames is false, merge.directoryRenames is ignored and treated as
false. Defaults to &#34;conflict&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
merge.renormalize</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell Git that canonical representation of files in the repository has
changed over time (e.g. earlier commits record text files with CRLF line
endings, but recent ones use LF line endings). In such a repository, Git
can convert the data recorded in commits to a canonical form before
performing a merge to reduce unnecessary conflicts. For more
information, see section &#34;Merging branches with differing
checkin/checkout attributes&#34; in *gitattributes*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
merge.stat</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether to print the diffstat between ORIG_HEAD and the merge result at
the end of the merge. True by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
merge.autoStash</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When set to true, automatically create a temporary stash entry before
the operation begins, and apply it after the operation ends. This means
that you can run merge on a dirty worktree. However, use with care: the
final stash application after a successful merge might result in
non-trivial conflicts. This option can be overridden by the
<strong>–no-autostash</strong> and <strong>–autostash</strong> options of *git-merge*(1). Defaults
to false.</p>

<em>BASE</em> is the name of a temporary file containing the common base of the
files to be merged, if available; <em>LOCAL</em> is the name of a temporary

is the name of a temporary file containing the contents of the file from
the branch being merged; <em>MERGED</em> contains the name of the file to which
the merge tool should write the results of a successful merge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.hideResolved</p>

<p>Allows the user to override the global <strong>mergetool.hideResolved</strong> value
for a specific tool. See <strong>mergetool.hideResolved</strong> for the full
description.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.trustExitCode</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a custom merge command, specify whether the exit code of the merge
command can be used to determine whether the merge was successful. If
this is not set to true then the merge target file timestamp is checked,
and the merge is assumed to have been successful if the file has been
updated; otherwise, the user is prompted to indicate the success of the
merge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
mergetool.meld.hasOutput</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Older versions of <strong>meld</strong> do not support the <strong>–output</strong> option. Git will
attempt to detect whether <strong>meld</strong> supports <strong>–output</strong> by inspecting the
output of <strong>meld –help</strong>. Configuring <strong>mergetool.meld.hasOutput</strong> will
make Git skip these checks and use the configured value instead. Setting
<strong>mergetool.meld.hasOutput</strong> to <strong>true</strong> tells Git to unconditionally use
the <strong>–output</strong> option, and <strong>false</strong> avoids using <strong>–output</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
mergetool.meld.useAutoMerge</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the <strong>–auto-merge</strong> is given, meld will merge all non-conflicting
parts automatically, highlight the conflicting parts, and wait for user
decision. Setting <strong>mergetool.meld.useAutoMerge</strong> to <strong>true</strong> tells Git to
unconditionally use the <strong>–auto-merge</strong> option with <strong>meld</strong>. Setting this
value to <strong>auto</strong> makes git detect whether <strong>–auto-merge</strong> is supported and
will only use <strong>–auto-merge</strong> when available. A value of <strong>false</strong> avoids
using <strong>–auto-merge</strong> altogether, and is the default value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
mergetool.&lt;vimdiff variant&gt;.layout</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configure the split window layout for vimdiff&#39;s <strong>&lt;variant&gt;</strong>, which is
any of <strong>vimdiff</strong>, <strong>nvimdiff</strong>, <strong>gvimdiff</strong>. Upon launching <strong>git mergetool</strong>
with <strong>–tool=&lt;variant&gt;</strong> (or without <strong>–tool</strong> if <strong>merge.tool</strong> is
configured as <strong>&lt;variant&gt;</strong>), Git will consult
<strong>mergetool.&lt;variant&gt;.layout</strong> to determine the tool&#39;s layout. If the
variant-specific configuration is not available, *vimdiff*s is used as
fallback. If that too is not available, a default layout with 4 windows
will be used. To configure the layout, see the <strong>BACKEND SPECIFIC HINTS</strong>
section in *git-mergetool*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
mergetool.hideResolved</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During a merge, Git will automatically resolve as many conflicts as
possible and write the <em>MERGED</em> file containing conflict markers around
any conflicts that it cannot resolve; <em>LOCAL</em> and <em>REMOTE</em> normally
represent the versions of the file from before Git&#39;s conflict
resolution. This flag causes <em>LOCAL</em> and <em>REMOTE</em> to be overwritten so
that only the unresolved conflicts are presented to the merge tool. Can
be configured per-tool via the <strong>mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.hideResolved</strong>
configuration variable. Defaults to <strong>false</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
mergetool.keepBackup</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After performing a merge, the original file with conflict markers can be
saved as a file with a <strong>.orig</strong> extension. If this variable is set to
<strong>false</strong> then this file is not preserved. Defaults to <strong>true</strong> (i.e. keep
the backup files).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
mergetool.keepTemporaries</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When invoking a custom merge tool, Git uses a set of temporary files to
pass to the tool. If the tool returns an error and this variable is set
to <strong>true</strong>, then these temporary files will be preserved; otherwise, they
will be removed after the tool has exited. Defaults to <strong>false</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
mergetool.writeToTemp</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Git writes temporary <em>BASE</em>, <em>LOCAL</em>, and <em>REMOTE</em> versions of
conflicting files in the worktree by default. Git will attempt to use a
temporary directory for these files when set <strong>true</strong>. Defaults to
<strong>false</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
mergetool.prompt</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prompt before each invocation of the merge resolution program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
mergetool.guiDefault</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set <strong>true</strong> to use the <strong>merge.guitool</strong> by default (equivalent to
specifying the <strong>–gui</strong> argument), or <strong>auto</strong> to select <strong>merge.guitool</strong> or
<strong>merge.tool</strong> depending on the presence of a <strong>DISPLAY</strong> environment
variable value. The default is <strong>false</strong>, where the <strong>–gui</strong> argument must
be provided explicitly for the <strong>merge.guitool</strong> to be used.</p>

<p>
notes.mergeStrategy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which merge strategy to choose by default when resolving notes
conflicts. Must be one of <strong>manual</strong>, <strong>ours</strong>, <strong>theirs</strong>, <strong>union</strong>, or

*git-notes*(1) for more information on the available strategies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
notes.displayRef</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which ref (or refs, if a glob or specified more than once), in addition
to the default set by <strong>core.notesRef</strong> or <strong>GIT_NOTES_REF</strong>, to read notes
from when showing commit messages with the <em>git log</em> family of commands.</p>
<p>
This setting can be overridden with the <strong>GIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF</strong>
environment variable, which must be a colon separated list of refs or
globs.</p>
<p>
A warning will be issued for refs that do not exist, but a glob that
does not match any refs is silently ignored.</p>
<p>
This setting can be disabled by the <strong>–no-notes</strong> option to the <em>git log</em>
family of commands, or by the <strong>–notes=&lt;ref&gt;</strong> option accepted by those
commands.</p>
<p>
The effective value of &#34;core.notesRef&#34; (possibly overridden by

</blockquote>
<p>
notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When rewriting commits with &lt;command&gt; (currently <strong>amend</strong> or <strong>rebase</strong>),
if this variable is <strong>false</strong>, git will not copy notes from the original

Must be one of <strong>overwrite</strong>, <strong>concatenate</strong>, <strong>cat_sort_uniq</strong>, or <strong>ignore</strong>.
Defaults to <strong>concatenate</strong>.</p>
<p>
This setting can be overridden with the <strong>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_MODE</strong>
environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
notes.rewriteRef</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When copying notes during a rewrite, specifies the (fully qualified) ref
whose notes should be copied. May be a glob, in which case notes in all
matching refs will be copied. You may also specify this configuration
several times.</p>
<p>
Does not have a default value; you must configure this variable to
enable note rewriting. Set it to <strong>refs/notes/commits</strong> to enable
rewriting for the default commit notes.</p>
<p>
Can be overridden with the <strong>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF</strong> environment variable.
See <strong>notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;</strong> above for a further description of its

<p>
pack.window</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The size of the window used by *git-pack-objects*(1) when no window size

</blockquote>
<p>
pack.depth</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The maximum delta depth used by *git-pack-objects*(1) when no maximum

is 4095.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pack.windowMemory</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The maximum size of memory that is consumed by each thread in
*git-pack-objects*(1) for pack window memory when no limit is given on
the command line. The value can be suffixed with &#34;k&#34;, &#34;m&#34;, or &#34;g&#34;. When
left unconfigured (or set explicitly to 0), there will be no limit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pack.compression</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An integer -1..9, indicating the compression level for objects in a pack
file. -1 is the zlib default. 0 means no compression, and 1..9 are
various speed/size tradeoffs, 9 being slowest. If not set, defaults to
core.compression. If that is not set, defaults to -1, the zlib default,
which is &#34;a default compromise between speed and compression (currently
equivalent to level 6).&#34;</p>
<p>
Note that changing the compression level will not automatically
recompress all existing objects. You can force recompression by passing
the -F option to *git-repack*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pack.allowPackReuse</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When true or &#34;single&#34;, and when reachability bitmaps are enabled,
pack-objects will try to send parts of the bitmapped packfile verbatim.
When &#34;multi&#34;, and when a multi-pack reachability bitmap is available,
pack-objects will try to send parts of all packs in the MIDX.</p>
<p>
If only a single pack bitmap is available, and <strong>pack.allowPackReuse</strong> is
set to &#34;multi&#34;, reuse parts of just the bitmapped packfile. This can
reduce memory and CPU usage to serve fetches, but might result in
sending a slightly larger pack. Defaults to true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pack.island</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An extended regular expression configuring a set of delta islands. See
&#34;DELTA ISLANDS&#34; in *git-pack-objects*(1) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pack.islandCore</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify an island name which gets to have its objects be packed first.
This creates a kind of pseudo-pack at the front of one pack, so that the
objects from the specified island are hopefully faster to copy into any
pack that should be served to a user requesting these objects. In
practice this means that the island specified should likely correspond
to what is the most commonly cloned in the repo. See also &#34;DELTA
ISLANDS&#34; in *git-pack-objects*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pack.deltaCacheSize</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The maximum memory in bytes used for caching deltas in
*git-pack-objects*(1) before writing them out to a pack. This cache is
used to speed up the writing object phase by not having to recompute the
final delta result once the best match for all objects is found.
Repacking large repositories on machines which are tight with memory
might be badly impacted by this though, especially if this cache pushes
the system into swapping. A value of 0 means no limit. The smallest size
of 1 byte may be used to virtually disable this cache. Defaults to 256
MiB.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pack.deltaCacheLimit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The maximum size of a delta, that is cached in *git-pack-objects*(1).
This cache is used to speed up the writing object phase by not having to
recompute the final delta result once the best match for all objects is
found. Defaults to 1000. Maximum value is 65535.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pack.threads</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the number of threads to spawn when searching for best delta
matches. This requires that *git-pack-objects*(1) be compiled with
pthreads otherwise this option is ignored with a warning. This is meant
to reduce packing time on multiprocessor machines. The required amount
of memory for the delta search window is however multiplied by the
number of threads. Specifying 0 will cause Git to auto-detect the number
of CPUs and set the number of threads accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pack.indexVersion</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the default pack index version. Valid values are 1 for legacy
pack index used by Git versions prior to 1.5.2, and 2 for the new pack
index with capabilities for packs larger than 4 GB as well as proper
protection against the repacking of corrupted packs. Version 2 is the
default. Note that version 2 is enforced and this config option is
ignored whenever the corresponding pack is larger than 2 GB.</p>
<p>
If you have an old Git that does not understand the version 2 <strong>*.idx</strong>
file, cloning or fetching over a non-native protocol (e.g. &#34;http&#34;) that
will copy both <strong>*.pack</strong> file and corresponding <strong>*.idx</strong> file from the
other side may give you a repository that cannot be accessed with your
older version of Git. If the <strong>*.pack</strong> file is smaller than 2 GB,
however, you can use <strong>git-index-pack*(1) on the *.pack file to
regenerate the *</strong>.idx* file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pack.packSizeLimit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The maximum size of a pack. This setting only affects packing to a file
when repacking, i.e. the git:// protocol is unaffected. It can be
overridden by the <strong>–max-pack-size</strong> option of *git-repack*(1). Reaching
this limit results in the creation of multiple packfiles.</p>
<p>
Note that this option is rarely useful, and may result in a larger total
on-disk size (because Git will not store deltas between packs) and worse
runtime performance (object lookup within multiple packs is slower than
a single pack, and optimizations like reachability bitmaps cannot cope
with multiple packs).</p>
<p>
If you need to actively run Git using smaller packfiles (e.g., because
your filesystem does not support large files), this option may help. But
if your goal is to transmit a packfile over a medium that supports
limited sizes (e.g., removable media that cannot store the whole
repository), you are likely better off creating a single large packfile
and splitting it using a generic multi-volume archive tool (e.g., Unix
<strong>split</strong>).</p>
<p>
The minimum size allowed is limited to 1 MiB. The default is unlimited.
Common unit suffixes of <em>k</em>, <em>m</em>, or <em>g</em> are supported.</p>

<p>
pack.useBitmaps</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When true, git will use pack bitmaps (if available) when packing to
stdout (e.g., during the server side of a fetch). Defaults to true. You
should not generally need to turn this off unless you are debugging pack
bitmaps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pack.useBitmapBoundaryTraversal</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When true, Git will use an experimental algorithm for computing
reachability queries with bitmaps. Instead of building up complete
bitmaps for all of the negated tips and then OR-ing them together,
consider negated tips with existing bitmaps as additive (i.e. OR-ing
them into the result if they exist, ignoring them otherwise), and build
up a bitmap at the boundary instead.</p>
<p>
When using this algorithm, Git may include too many objects as a result
of not opening up trees belonging to certain UNINTERESTING commits. This
inexactness matches the non-bitmap traversal algorithm.</p>
<p>
In many cases, this can provide a speed-up over the exact algorithm,
particularly when there is poor bitmap coverage of the negated side of
the query.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pack.useSparse</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When true, git will default to using the <em>–sparse</em> option in <em>git
pack-objects</em> when the <em>–revs</em> option is present. This algorithm only
walks trees that appear in paths that introduce new objects. This can
have significant performance benefits when computing a pack to send a
small change. However, it is possible that extra objects are added to
the pack-file if the included commits contain certain types of direct
renames. Default is <strong>true</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pack.preferBitmapTips</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When selecting which commits will receive bitmaps, prefer a commit at
the tip of any reference that is a suffix of any value of this
configuration over any other commits in the &#34;selection window&#34;.</p>
<p>
Note that setting this configuration to <strong>refs/foo</strong> does not mean that
the commits at the tips of <strong>refs/foo/bar</strong> and <strong>refs/foo/baz</strong> will
necessarily be selected. This is because commits are selected for
bitmaps from within a series of windows of variable length.</p>
<p>
If a commit at the tip of any reference which is a suffix of any value
of this configuration is seen in a window, it is immediately given
preference over any other commit in that window.</p>

pack.writeBitmaps (deprecated)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a deprecated synonym for <strong>repack.writeBitmaps</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pack.writeBitmapHashCache</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When true, git will include a &#34;hash cache&#34; section in the bitmap index
(if one is written). This cache can be used to feed git&#39;s delta
heuristics, potentially leading to better deltas between bitmapped and
non-bitmapped objects (e.g., when serving a fetch between an older,
bitmapped pack and objects that have been pushed since the last gc). The
downside is that it consumes 4 bytes per object of disk space. Defaults
to true.</p>
<p>
When writing a multi-pack reachability bitmap, no new namehashes are
computed; instead, any namehashes stored in an existing bitmap are
permuted into their appropriate location when writing a new bitmap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pack.writeBitmapLookupTable</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When true, Git will include a &#34;lookup table&#34; section in the bitmap index
(if one is written). This table is used to defer loading individual
bitmaps as late as possible. This can be beneficial in repositories that
have relatively large bitmap indexes. Defaults to false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
pack.readReverseIndex</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When true, git will read any .rev file(s) that may be available (see:

</blockquote>
<p>
pack.writeReverseIndex</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When true, git will write a corresponding .rev file (see:
*gitformat-pack*(5)) for each new packfile that it writes in all places

Defaults to true.</p>

effect with push.default options <em>simple</em>, <em>upstream</em>, and <em>current</em>. It
is useful if by default you want new branches to be pushed to the
default remote (like the behavior of <em>push.default=current</em>) and you
also want the upstream tracking to be set. Workflows most likely to
benefit from this option are <em>simple</em> central workflows where all
branches are expected to have the same name on the remote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
push.default</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defines the action <strong>git push</strong> should take if no refspec is given
(whether from the command-line, config, or elsewhere). Different values
are well-suited for specific workflows; for instance, in a purely
central workflow (i.e. the fetch source is equal to the push
destination), <strong>upstream</strong> is probably what you want. Possible values are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>nothing</strong> - do not push anything (error out) unless a refspec is given.
This is primarily meant for people who want to avoid mistakes by always
being explicit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>current</strong> - push the current branch to update a branch with the same
name on the receiving end. Works in both central and non-central
workflows.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>upstream</strong> - push the current branch back to the branch whose changes
are usually integrated into the current branch (which is called
<strong>@{upstream}</strong>). This mode only makes sense if you are pushing to the
same repository you would normally pull from (i.e. central workflow).</p>

<p>
<strong>tracking</strong> - This is a deprecated synonym for <strong>upstream</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>simple</strong> - push the current branch with the same name on the remote.</p>
<p>
If you are working on a centralized workflow (pushing to the same
repository you pull from, which is typically <strong>origin</strong>), then you need to
configure an upstream branch with the same name.</p>
<p>
This mode is the default since Git 2.0, and is the safest option suited
for beginners.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>matching</strong> - push all branches having the same name on both ends. This
makes the repository you are pushing to remember the set of branches
that will be pushed out (e.g. if you always push <em>maint</em> and <em>master</em>
there and no other branches, the repository you push to will have these
two branches, and your local <em>maint</em> and <em>master</em> will be pushed there).</p>
<p>
To use this mode effectively, you have to make sure <em>all</em> the branches
you would push out are ready to be pushed out before running <em>git push</em>,
as the whole point of this mode is to allow you to push all of the
branches in one go. If you usually finish work on only one branch and
push out the result, while other branches are unfinished, this mode is
not for you. Also this mode is not suitable for pushing into a shared
central repository, as other people may add new branches there, or
update the tip of existing branches outside your control.</p>

This used to be the default, but not since Git 2.0 (<strong>simple</strong> is the new
default).</p>

causes all pushes to be GPG signed, as if <strong>–signed</strong> is passed to
<strong>git-push*(1). The string <em>if-asked</em> causes pushes to be signed if the
server supports it, as if *–signed=if-asked</strong> is passed to <em>git push</em>. A
false value may override a value from a lower-priority config file. An

<p>
push.pushOption</p>
<blockquote>

<strong>–push-option=&lt;value&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>
This is a multi-valued variable, and an empty value can be used in a
higher priority configuration file (e.g. <strong>.git/config</strong> in a repository)
to clear the values inherited from a lower priority configuration files
(e.g. <strong>$HOME/.gitconfig</strong>).</p>
<blockquote>

<strong>receive.keepAlive</strong> seconds, it will send a short keepalive packet. The
default is 5 seconds; set to 0 to disable keepalives entirely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
receive.unpackLimit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the number of objects received in a push is below this limit then the
objects will be unpacked into loose object files. However if the number
of received objects equals or exceeds this limit then the received pack
will be stored as a pack, after adding any missing delta bases. Storing
the pack from a push can make the push operation complete faster,
especially on slow filesystems. If not set, the value of
<strong>transfer.unpackLimit</strong> is used instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
receive.maxInputSize</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the size of the incoming pack stream is larger than this limit, then
git-receive-pack will error out, instead of accepting the pack file. If

</blockquote>
<p>
receive.denyDeletes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to true, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update that deletes the
ref. Use this to prevent such a ref deletion via a push.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
receive.denyDeleteCurrent</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to true, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update that deletes the
currently checked out branch of a non-bare repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
receive.denyCurrentBranch</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to true or &#34;refuse&#34;, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update to
the currently checked out branch of a non-bare repository. Such a push
is potentially dangerous because it brings the HEAD out of sync with the
index and working tree. If set to &#34;warn&#34;, print a warning of such a push
to stderr, but allow the push to proceed. If set to false or &#34;ignore&#34;,
allow such pushes with no message. Defaults to &#34;refuse&#34;.</p>
<p>
Another option is &#34;updateInstead&#34; which will update the working tree if
pushing into the current branch. This option is intended for
synchronizing working directories when one side is not easily accessible
via interactive ssh (e.g. a live web site, hence the requirement that
the working directory be clean). This mode also comes in handy when
developing inside a VM to test and fix code on different Operating
Systems.</p>
<p>
By default, &#34;updateInstead&#34; will refuse the push if the working tree or
the index have any difference from the HEAD, but the <strong>push-to-checkout</strong>
hook can be used to customize this. See *githooks*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
receive.denyNonFastForwards</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to true, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update which is not a
fast-forward. Use this to prevent such an update via a push, even if
that push is forced. This configuration variable is set when
initializing a shared repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
receive.hideRefs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This variable is the same as <strong>transfer.hideRefs</strong>, but applies only to
<strong>receive-pack</strong> (and so affects pushes, but not fetches). An attempt to
update or delete a hidden ref by <strong>git push</strong> is rejected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
receive.procReceiveRefs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a multi-valued variable that defines reference prefixes to match
the commands in <strong>receive-pack</strong>. Commands matching the prefixes will be
executed by an external hook &#34;proc-receive&#34;, instead of the internal
<strong>execute_commands</strong> function. If this variable is not defined, the
&#34;proc-receive&#34; hook will never be used, and all commands will be
executed by the internal <strong>execute_commands</strong> function.</p>
<p>
For example, if this variable is set to &#34;refs/for&#34;, pushing to reference
such as &#34;refs/for/master&#34; will not create or update a reference named
&#34;refs/for/master&#34;, but may create or update a pull request directly by
running the hook &#34;proc-receive&#34;.</p>
<p>
Optional modifiers can be provided in the beginning of the value to
filter commands for specific actions: create (a), modify (m), delete
(d). A <strong>!</strong> can be included in the modifiers to negate the reference
prefix entry. E.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git config --system --add receive.procReceiveRefs ad:refs/heads
git config --system --add receive.procReceiveRefs !:refs/heads
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
receive.updateServerInfo</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to true, git-receive-pack will run git-update-server-info after
receiving data from git-push and updating refs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
receive.shallowUpdate</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to true, .git/shallow can be updated when new refs require new
shallow roots. Otherwise those refs are rejected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
reftable.blockSize</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The size in bytes used by the reftable backend when writing blocks. The
block size is determined by the writer, and does not have to be a power
of 2. The block size must be larger than the longest reference name or
log entry used in the repository, as references cannot span blocks.</p>
<p>
Powers of two that are friendly to the virtual memory system or
filesystem (such as 4kB or 8kB) are recommended. Larger sizes (64kB) can
yield better compression, with a possible increased cost incurred by
readers during access.</p>
<p>
The largest block size is <strong>16777215</strong> bytes (15.99 MiB). The default
value is <strong>4096</strong> bytes (4kB). A value of <strong>0</strong> will use the default value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
reftable.restartInterval</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The interval at which to create restart points. The reftable backend
determines the restart points at file creation. Every 16 may be more
suitable for smaller block sizes (4k or 8k), every 64 for larger block
sizes (64k).</p>
<p>
More frequent restart points reduces prefix compression and increases
space consumed by the restart table, both of which increase file size.</p>
<p>
Less frequent restart points makes prefix compression more effective,
decreasing overall file size, with increased penalties for readers
walking through more records after the binary search step.</p>
<p>
A maximum of <strong>65535</strong> restart points per block is supported.</p>
<p>
The default value is to create restart points every 16 records. A value
of <strong>0</strong> will use the default value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
reftable.indexObjects</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether the reftable backend shall write object blocks. Object blocks
are a reverse mapping of object ID to the references pointing to them.</p>
<p>
The default value is <strong>true</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
reftable.geometricFactor</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever the reftable backend appends a new table to the stack, it
performs auto compaction to ensure that there is only a handful of
tables. The backend does this by ensuring that tables form a geometric
sequence regarding the respective sizes of each table.</p>
<p>
By default, the geometric sequence uses a factor of 2, meaning that for
any table, the next-biggest table must at least be twice as big. A
maximum factor of 256 is supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
remote.pushDefault</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The remote to push to by default. Overrides <strong>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</strong> for

string clears the list of urls, allowing you to override earlier config.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
remote.&lt;name&gt;.pushurl</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The push URL of a remote repository. See <strong>git-push*(1). If a *pushurl</strong>

<p>
remote.&lt;name&gt;.tagOpt</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Setting this value to –no-tags disables automatic tag following when
fetching from remote &lt;name&gt;. Setting it to –tags will fetch every tag
from remote &lt;name&gt;, even if they are not reachable from remote branch
heads. Passing these flags directly to *git-fetch*(1) can override this
setting. See options –tags and –no-tags of *git-fetch*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

<strong>fetch.prune</strong> settings, if any.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
remote.&lt;name&gt;.pruneTags</p>
<blockquote>

repack.useDeltaBaseOffset</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, *git-repack*(1) creates packs that use delta-base offset. If
you need to share your repository with Git older than version 1.4.4,
either directly or via a dumb protocol such as http, then you need to
set this option to &#34;false&#34; and repack. Access from old Git versions over
the native protocol are unaffected by this option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
repack.packKeptObjects</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If set to true, makes <strong>git repack</strong> act as if <strong>–pack-kept-objects</strong> was

</blockquote>
<p>
repack.writeBitmaps</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When true, git will write a bitmap index when packing all objects to
disk (e.g., when <strong>git repack -a</strong> is run). This index can speed up the
&#34;counting objects&#34; phase of subsequent packs created for clones and
fetches, at the cost of some disk space and extra time spent on the
initial repack. This has no effect if multiple packfiles are created.
Defaults to true on bare repos, false otherwise.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
revert.reference</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Setting this variable to true makes <strong>git revert</strong> behave as if the
<strong>–reference</strong> option is given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
safe.bareRepository</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies which bare repositories Git will work with. The currently
supported values are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>all</strong>: Git works with all bare repositories. This is the default.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>explicit</strong>: Git only works with bare repositories specified via the
top-level <strong>–git-dir</strong> command-line option, or the <strong>GIT_DIR</strong> environment
variable (see *git*(1)).</p>
<p>
If you do not use bare repositories in your workflow, then it may be
beneficial to set <strong>safe.bareRepository</strong> to <strong>explicit</strong> in your global
config. This will protect you from attacks that involve cloning a
repository that contains a bare repository and running a Git command
within that directory.</p>
<p>
This config setting is only respected in protected configuration (see
the section called “SCOPES”). This prevents untrusted repositories from
tampering with this value.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
safe.directory</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These config entries specify Git-tracked directories that are considered
safe even if they are owned by someone other than the current user. By
default, Git will refuse to even parse a Git config of a repository
owned by someone else, let alone run its hooks, and this config setting
allows users to specify exceptions, e.g. for intentionally shared
repositories (see the <strong>–shared</strong> option in *git-init*(1)).</p>
<p>
This is a multi-valued setting, i.e. you can add more than one directory
via <strong>git config –add</strong>. To reset the list of safe directories (e.g. to
override any such directories specified in the system config), add a
<strong>safe.directory</strong> entry with an empty value.</p>
<p>
This config setting is only respected in protected configuration (see
the section called “SCOPES”). This prevents untrusted repositories from
tampering with this value.</p>
<p>
The value of this setting is interpolated, i.e. <strong>~/&lt;path&gt;</strong> expands to a
path relative to the home directory and <strong>%(prefix)/&lt;path&gt;</strong> expands to a
path relative to Git&#39;s (runtime) prefix.</p>
<p>
To completely opt-out of this security check, set <strong>safe.directory</strong> to
the string <strong>*</strong>. This will allow all repositories to be treated as if
their directory was listed in the <strong>safe.directory</strong> list. If
<strong>safe.directory=*</strong> is set in system config and you want to re-enable
this protection, then initialize your list with an empty value before
listing the repositories that you deem safe. Giving a directory with
<strong>/*</strong> appended to it will allow access to all repositories under the
named directory.</p>
<p>
As explained, Git only allows you to access repositories owned by
yourself, i.e. the user who is running Git, by default. When Git is
running as <em>root</em> in a non Windows platform that provides sudo, however,
git checks the SUDO_UID environment variable that sudo creates and will
allow access to the uid recorded as its value in addition to the id from
<em>root</em>. This is to make it easy to perform a common sequence during
installation &#34;make &amp;&amp; sudo make install&#34;. A git process running under
<em>sudo</em> runs as <em>root</em> but the <em>sudo</em> command exports the environment
variable to record which id the original user has. If that is not what
you would prefer and want git to only trust repositories that are owned
by root instead, then you can remove the <strong>SUDO_UID</strong> variable from root&#39;s
environment before invoking git.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
sparse.expectFilesOutsideOfPatterns</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Typically with sparse checkouts, files not matching any sparsity
patterns are marked with a SKIP_WORKTREE bit in the index and are
missing from the working tree. Accordingly, Git will ordinarily check
whether files with the SKIP_WORKTREE bit are in fact present in the
working tree contrary to expectations. If Git finds any, it marks those
paths as present by clearing the relevant SKIP_WORKTREE bits. This
option can be used to tell Git that such present-despite-skipped files
are expected and to stop checking for them.</p>
<p>
The default is <strong>false</strong>, which allows Git to automatically recover from
the list of files in the index and working tree falling out of sync.</p>
<p>
Set this to <strong>true</strong> if you are in a setup where some external factor
relieves Git of the responsibility for maintaining the consistency
between the presence of working tree files and sparsity patterns. For
example, if you have a Git-aware virtual file system that has a robust
mechanism for keeping the working tree and the sparsity patterns up to
date based on access patterns.</p>
<p>
Regardless of this setting, Git does not check for
present-despite-skipped files unless sparse checkout is enabled, so this
config option has no effect unless <strong>core.sparseCheckout</strong> is <strong>true</strong>.</p>

splitIndex.maxPercentChange</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the split index feature is used, this specifies the percent of

index is written. The value should be between 0 and 100. If the value is
0, then a new shared index is always written; if it is 100, a new shared
index is never written. By default, the value is 20, so a new shared
index is written if the number of entries in the split index would be
greater than 20 percent of the total number of entries. See
*git-update-index*(1).</p>

splitIndex.sharedIndexExpire</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the split index feature is used, shared index files that were not

immediately, and &#34;never&#34; suppresses expiration altogether. The default
value is &#34;2.weeks.ago&#34;. Note that a shared index file is considered
modified (for the purpose of expiration) each time a new split-index
file is either created based on it or read from it. See
*git-update-index*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
ssh.variant</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, Git determines the command line arguments to use based on
the basename of the configured SSH command (configured using the
environment variable <strong>GIT_SSH</strong> or <strong>GIT_SSH_COMMAND</strong> or the config
setting <strong>core.sshCommand</strong>). If the basename is unrecognized, Git will
attempt to detect support of OpenSSH options by first invoking the
configured SSH command with the <strong>-G</strong> (print configuration) option and
will subsequently use OpenSSH options (if that is successful) or no
options besides the host and remote command (if it fails).</p>
<p>
The config variable <strong>ssh.variant</strong> can be set to override this detection.
Valid values are <strong>ssh</strong> (to use OpenSSH options), <strong>plink</strong>, <strong>putty</strong>,
<strong>tortoiseplink</strong>, <strong>simple</strong> (no options except the host and remote
command). The default auto-detection can be explicitly requested using
the value <strong>auto</strong>. Any other value is treated as <strong>ssh</strong>. This setting can
also be overridden via the environment variable <strong>GIT_SSH_VARIANT</strong>.</p>
<p>
The current command-line parameters used for each variant are as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>ssh</strong> - [-p port] [-4] [-6] [-o option] [username@]host command</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>tortoiseplink</strong> - [-P port] [-4] [-6] -batch [username@]host command</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If set to true, *git-status*(1) will display the number of entries
currently stashed away. Defaults to false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
status.showUntrackedFiles</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, *git-status*(1) and *git-commit*(1) show files which are not
currently tracked by Git. Directories which contain only untracked
files, are shown with the directory name only. Showing untracked files
means that Git needs to lstat() all the files in the whole repository,
which might be slow on some systems. So, this variable controls how the
commands display the untracked files. Possible values are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>no</strong> - Show no untracked files.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>normal</strong> - Show untracked files and directories.</p>

spellings for Boolean value <strong>true</strong> are taken as <strong>normal</strong> and <strong>false</strong> as
<strong>no</strong>. This variable can be overridden with the -u|–untracked-files
option of *git-status*(1) and *git-commit*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
status.submoduleSummary</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defaults to false. If this is set to a non-zero number or true
(identical to -1 or an unlimited number), the submodule summary will be
enabled and a summary of commits for modified submodules will be shown
(see –summary-limit option of *git-submodule*(1)). Please note that the
summary output command will be suppressed for all submodules when
<strong>diff.ignoreSubmodules</strong> is set to <em>all</em> or only for those submodules
where <strong>submodule.&lt;name&gt;.ignore=all</strong>. The only exception to that rule is
that status and commit will show staged submodule changes. To also view
the summary for ignored submodules you can either use the
–ignore-submodules=dirty command-line option or the <em>git submodule
summary</em> command, which shows a similar output but does not honor these
settings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
submodule.&lt;name&gt;.url</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The URL for a submodule. This variable is copied from the .gitmodules
file to the git config via <em>git submodule init</em>. The user can change the
configured URL before obtaining the submodule via <em>git submodule
update</em>. If neither submodule.&lt;name&gt;.active nor submodule.active are
set, the presence of this variable is used as a fallback to indicate
whether the submodule is of interest to git commands. See
*git-submodule*(1) and *gitmodules*(5) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
submodule.&lt;name&gt;.update</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The method by which a submodule is updated by <em>git submodule update</em>,
which is the only affected command, others such as <em>git checkout
–recurse-submodules</em> are unaffected. It exists for historical reasons,
when <em>git submodule</em> was the only command to interact with submodules;
settings like <strong>submodule.active</strong> and <strong>pull.rebase</strong> are more specific. It
is populated by <strong>git submodule init</strong> from the *gitmodules*(5) file. See
description of <em>update</em> command in *git-submodule*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
submodule.&lt;name&gt;.branch</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The remote branch name for a submodule, used by <strong>git submodule update
–remote</strong>. Set this option to override the value found in the
<strong>.gitmodules</strong> file. See *git-submodule*(1) and *gitmodules*(5) for
details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
submodule.&lt;name&gt;.fetchRecurseSubmodules</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option can be used to control recursive fetching of this submodule.
It can be overridden by using the –[no-]recurse-submodules command-line
option to &#34;git fetch&#34; and &#34;git pull&#34;. This setting will override that
from in the *gitmodules*(5) file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
submodule.&lt;name&gt;.ignore</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defines under what circumstances &#34;git status&#34; and the diff family show a
submodule as modified. When set to &#34;all&#34;, it will never be considered
modified (but it will nonetheless show up in the output of status and
commit when it has been staged), &#34;dirty&#34; will ignore all changes to the
submodule&#39;s work tree and takes only differences between the HEAD of the
submodule and the commit recorded in the superproject into account.
&#34;untracked&#34; will additionally let submodules with modified tracked files
in their work tree show up. Using &#34;none&#34; (the default when this option
is not set) also shows submodules that have untracked files in their
work tree as changed. This setting overrides any setting made in
.gitmodules for this submodule, both settings can be overridden on the
command line by using the &#34;–ignore-submodules&#34; option. The <em>git
submodule</em> commands are not affected by this setting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
submodule.&lt;name&gt;.active</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boolean value indicating if the submodule is of interest to git
commands. This config option takes precedence over the submodule.active
config option. See *gitsubmodules*(7) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
submodule.active</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A repeated field which contains a pathspec used to match against a
submodule&#39;s path to determine if the submodule is of interest to git
commands. See *gitsubmodules*(7) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
submodule.recurse</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean indicating if commands should enable the
<strong>–recurse-submodules</strong> option by default. Defaults to false.</p>
<p>
When set to true, it can be deactivated via the
<strong>–no-recurse-submodules</strong> option. Note that some Git commands lacking
this option may call some of the above commands affected by
<strong>submodule.recurse</strong>; for instance <strong>git remote update</strong> will call <strong>git
fetch</strong> but does not have a <strong>–no-recurse-submodules</strong> option. For these
commands a workaround is to temporarily change the configuration value
by using <strong>git -c submodule.recurse=0</strong>.</p>
<p>
The following list shows the commands that accept <strong>–recurse-submodules</strong>
and whether they are supported by this setting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>checkout</strong>, <strong>fetch</strong>, <strong>grep</strong>, <strong>pull</strong>, <strong>push</strong>, <strong>read-tree</strong>, <strong>reset</strong>,
<strong>restore</strong> and <strong>switch</strong> are always supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>clone</strong> and <strong>ls-files</strong> are not supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>branch</strong> is supported only if <strong>submodule.propagateBranches</strong> is enabled</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
submodule.propagateBranches</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[EXPERIMENTAL] A boolean that enables branching support when using
<strong>–recurse-submodules</strong> or <strong>submodule.recurse=true</strong>. Enabling this will
allow certain commands to accept <strong>–recurse-submodules</strong> and certain
commands that already accept <strong>–recurse-submodules</strong> will now consider
branches. Defaults to false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
submodule.fetchJobs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies how many submodules are fetched/cloned at the same time. A
positive integer allows up to that number of submodules fetched in
parallel. A value of 0 will give some reasonable default. If unset, it
defaults to 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
submodule.alternateLocation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies how the submodules obtain alternates when submodules are
cloned. Possible values are <strong>no</strong>, <strong>superproject</strong>. By default <strong>no</strong> is
assumed, which doesn&#39;t add references. When the value is set to
<strong>superproject</strong> the submodule to be cloned computes its alternates
location relative to the superprojects alternate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
submodule.alternateErrorStrategy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies how to treat errors with the alternates for a submodule as
computed via <strong>submodule.alternateLocation</strong>. Possible values are
<strong>ignore</strong>, <strong>info</strong>, <strong>die</strong>. Default is <strong>die</strong>. Note that if set to <strong>ignore</strong>
or <strong>info</strong>, and if there is an error with the computed alternate, the
clone proceeds as if no alternate was specified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
tag.forceSignAnnotated</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean to specify whether annotated tags created should be GPG
signed. If <strong>–annotate</strong> is specified on the command line, it takes
precedence over this option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
tag.sort</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This variable controls the sort ordering of tags when displayed by
*git-tag*(1). Without the &#34;–sort=&lt;value&gt;&#34; option provided, the value of
this variable will be used as the default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
tag.gpgSign</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean to specify whether all tags should be GPG signed. Use of this
option when running in an automated script can result in a large number
of tags being signed. It is therefore convenient to use an agent to
avoid typing your gpg passphrase several times. Note that this option
doesn&#39;t affect tag signing behavior enabled by &#34;-u &lt;keyid&gt;&#34; or
&#34;–local-user=&lt;keyid&gt;&#34; options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
tar.umask</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This variable can be used to restrict the permission bits of tar archive
entries. The default is 0002, which turns off the world write bit. The
special value &#34;user&#34; indicates that the archiving user&#39;s umask will be
used instead. See umask(2) and *git-archive*(1).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
trace2.configParams</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A comma-separated list of patterns of &#34;important&#34; config settings that
should be recorded in the trace2 output. For example,
<strong>core.</strong>,remote.*.url* would cause the trace2 output to contain events
listing each configured remote. May be overridden by the

</blockquote>
<p>
trace2.envVars</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A comma-separated list of &#34;important&#34; environment variables that should
be recorded in the trace2 output. For example,
<strong>GIT_HTTP_USER_AGENT,GIT_CONFIG</strong> would cause the trace2 output to
contain events listing the overrides for HTTP user agent and the
location of the Git configuration file (assuming any are set). May be
overridden by the <strong>GIT_TRACE2_ENV_VARS</strong> environment variable. Unset by
default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
trace2.destinationDebug</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boolean. When true Git will print error messages when a trace target
destination cannot be opened for writing. By default, these errors are
suppressed and tracing is silently disabled. May be overridden by the
<strong>GIT_TRACE2_DST_DEBUG</strong> environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
trace2.maxFiles</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Integer. When writing trace files to a target directory, do not write
additional traces if doing so would exceed this many files. Instead,
write a sentinel file that will block further tracing to this directory.
Defaults to 0, which disables this check.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
transfer.credentialsInUrl</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A configured URL can contain plaintext credentials in the form
<strong>&lt;protocol&gt;://&lt;user&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;domain&gt;/&lt;path&gt;</strong>. You may want to warn
or forbid the use of such configuration (in favor of using
*git-credential*(1)). This will be used on *git-clone*(1),
*git-fetch*(1), *git-push*(1), and any other direct use of the
configured URL.</p>
<p>
Note that this is currently limited to detecting credentials in
<strong>remote.&lt;name&gt;.url</strong> configuration; it won&#39;t detect credentials in
<strong>remote.&lt;name&gt;.pushurl</strong> configuration.</p>
<p>
You might want to enable this to prevent inadvertent credentials
exposure, e.g. because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
The OS or system where you&#39;re running git may not provide a way or
otherwise allow you to configure the permissions of the configuration
file where the username and/or password are stored.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Even if it does, having such data stored &#34;at rest&#34; might expose you in
other ways, e.g. a backup process might copy the data to another system.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
The git programs will pass the full URL to one another as arguments on
the command-line, meaning the credentials will be exposed to other
unprivileged users on systems that allow them to see the full process
list of other users. On linux the &#34;hidepid&#34; setting documented in
procfs(5) allows for configuring this behavior.</p>
<p>
If such concerns don&#39;t apply to you then you probably don&#39;t need to be
concerned about credentials exposure due to storing sensitive data in
git&#39;s configuration files. If you do want to use this, set
<strong>transfer.credentialsInUrl</strong> to one of these values:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>allow</strong> (default): Git will proceed with its activity without warning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>warn</strong>: Git will write a warning message to <strong>stderr</strong> when parsing a URL
with a plaintext credential.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>die</strong>: Git will write a failure message to <strong>stderr</strong> when parsing a URL
with a plaintext credential.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
transfer.fsckObjects</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <strong>fetch.fsckObjects</strong> or <strong>receive.fsckObjects</strong> are not set, the value
of this variable is used instead. Defaults to false.</p>
<p>
When set, the fetch or receive will abort in the case of a malformed
object or a link to a nonexistent object. In addition, various other
issues are checked for, including legacy issues (see <strong>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</strong>),
and potential security issues like the existence of a <strong>.GIT</strong> directory
or a malicious <strong>.gitmodules</strong> file (see the release notes for v2.2.1 and
v2.17.1 for details). Other sanity and security checks may be added in
future releases.</p>
<p>
On the receiving side, failing fsckObjects will make those objects
unreachable, see &#34;QUARANTINE ENVIRONMENT&#34; in *git-receive-pack*(1). On
the fetch side, malformed objects will instead be left unreferenced in
the repository.</p>
<p>
Due to the non-quarantine nature of the <strong>fetch.fsckObjects</strong>
implementation it cannot be relied upon to leave the object store clean
like <strong>receive.fsckObjects</strong> can.</p>
<p>
As objects are unpacked they&#39;re written to the object store, so there
can be cases where malicious objects get introduced even though the
&#34;fetch&#34; failed, only to have a subsequent &#34;fetch&#34; succeed because only
new incoming objects are checked, not those that have already been
written to the object store. That difference in behavior should not be
relied upon. In the future, such objects may be quarantined for &#34;fetch&#34;
as well.</p>
<p>
For now, the paranoid need to find some way to emulate the quarantine
environment if they&#39;d like the same protection as &#34;push&#34;. E.g. in the
case of an internal mirror do the mirroring in two steps, one to fetch
the untrusted objects, and then do a second &#34;push&#34; (which will use the
quarantine) to another internal repo, and have internal clients consume
this pushed-to repository, or embargo internal fetches and only allow
them once a full &#34;fsck&#34; has run (and no new fetches have happened in the
meantime).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
transfer.hideRefs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>String(s) <strong>receive-pack</strong> and <strong>upload-pack</strong> use to decide which refs to
omit from their initial advertisements. Use more than one definition to
specify multiple prefix strings. A ref that is under the hierarchies
listed in the value of this variable is excluded, and is hidden when
responding to <strong>git push</strong> or <strong>git fetch</strong>. See <strong>receive.hideRefs</strong> and
<strong>uploadpack.hideRefs</strong> for program-specific versions of this config.</p>
<p>
You may also include a <strong>!</strong> in front of the ref name to negate the entry,
explicitly exposing it, even if an earlier entry marked it as hidden. If
you have multiple hideRefs values, later entries override earlier ones
(and entries in more-specific config files override less-specific ones).</p>
<p>
If a namespace is in use, the namespace prefix is stripped from each
reference before it is matched against <strong>transfer.hiderefs</strong> patterns. In
order to match refs before stripping, add a <strong>^</strong> in front of the ref
name. If you combine <strong>!</strong> and <strong>^</strong>, <strong>!</strong> must be specified first.</p>
<p>
For example, if <strong>refs/heads/master</strong> is specified in <strong>transfer.hideRefs</strong>
and the current namespace is <strong>foo</strong>, then
<strong>refs/namespaces/foo/refs/heads/master</strong> is omitted from the
advertisements. If <strong>uploadpack.allowRefInWant</strong> is set, <strong>upload-pack</strong>
will treat <strong>want-ref refs/heads/master</strong> in a protocol v2 <strong>fetch</strong> command
as if <strong>refs/namespaces/foo/refs/heads/master</strong> did not exist.
<strong>receive-pack</strong>, on the other hand, will still advertise the object id
the ref is pointing to without mentioning its name (a so-called &#34;.have&#34;
line).</p>
<p>
Even if you hide refs, a client may still be able to steal the target
objects via the techniques described in the &#34;SECURITY&#34; section of the
*gitnamespaces*(7) man page; it&#39;s best to keep private data in a
separate repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
transfer.unpackLimit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <strong>fetch.unpackLimit</strong> or <strong>receive.unpackLimit</strong> are not set, the value
of this variable is used instead. The default value is 100.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
transfer.advertiseSID</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boolean. When true, client and server processes will advertise their
unique session IDs to their remote counterpart. Defaults to false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
transfer.bundleURI</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <strong>true</strong>, local <strong>git clone</strong> commands will request bundle information
from the remote server (if advertised) and download bundles before
continuing the clone through the Git protocol. Defaults to <strong>false</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
transfer.advertiseObjectInfo</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <strong>true</strong>, the <strong>object-info</strong> capability is advertised by servers.
Defaults to false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
uploadarchive.allowUnreachable</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, allow clients to use <strong>git archive –remote</strong> to request any
tree, whether reachable from the ref tips or not. See the discussion in
the &#34;SECURITY&#34; section of <strong>git-upload-archive*(1) for more details.
Defaults to *false</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
uploadpack.hideRefs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This variable is the same as <strong>transfer.hideRefs</strong>, but applies only to
<strong>upload-pack</strong> (and so affects only fetches, not pushes). An attempt to
fetch a hidden ref by <strong>git fetch</strong> will fail. See also
<strong>uploadpack.allowTipSHA1InWant</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
uploadpack.allowTipSHA1InWant</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <strong>uploadpack.hideRefs</strong> is in effect, allow <strong>upload-pack</strong> to accept a
fetch request that asks for an object at the tip of a hidden ref (by
default, such a request is rejected). See also <strong>uploadpack.hideRefs</strong>.
Even if this is false, a client may be able to steal objects via the
techniques described in the &#34;SECURITY&#34; section of the *gitnamespaces*(7)
man page; it&#39;s best to keep private data in a separate repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
uploadpack.allowReachableSHA1InWant</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow <strong>upload-pack</strong> to accept a fetch request that asks for an object
that is reachable from any ref tip. However, note that calculating
object reachability is computationally expensive. Defaults to <strong>false</strong>.
Even if this is false, a client may be able to steal objects via the
techniques described in the &#34;SECURITY&#34; section of the *gitnamespaces*(7)
man page; it&#39;s best to keep private data in a separate repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
uploadpack.allowAnySHA1InWant</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow <strong>upload-pack</strong> to accept a fetch request that asks for any object
at all. Defaults to <strong>false</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
uploadpack.keepAlive</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <strong>upload-pack</strong> has started <strong>pack-objects</strong>, there may be a quiet
period while <strong>pack-objects</strong> prepares the pack. Normally it would output
progress information, but if <strong>–quiet</strong> was used for the fetch,
<strong>pack-objects</strong> will output nothing at all until the pack data begins.
Some clients and networks may consider the server to be hung and give
up. Setting this option instructs <strong>upload-pack</strong> to send an empty
keepalive packet every <strong>uploadpack.keepAlive</strong> seconds. Setting this
option to 0 disables keepalive packets entirely. The default is 5
seconds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
uploadpack.packObjectsHook</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this option is set, when <strong>upload-pack</strong> would run <strong>git pack-objects</strong>
to create a packfile for a client, it will run this shell command
instead. The <strong>pack-objects</strong> command and arguments it <em>would</em> have run
(including the <strong>git pack-objects</strong> at the beginning) are appended to the
shell command. The stdin and stdout of the hook are treated as if
<strong>pack-objects</strong> itself was run. I.e., <strong>upload-pack</strong> will feed input
intended for <strong>pack-objects</strong> to the hook, and expects a completed
packfile on stdout.</p>
<p>
Note that this configuration variable is only respected when it is
specified in protected configuration (see the section called “SCOPES”).
This is a safety measure against fetching from untrusted repositories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
uploadpack.allowFilter</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this option is set, <strong>upload-pack</strong> will support partial clone and
partial fetch object filtering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
uploadpackfilter.allow</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provides a default value for unspecified object filters (see: the below
configuration variable). If set to <strong>true</strong>, this will also enable all
filters which get added in the future. Defaults to <strong>true</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
uploadpackfilter.&lt;filter&gt;.allow</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explicitly allow or ban the object filter corresponding to <strong>&lt;filter&gt;</strong>,
where <strong>&lt;filter&gt;</strong> may be one of: <strong>blob:none</strong>, <strong>blob:limit</strong>,
<strong>object:type</strong>, <strong>tree</strong>, <strong>sparse:oid</strong>, or <strong>combine</strong>. If using combined
filters, both <strong>combine</strong> and all of the nested filter kinds must be
allowed. Defaults to <strong>uploadpackfilter.allow</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
uploadpackfilter.tree.maxDepth</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only allow <strong>–filter=tree:&lt;n&gt;</strong> when <strong>&lt;n&gt;</strong> is no more than the value of
<strong>uploadpackfilter.tree.maxDepth</strong>. If set, this also implies
<strong>uploadpackfilter.tree.allow=true</strong>, unless this configuration variable
had already been set. Has no effect if unset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
uploadpack.allowRefInWant</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this option is set, <strong>upload-pack</strong> will support the <strong>ref-in-want</strong>
feature of the protocol version 2 <strong>fetch</strong> command. This feature is
intended for the benefit of load-balanced servers which may not have the
same view of what OIDs their refs point to due to replication delay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
url.&lt;base&gt;.insteadOf</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any URL that starts with this value will be rewritten to start, instead,
with &lt;base&gt;. In cases where some site serves a large number of
repositories, and serves them with multiple access methods, and some
users need to use different access methods, this feature allows people
to specify any of the equivalent URLs and have Git automatically rewrite
the URL to the best alternative for the particular user, even for a
never-before-seen repository on the site. When more than one insteadOf
strings match a given URL, the longest match is used.</p>
<p>
Note that any protocol restrictions will be applied to the rewritten
URL. If the rewrite changes the URL to use a custom protocol or remote
helper, you may need to adjust the <strong>protocol.</strong>.allow* config to permit
the request. In particular, protocols you expect to use for submodules
must be set to <strong>always</strong> rather than the default of <strong>user</strong>. See the
description of <strong>protocol.allow</strong> above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
url.&lt;base&gt;.pushInsteadOf</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any URL that starts with this value will not be pushed to; instead, it
will be rewritten to start with &lt;base&gt;, and the resulting URL will be
pushed to. In cases where some site serves a large number of
repositories, and serves them with multiple access methods, some of
which do not allow push, this feature allows people to specify a
pull-only URL and have Git automatically use an appropriate URL to push,
even for a never-before-seen repository on the site. When more than one
pushInsteadOf strings match a given URL, the longest match is used. If a
remote has an explicit pushurl, Git will ignore this setting for that
remote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
user.name, user.email, author.name, author.email, committer.name,
committer.email</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>user.name</strong> and <strong>user.email</strong> variables determine what ends up in the
<strong>author</strong> and <strong>committer</strong> fields of commit objects. If you need the
<strong>author</strong> or <strong>committer</strong> to be different, the <strong>author.name</strong>,
<strong>author.email</strong>, <strong>committer.name</strong>, or <strong>committer.email</strong> variables can be
set. All of these can be overridden by the <strong>GIT_AUTHOR_NAME</strong>,
<strong>GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL</strong>, <strong>GIT_COMMITTER_NAME</strong>, <strong>GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL</strong>, and
<strong>EMAIL</strong> environment variables.</p>
<p>
Note that the <strong>name</strong> forms of these variables conventionally refer to
some form of a personal name. See *git-commit*(1) and the environment
variables section of <strong>git*(1) for more information on these settings and
the *credential.username</strong> option if you&#39;re looking for authentication
credentials instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
user.useConfigOnly</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instruct Git to avoid trying to guess defaults for <strong>user.email</strong> and
<strong>user.name</strong>, and instead retrieve the values only from the
configuration. For example, if you have multiple email addresses and
would like to use a different one for each repository, then with this
configuration option set to <strong>true</strong> in the global config along with a
name, Git will prompt you to set up an email before making new commits
in a newly cloned repository. Defaults to <strong>false</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
user.signingKey</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If *git-tag*(1) or *git-commit*(1) is not selecting the key you want it
to automatically when creating a signed tag or commit, you can override
the default selection with this variable. This option is passed
unchanged to gpg&#39;s –local-user parameter, so you may specify a key
using any method that gpg supports. If gpg.format is set to <strong>ssh</strong> this
can contain the path to either your private ssh key or the public key
when ssh-agent is used. Alternatively it can contain a public key
prefixed with <strong>key::</strong> directly (e.g.: &#34;key::ssh-rsa XXXXXX identifier&#34;).
The private key needs to be available via ssh-agent. If not set Git will
call gpg.ssh.defaultKeyCommand (e.g.: &#34;ssh-add -L&#34;) and try to use the
first key available. For backward compatibility, a raw key which begins
with &#34;ssh-&#34;, such as &#34;ssh-rsa XXXXXX identifier&#34;, is treated as
&#34;key::ssh-rsa XXXXXX identifier&#34;, but this form is deprecated; use the
<strong>key::</strong> form instead.</p>

<p>
versionsort.prereleaseSuffix (deprecated)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deprecated alias for <strong>versionsort.suffix</strong>. Ignored if
<strong>versionsort.suffix</strong> is set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
versionsort.suffix</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even when version sort is used in *git-tag*(1), tagnames with the same
base version but different suffixes are still sorted lexicographically,
resulting e.g. in prerelease tags appearing after the main release (e.g.
&#34;1.0-rc1&#34; after &#34;1.0&#34;). This variable can be specified to determine the
sorting order of tags with different suffixes.</p>
<p>
By specifying a single suffix in this variable, any tagname containing
that suffix will appear before the corresponding main release. E.g. if
the variable is set to &#34;-rc&#34;, then all &#34;1.0-rcX&#34; tags will appear before
&#34;1.0&#34;. If specified multiple times, once per suffix, then the order of
suffixes in the configuration will determine the sorting order of
tagnames with those suffixes. E.g. if &#34;-pre&#34; appears before &#34;-rc&#34; in the
configuration, then all &#34;1.0-preX&#34; tags will be listed before any
&#34;1.0-rcX&#34; tags. The placement of the main release tag relative to tags
with various suffixes can be determined by specifying the empty suffix
among those other suffixes. E.g. if the suffixes &#34;-rc&#34;, &#34;&#34;, &#34;-ck&#34;, and
&#34;-bfs&#34; appear in the configuration in this order, then all &#34;v4.8-rcX&#34;
tags are listed first, followed by &#34;v4.8&#34;, then &#34;v4.8-ckX&#34; and finally
&#34;v4.8-bfsX&#34;.</p>
<p>
If more than one suffix matches the same tagname, then that tagname will
be sorted according to the suffix which starts at the earliest position
in the tagname. If more than one different matching suffix starts at
that earliest position, then that tagname will be sorted according to
the longest of those suffixes. The sorting order between different
suffixes is undefined if they are in multiple config files.</p>

<p>
web.browser</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify a web browser that may be used by some commands. Currently only
*git-instaweb*(1) and *git-help*(1) may use it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
worktree.guessRemote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If no branch is specified and neither <strong>-b</strong> nor <strong>-B</strong> nor <strong>–detach</strong> is
used, then <strong>git worktree add</strong> defaults to creating a new branch from
HEAD. If <strong>worktree.guessRemote</strong> is set to true, <strong>worktree add</strong> tries to
find a remote-tracking branch whose name uniquely matches the new branch
name. If such a branch exists, it is checked out and set as &#34;upstream&#34;
for the new branch. If no such match can be found, it falls back to
creating a new branch from the current HEAD.</p>

  [section.subsection]
    key = value1
