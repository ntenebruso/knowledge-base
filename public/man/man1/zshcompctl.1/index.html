DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>This version of zsh has two ways of performing completion of words on
the command line. New users of the shell may prefer to use the newer and
more powerful system based on shell functions; this is described in
/zshcompsys/(1), and the basic shell mechanisms which support it are
described in /zshcompwid/(1). This manual entry describes the older
<strong>compctl</strong> command.</p>

</ul>

</dl>
<p>Control the editor&#39;s completion behavior according to the supplied set
of <em>options</em>. Various editing commands, notably
<strong>expand-or-complete-word</strong>, usually bound to tab, will attempt to
complete a word typed by the user, while others, notably
<strong>delete-char-or-list</strong>, usually bound to ^D in EMACS editing mode, list
the possibilities; <strong>compctl</strong> controls what those possibilities are. They
may for example be filenames (the most common case, and hence the
default), shell variables, or words from a user-specified list.</p>

COMMAND FLAGS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Completion of the arguments of a command may be different for each
command or may use the default. The behavior when completing the command
word itself may also be separately specified. These correspond to the
following flags and arguments, all of which (except for <strong>-L</strong>) may be
combined with any combination of the <em>options</em> described subsequently in
the section `Option Flags&#39;:</p>
<p>
<em>command</em> … controls completion for the named commands, which must be
listed last on the command line. If completion is attempted for a
command with a pathname containing slashes and no completion definition
is found, the search is retried with the last pathname component. If the
command starts with a <strong>=</strong>, completion is tried with the pathname of the
command.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any of the <em>command</em> strings may be patterns of the form normally used
for filename generation. These should be quoted to protect them from
immediate expansion; for example the command string <strong>&#39;foo</strong>&#39;* arranges
for completion of the words of any command beginning with <strong>foo</strong>. When
completion is attempted, all pattern completions are tried in the
reverse order of their definition until one matches. By default,
completion then proceeds as normal, i.e. the shell will try to generate
more matches for the specific command on the command line; this can be
overridden by including <strong>-tn</strong> in the flags for the pattern completion.</p>
<p>
Note that aliases are expanded before the command name is determined
unless the <strong>COMPLETE_ALIASES</strong> option is set. Commands may not be
combined with the <strong>-C</strong>, <strong>-D</strong> or <strong>-T</strong> flags.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-C</strong>
</dt>
<dd>controls completion when the command word itself is being
completed. If no <strong>compctl -C</strong> command has been issued, the names of
any executable command (whether in the path or specific to the shell,
such as aliases or functions) are completed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-D</strong>
</dt>
<dd>controls default completion behavior for the arguments of
commands not assigned any special behavior. If no <strong>compctl -D</strong> command
has been issued, filenames are completed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-T</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>supplies completion flags to be used before any other
processing is done, even before processing for *compctl*s defined for
specific commands. This is especially useful when combined with
extended completion (the <strong>-x</strong> flag, see the section `Extended
Completion&#39; below). Using this flag you can define default behavior
which will apply to all commands without exception, or you can alter
the standard behavior for all commands. For example, if your access to
the user database is too slow and/or it contains too many users (so
that completion after `*~*&#39; is too slow to be usable), you can use</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
compctl -T -x &#39;s[~] C[0,[^/]#]&#39; -k friends -S/ -tn
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
to complete the strings in the array <strong>friends</strong> after a `*~*&#39;. The
<strong>C[*/…/*]</strong> argument is necessary so that this form of <strong>~</strong>-completion
is not tried after the directory name is finished.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-L</strong>
</dt>
<dd>lists the existing completion behavior in a manner suitable
for putting into a start-up script; the existing behavior is not
changed. Any combination of the above forms, or the <strong>-M</strong> flag (which
must follow the <strong>-L</strong> flag), may be specified, otherwise all defined
completions are listed. Any other flags supplied are ignored.</dd>
<dt>
<em>no argument</em>
</dt>
<dd>If no argument is given, <strong>compctl</strong> lists all defined
completions in an abbreviated form; with a list of <em>options</em>, all
completions with those flags set (not counting extended completion)
are listed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the <strong>+</strong> flag is alone and followed immediately by the <em>command</em> list,
the completion behavior for all the commands in the list is reset to the
default. In other words, completion will subsequently use the options
specified by the <strong>-D</strong> flag.</p>
<p>
The form with <strong>-M</strong> as the first and only option defines global matching
specifications (see zshcompwid). The match specifications given will be
used for every completion attempt (only when using <strong>compctl</strong>, not with
the new completion system) and are tried in the order in which they are
defined until one generates at least one match. E.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
compctl -M &#39;&#39; &#39;m:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}&#39;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This will first try completion without any global match specifications
(the empty string) and, if that generates no matches, will try case
insensitive completion.</p>

Flags with Arguments
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>These have user supplied arguments to determine how the list of
completions is to be made up:</p>
<p>
<strong>-k</strong> <em>array</em> Names taken from the elements of <strong>$*/array/ (note that the
`*$</strong>&#39; does not appear on the command line). Alternatively, the argument
<em>array</em> itself may be a set of space- or comma-separated values in
parentheses, in which any delimiter may be escaped with a backslash; in
this case the argument should be quoted. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
compctl -k &#34;(cputime filesize datasize stacksize
	       coredumpsize resident descriptors)&#34; limit
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-g</strong> <em>globstring</em>
</dt>
<dd>The <em>globstring</em> is expanded using filename
globbing; it should be quoted to protect it from immediate expansion.
The resulting filenames are taken as the possible completions. Use
`**(/)*&#39; instead of `**/*&#39; for directories. The <strong>fignore</strong> special
parameter is not applied to the resulting files. More than one pattern
may be given separated by blanks. (Note that brace expansion is <em>not</em>
part of globbing. Use the syntax `*(either|or)*&#39; to match
alternatives.)</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-s</strong> <em>subststring</em>
</dt>
<dd>The <em>subststring</em> is split into words and these
words are than expanded using all shell expansion mechanisms (see
/zshexpn/(1)). The resulting words are taken as possible completions.
The <strong>fignore</strong> special parameter is not applied to the resulting files.
Note that <strong>-g</strong> is faster for filenames.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-K</strong> <em>function</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Call the given function to get the completions.
Unless the name starts with an underscore, the function is passed two
arguments: the prefix and the suffix of the word on which completion
is to be attempted, in other words those characters before the cursor
position, and those from the cursor position onwards. The whole
command line can be accessed with the <strong>-c</strong> and <strong>-l</strong> flags of the
<strong>read</strong> builtin. The function should set the variable <strong>reply</strong> to an
array containing the completions (one completion per element); note
that <strong>reply</strong> should not be made local to the function. From such a
function the command line can be accessed with the <strong>-c</strong> and <strong>-l</strong> flags
to the <strong>read</strong> builtin. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
function whoson { reply=(`users`); }
compctl -K whoson talk
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
completes only logged-on users after `*talk*&#39;. Note that `*whoson*&#39;
must return an array, so `*reply=`users`*&#39; would be incorrect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-H</strong> <em>num pattern</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The possible completions are taken from the last
<em>num</em> history lines. Only words matching <em>pattern</em> are taken. If <em>num</em>
is zero or negative the whole history is searched and if <em>pattern</em> is
the empty string all words are taken (as with `***&#39;). A typical use is</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
compctl -D -f + -H 0 &#39;&#39;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
which forces completion to look back in the history list for a word if
no filename matches.</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-7">
Control Flags
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>These do not directly specify types of name to be completed, but
manipulate the options that do:</p>
<p>
<strong>-Q</strong> This instructs the shell not to quote any metacharacters in the
possible completions. Normally the results of a completion are inserted
into the command line with any metacharacters quoted so that they are
interpreted as normal characters. This is appropriate for filenames and
ordinary strings. However, for special effects, such as inserting a
backquoted expression from a completion array (<strong>-k</strong>) so that the
expression will not be evaluated until the complete line is executed,
this option must be used.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-P</strong> <em>prefix</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <em>prefix</em> is inserted just before the completed
string; any initial part already typed will be completed and the whole
<em>prefix</em> ignored for completion purposes. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
compctl -j -P &#34;%&#34; kill
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
inserts a `%&#39; after the kill command and then completes job names.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-S</strong> <em>suffix</em>
</dt>
<dd>When a completion is found the <em>suffix</em> is inserted
after the completed string. In the case of menu completion the suffix
is inserted immediately, but it is still possible to cycle through the
list of completions by repeatedly hitting the same key.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-W</strong> <em>file-prefix</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>With directory <em>file-prefix</em>: for command, file,
directory and globbing completion (options <strong>-c</strong>, <strong>-f</strong>, <strong>-/</strong>, <strong>-g</strong>),
the file prefix is implicitly added in front of the completion. For
example,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
compctl -/ -W ~/Mail maildirs
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
completes any subdirectories to any depth beneath the directory
<strong>~/Mail</strong>, although that prefix does not appear on the command line.
The <em>file-prefix</em> may also be of the form accepted by the <strong>-k</strong> flag,
i.e. the name of an array or a literal list in parenthesis. In this
case all the directories in the list will be searched for possible
completions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-q</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If used with a suffix as specified by the <strong>-S</strong> option, this
causes the suffix to be removed if the next character typed is a blank
or does not insert anything or if the suffix consists of only one
character and the next character typed is the same character; this the
same rule used for the <strong>AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH</strong> option. The option is most
useful for list separators (comma, colon, etc.).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-l</strong> <em>cmd</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option restricts the range of command line words
that are considered to be arguments. If combined with one of the
extended completion patterns `*p[*…*]*&#39;, `*r[*…*]*&#39;, or
`*R[*…*]*&#39; (see the section `Extended Completion&#39; below) the range
is restricted to the range of arguments specified in the brackets.
Completion is then performed as if these had been given as arguments
to the <em>cmd</em> supplied with the option. If the <em>cmd</em> string is empty
the first word in the range is instead taken as the command name, and
command name completion performed on the first word in the range. For
example,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
compctl -x &#39;r[-exec,;]&#39; -l &#39;&#39; -- find
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
completes arguments between `*-exec*&#39; and the following `*;*&#39; (or the
end of the command line if there is no such string) as if they were a
separate command line.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-h</strong> <em>cmd</em>
</dt>
<dd>Normally zsh completes quoted strings as a whole. With
this option, completion can be done separately on different parts of
such strings. It works like the <strong>-l</strong> option but makes the completion
code work on the parts of the current word that are separated by
spaces. These parts are completed as if they were arguments to the
given <em>cmd</em>. If <em>cmd</em> is the empty string, the first part is completed
as a command name, as with <strong>-l</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-U</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use the whole list of possible completions, whether or not
they actually match the word on the command line. The word typed so
far will be deleted. This is most useful with a function (given by the
<strong>-K</strong> option) which can examine the word components passed to it (or
via the <strong>read</strong> builtin&#39;s <strong>-c</strong> and <strong>-l</strong> flags) and use its own criteria
to decide what matches. If there is no completion, the original word
is retained. Since the produced possible completions seldom have
interesting common prefixes and suffixes, menu completion is started
immediately if <strong>AUTO_MENU</strong> is set and this flag is used.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-y</strong> <em>func-or-var</em>
</dt>
<dd>The list provided by <em>func-or-var</em> is displayed
instead of the list of completions whenever a listing is required; the
actual completions to be inserted are not affected. It can be provided
in two ways. Firstly, if <em>func-or-var</em> begins with a <strong>$</strong> it defines a
variable, or if it begins with a left parenthesis a literal array,
which contains the list. A variable may have been set by a call to a
function using the <strong>-K</strong> option. Otherwise it contains the name of a
function which will be executed to create the list. The function will
be passed as an argument list all matching completions, including
prefixes and suffixes expanded in full, and should set the array
<strong>reply</strong> to the result. In both cases, the display list will only be
retrieved after a complete list of matches has been created.

Note that the returned list does not have to correspond, even in
length, to the original set of matches, and may be passed as a scalar
instead of an array. No special formatting of characters is performed
on the output in this case; in particular, newlines are printed
literally and if they appear output in columns is suppressed.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-X</strong> <em>explanation</em>
</dt>
<dd>Print <em>explanation</em> when trying completion on
the current set of options. A `*%n*&#39; in this string is replaced by the
number of matches that were added for this explanation string. The
explanation only appears if completion was tried and there was no
unique match, or when listing completions. Explanation strings will be
listed together with the matches of the group specified together with
the <strong>-X</strong> option (using the <strong>-J</strong> or <strong>-V</strong> option). If the same
explanation string is given to multiple <strong>-X</strong> options, the string
appears only once (for each group) and the number of matches shown for
the `*%n*&#39; is the total number of all matches for each of these uses.
In any case, the explanation string will only be shown if there was at
least one match added for the explanation string.

The sequences <strong>%B</strong>, <strong>%b</strong>, <strong>%S</strong>, <strong>%s</strong>, <strong>%U</strong>, and <strong>%u</strong> specify output
attributes (bold, standout, and underline), <strong>%F</strong>, <strong>%f</strong>, <strong>%K</strong>, <strong>%k</strong>
specify foreground and background colours, and <strong>%{*/…/*%}</strong> can be
used to include literal escape sequences as in prompts.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-Y</strong> <em>explanation</em>
</dt>
<dd>Identical to <strong>-X</strong>, except that the <em>explanation</em>
first undergoes expansion following the usual rules for strings in
double quotes. The expansion will be carried out after any functions
are called for the <strong>-K</strong> or <strong>-y</strong> options, allowing them to set
variables.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-t</strong> <em>continue</em>
</dt>
<dd>The <em>continue</em>-string contains a character that
specifies which set of completion flags should be used next. It is
useful:

(i) With <strong>-T</strong>, or when trying a list of pattern completions, when
<strong>compctl</strong> would usually continue with ordinary processing after
finding matches; this can be suppressed with `*-tn*&#39;.

(ii) With a list of alternatives separated by <strong>+</strong>, when <strong>compctl</strong>
would normally stop when one of the alternatives generates matches. It
can be forced to consider the next set of completions by adding
`*-t+*&#39; to the flags of the alternative before the `*+*&#39;.

(iii) In an extended completion list (see below), when <strong>compctl</strong> would
normally continue until a set of conditions succeeded, then use only
the immediately following flags. With `*-t-<strong>&#39;, *compctl</strong> will continue
trying extended completions after the next `*-<strong>&#39;; with `</strong>-tx*&#39; it will
attempt completion with the default flags, in other words those before
the `*-x*&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-J</strong> <em>name</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This gives the name of the group the matches should be
placed in. Groups are listed and sorted separately; likewise, menu
completion will offer the matches in the groups in the order in which
the groups were defined. If no group name is explicitly given, the
matches are stored in a group named <strong>default</strong>. The first time a group
name is encountered, a group with that name is created. After that all
matches with the same group name are stored in that group.</p>
<p>
This can be useful with non-exclusive alternative completions. For
example, in</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
compctl -f -J files -t+ + -v -J variables foo
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
both files and variables are possible completions, as the <strong>-t+</strong> forces
both sets of alternatives before and after the <strong>+</strong> to be considered at
once. Because of the <strong>-J</strong> options, however, all files are listed
before all variables.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-V</strong> <em>name</em>
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>-J</strong>, but matches within the group will not be
sorted in listings nor in menu completion. These unsorted groups are
in a different name space from the sorted ones, so groups defined as
<strong>-J files</strong> and <strong>-V</strong> files are distinct.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If given together with the <strong>-V</strong> option, makes only consecutive
duplicates in the group be removed. Note that groups with and without
this flag are in different name spaces.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-2</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If given together with the <strong>-J</strong> or <strong>-V</strong> option, makes all
duplicates be kept. Again, groups with and without this flag are in
different name spaces.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-M</strong> <em>match-spec</em>
</dt>
<dd>This defines additional matching control
specifications that should be used only when testing words for the
list of flags this flag appears in. The format of the <em>match-spec</em>
string is described in zshcompwid.</dd>

ALTERNATIVE COMPLETION

</ul>
<p>The form with `*+*&#39; specifies alternative options. Completion is tried
with the options before the first `*+*&#39;. If this produces no matches
completion is tried with the flags after the `*+*&#39; and so on. If there
are no flags after the last `*+*&#39; and a match has not been found up to
that point, default completion is tried. If the list of flags contains a
<strong>-t</strong> with a <strong>+</strong> character, the next list of flags is used even if the
current list produced matches.</p>
<p>
Additional options are available that restrict completion to some part
of the command line; this is referred to as `extended completion&#39;.</p>

EXTENDED COMPLETION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<ul>
<li><strong>compctl *[ *-CDT</strong> ] <em>options</em> <strong>-x</strong> <em>pattern</em> <em>options</em> <strong>-</strong> …
<strong>–</strong> :: - * <strong>[ <em>command</em> … ] :: - *compctl *[ *-CDT</strong> ] <em>options</em> [
    <strong>-x</strong> <em>pattern</em> <em>options</em> <strong>-</strong> … <strong>–</strong> ] :: - * <strong>[ *+</strong> <em>options</em> [
      <strong>-x</strong> … <strong>–</strong> ] … [*+*] ] [ <em>command</em> … ] :: </li>
</ul>
<p>The form with `*-x*&#39; specifies extended completion for the commands
given; as shown, it may be combined with alternative completion using
`*+*&#39;. Each <em>pattern</em> is examined in turn; when a match is found, the
corresponding <em>options</em>, as described in the section `Option Flags&#39;
above, are used to generate possible completions. If no <em>pattern</em>
matches, the <em>options</em> given before the <strong>-x</strong> are used.</p>
<p>
Note that each pattern should be supplied as a single argument and
should be quoted to prevent expansion of metacharacters by the shell.</p>
<p>
A <em>pattern</em> is built of sub-patterns separated by commas; it matches if
at least one of these sub-patterns matches (they are `or&#39;ed). These
sub-patterns are in turn composed of other sub-patterns separated by
white spaces which match if all of the sub-patterns match (they are
`and&#39;ed). An element of the sub-patterns is of the form
`/c/*[*…*][*…*]*&#39;, where the pairs of brackets may be repeated as
often as necessary, and matches if any of the sets of brackets match (an
`or&#39;). The example below makes this clearer.</p>
<p>
The elements may be any of the following:</p>
<p>
<strong>s[*/string/*]</strong>… Matches if the current word on the command line
starts with one of the strings given in brackets. The <em>string</em> is not
removed and is not part of the completion.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>S[*/string/*]</strong>…
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>s[*/string/*]</strong> except that the <em>string</em> is
part of the completion.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>p[*/from/</strong>,*/to/*]*…
</dt>
<dd>Matches if the number of the current word
is between one of the <em>from</em> and <em>to</em> pairs inclusive. The comma and
<em>to</em> are optional; <em>to</em> defaults to the same value as <em>from</em>. The
numbers may be negative: *-*/n/ refers to the <em>n</em>&#39;th last word on the
line.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>c[*/offset/</strong>,*/string/*]*…
</dt>
<dd>Matches if the <em>string</em> matches the
word offset by <em>offset</em> from the current word position. Usually
<em>offset</em> will be negative.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>C[*/offset/</strong>,*/pattern/*]*…
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>c</strong> but using pattern matching
instead.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>w[*/index/</strong>,*/string/*]*…
</dt>
<dd>Matches if the word in position
<em>index</em> is equal to the corresponding <em>string</em>. Note that the word
count is made after any alias expansion.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>W[*/index/</strong>,*/pattern/*]*…
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>w</strong> but using pattern matching
instead.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>n[*/index/</strong>,*/string/*]*…
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches if the current word contains
<em>string</em>. Anything up to and including the /index/th occurrence of
this string will not be considered part of the completion, but the
rest will. <em>index</em> may be negative to count from the end: in most
cases, <em>index</em> will be 1 or -1. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
compctl -s &#39;`users`&#39; -x &#39;n[1,@]&#39; -k hosts -- talk
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
will usually complete usernames, but if you insert an <strong>@</strong> after the
name, names from the array <em>hosts</em> (assumed to contain hostnames,
though you must make the array yourself) will be completed. Other
commands such as <strong>rcp</strong> can be handled similarly.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>N[*/index/</strong>,*/string/*]*…
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>n</strong> except that the string will
be taken as a character class. Anything up to and including the
<em>index/th occurrence of any of the characters in /string</em> will not be
considered part of the completion.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>m[*/min/</strong>,*/max/*]*…
</dt>
<dd>Matches if the total number of words lies
between <em>min</em> and <em>max</em> inclusive.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>r[*/str1/</strong>,*/str2/*]*…
</dt>
<dd>Matches if the cursor is after a word
with prefix <em>str1</em>. If there is also a word with prefix <em>str2</em> on the
command line after the one matched by <em>str1</em> it matches only if the
cursor is before this word. If the comma and <em>str2</em> are omitted, it
matches if the cursor is after a word with prefix <em>str1</em>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>R[*/str1/</strong>,*/str2/*]*…
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>r</strong> but using pattern matching
instead.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>q[*/str/*]</strong>…
</dt>
<dd>Matches the word currently being completed is in
single quotes and the <em>str</em> begins with the letter `s&#39;, or if
completion is done in double quotes and <em>str</em> starts with the letter
`d&#39;, or if completion is done in backticks and <em>str</em> starts with a
`b&#39;.</dd>

EXAMPLE
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-2">
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">

<p>
This is to be interpreted as follows:</p>
<p>
If the current command is <strong>mail</strong>, then</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
if ((the current word begins with + and the previous word is -f)
or (the current word begins with -f+)), then complete the
non-directory part (the `:t&#39; glob modifier) of files in the directory
~/Mail; else

if the current word begins with -f or the previous word was -f, then
complete any file; else

complete user names.
