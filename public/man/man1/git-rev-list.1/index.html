DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>List commits that are reachable by following the <strong>parent</strong> links from the
given commit(s), but exclude commits that are reachable from the one(s)
given with a <em>^</em> in front of them. The output is given in reverse
chronological order by default.</p>
<p>
You can think of this as a set operation. Commits reachable from any of
the commits given on the command line form a set, and then commits
reachable from any of the ones given with <em>^</em> in front are subtracted
from that set. The remaining commits are what comes out in the command&#39;s
output. Various other options and paths parameters can be used to
further limit the result.</p>
<p>
Thus, the following command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git rev-list foo bar ^baz
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
means &#34;list all the commits which are reachable from <em>foo</em> or <em>bar</em>, but
not from <em>baz</em>&#34;.</p>
<p>
A special notation &#34;<em>&lt;commit1&gt;</em>../&lt;commit2&gt;/&#34; can be used as a
short-hand for &#34;^/&lt;commit1&gt;/ <em>&lt;commit2&gt;</em>&#34;. For example, either of the
following may be used interchangeably:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git rev-list origin..HEAD
$ git rev-list HEAD ^origin
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Another special notation is &#34;<em>&lt;commit1&gt;</em>…/&lt;commit2&gt;/&#34; which is useful
for merges. The resulting set of commits is the symmetric difference
between the two operands. The following two commands are equivalent:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git rev-list A B --not $(git merge-base --all A B)
$ git rev-list A...B
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>rev-list</em> is an essential Git command, since it provides the ability to
build and traverse commit ancestry graphs. For this reason, it has a lot
of different options that enable it to be used by commands as different
as <em>git bisect</em> and <em>git repack</em>.</p>

Commit Limiting
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the
special notations explained in the description, additional commit
limiting may be applied.</p>
<p>
Using more options generally further limits the output (e.g.
<strong>–since=&lt;date1&gt;</strong> limits to commits newer than <strong>&lt;date1&gt;</strong>, and using it
with <strong>–grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</strong> further limits to commits whose log message has
a line that matches <strong>&lt;pattern&gt;</strong>), unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>
Note that these are applied before commit ordering and formatting
options, such as <strong>–reverse</strong>.</p>
<p>
-&lt;number&gt;, -n &lt;number&gt;, –max-count=&lt;number&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the number of commits to output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–skip=&lt;number&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Skip <em>number</em> commits before starting to show the commit output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–since=&lt;date&gt;, –after=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show commits more recent than a specific date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–since-as-filter=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show all commits more recent than a specific date. This visits all
commits in the range, rather than stopping at the first commit which is
older than a specific date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–until=&lt;date&gt;, –before=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show commits older than a specific date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–max-age=&lt;timestamp&gt;, –min-age=&lt;timestamp&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the commits output to specified time range.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–author=&lt;pattern&gt;, –committer=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header lines that
match the specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
<strong>–author=&lt;pattern&gt;</strong>, commits whose author matches any of the given
patterns are chosen (similarly for multiple <strong>–committer=&lt;pattern&gt;</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–grep-reflog=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the commits output to ones with reflog entries that match the
specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
<strong>–grep-reflog</strong>, commits whose reflog message matches any of the given
patterns are chosen. It is an error to use this option unless
<strong>–walk-reflogs</strong> is in use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the commits output to ones with a log message that matches the
specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
<strong>–grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</strong>, commits whose message matches any of the given
patterns are chosen (but see <strong>–all-match</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–all-match</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the commits output to ones that match all given <strong>–grep</strong>, instead
of ones that match at least one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–invert-grep</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the commits output to ones with a log message that do not match
the pattern specified with <strong>–grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-i, –regexp-ignore-case</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Match the regular expression limiting patterns without regard to letter
case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–basic-regexp</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the limiting patterns to be basic regular expressions; this is
the default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-E, –extended-regexp</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular expressions
instead of the default basic regular expressions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-F, –fixed-strings</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings (don&#39;t interpret
pattern as a regular expression).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-P, –perl-regexp</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the limiting patterns to be Perl-compatible regular
expressions.</p>
<p>
Support for these types of regular expressions is an optional
compile-time dependency. If Git wasn&#39;t compiled with support for them
providing this option will cause it to die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–remove-empty</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop when a given path disappears from the tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–merges</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print only merge commits. This is exactly the same as <strong>–min-parents=2</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-merges</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not print commits with more than one parent. This is exactly the same
as <strong>–max-parents=1</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–min-parents=&lt;number&gt;, –max-parents=&lt;number&gt;, –no-min-parents,
–no-max-parents</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show only commits which have at least (or at most) that many parent
commits. In particular, <strong>–max-parents=1</strong> is the same as <strong>–no-merges</strong>,
<strong>–min-parents=2</strong> is the same as <strong>–merges</strong>. <strong>–max-parents=0</strong> gives all
root commits and <strong>–min-parents=3</strong> all octopus merges.</p>
<p>
<strong>–no-min-parents</strong> and <strong>–no-max-parents</strong> reset these limits (to no
limit) again. Equivalent forms are <strong>–min-parents=0</strong> (any commit has 0
or more parents) and <strong>–max-parents=-1</strong> (negative numbers denote no
upper limit).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–first-parent</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When finding commits to include, follow only the first parent commit
upon seeing a merge commit. This option can give a better overview when
viewing the evolution of a particular topic branch, because merges into
a topic branch tend to be only about adjusting to updated upstream from
time to time, and this option allows you to ignore the individual
commits brought in to your history by such a merge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–exclude-first-parent-only</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When finding commits to exclude (with a <em>^</em>), follow only the first
parent commit upon seeing a merge commit. This can be used to find the
set of changes in a topic branch from the point where it diverged from
the remote branch, given that arbitrary merges can be valid topic branch
changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–not</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reverses the meaning of the <em>^</em> prefix (or lack thereof) for all
following revision specifiers, up to the next <strong>–not</strong>. When used on the
command line before –stdin, the revisions passed through stdin will not
be affected by it. Conversely, when passed via standard input, the
revisions passed on the command line will not be affected by it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–all</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all the refs in <strong>refs/</strong>, along with <strong>HEAD</strong>, are listed on
the command line as <em>&lt;commit&gt;</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–branches[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all the refs in <strong>refs/heads</strong> are listed on the command
line as <em>&lt;commit&gt;</em>. If <em>&lt;pattern&gt;</em> is given, limit branches to ones
matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks <em>?</em>, <em>*</em>, or <em>[</em>, <em>/*</em> at
the end is implied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–tags[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all the refs in <strong>refs/tags</strong> are listed on the command line
as <em>&lt;commit&gt;</em>. If <em>&lt;pattern&gt;</em> is given, limit tags to ones matching
given shell glob. If pattern lacks <em>?</em>, <em>*</em>, or <em>[</em>, <em>/*</em> at the end is
implied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–remotes[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all the refs in <strong>refs/remotes</strong> are listed on the command
line as <em>&lt;commit&gt;</em>. If <em>&lt;pattern&gt;</em> is given, limit remote-tracking
branches to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks <em>?</em>, <em>*</em>,
or <em>[</em>, <em>/*</em> at the end is implied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–glob=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all the refs matching shell glob <em>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</em> are
listed on the command line as <em>&lt;commit&gt;</em>. Leading <em>refs/</em>, is
automatically prepended if missing. If pattern lacks <em>?</em>, <em>*</em>, or <em>[</em>,
<em>/*</em> at the end is implied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–exclude=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not include refs matching <em>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</em> that the next <strong>–all</strong>,
<strong>–branches</strong>, <strong>–tags</strong>, <strong>–remotes</strong>, or <strong>–glob</strong> would otherwise
consider. Repetitions of this option accumulate exclusion patterns up to
the next <strong>–all</strong>, <strong>–branches</strong>, <strong>–tags</strong>, <strong>–remotes</strong>, or <strong>–glob</strong>
option (other options or arguments do not clear accumulated patterns).</p>
<p>
The patterns given should not begin with <strong>refs/heads</strong>, <strong>refs/tags</strong>, or
<strong>refs/remotes</strong> when applied to <strong>–branches</strong>, <strong>–tags</strong>, or <strong>–remotes</strong>,
respectively, and they must begin with <strong>refs/</strong> when applied to <strong>–glob</strong>
or <strong>–all</strong>. If a trailing <em>/*</em> is intended, it must be given explicitly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–exclude-hidden=[fetch|receive|uploadpack]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not include refs that would be hidden by <strong>git-fetch</strong>,
<strong>git-receive-pack</strong> or <strong>git-upload-pack</strong> by consulting the appropriate
<strong>fetch.hideRefs</strong>, <strong>receive.hideRefs</strong> or <strong>uploadpack.hideRefs</strong>
configuration along with <strong>transfer.hideRefs</strong> (see <strong>git-config*(1)). This
option affects the next pseudo-ref option *–all</strong> or <strong>–glob</strong> and is
cleared after processing them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–reflog</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all objects mentioned by reflogs are listed on the command
line as <strong>&lt;commit&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–alternate-refs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretend as if all objects mentioned as ref tips of alternate
repositories were listed on the command line. An alternate repository is
any repository whose object directory is specified in
<strong>objects/info/alternates</strong>. The set of included objects may be modified
by <strong>core.alternateRefsCommand</strong>, etc. See *git-config*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–single-worktree</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, all working trees will be examined by the following options
when there are more than one (see <strong>git-worktree*(1)): *–all</strong>,
<strong>–reflog</strong> and <strong>–indexed-objects</strong>. This option forces them to examine
the current working tree only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignore-missing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon seeing an invalid object name in the input, pretend as if the bad
input was not given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–stdin</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to getting arguments from the command line, read them from
standard input as well. This accepts commits and pseudo-options like
<strong>–all</strong> and <strong>–glob=</strong>. When a <strong>–</strong> separator is seen, the following
input is treated as paths and used to limit the result. Flags like
<strong>–not</strong> which are read via standard input are only respected for
arguments passed in the same way and will not influence any subsequent
command line arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–quiet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t print anything to standard output. This form is primarily meant to
allow the caller to test the exit status to see if a range of objects is
fully connected (or not). It is faster than redirecting stdout to
<strong>/dev/null</strong> as the output does not have to be formatted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–disk-usage, –disk-usage=human</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppress normal output; instead, print the sum of the bytes used for
on-disk storage by the selected commits or objects. This is equivalent
to piping the output into <strong>git cat-file
–batch-check=%(objectsize:disk)</strong>, except that it runs much faster
(especially with <strong>–use-bitmap-index</strong>). See the <strong>CAVEATS</strong> section in
<strong>git-cat-file*(1) for the limitations of what &#34;on-disk storage&#34; means.
With the optional value *human</strong>, on-disk storage size is shown in
human-readable string(e.g. 12.24 Kib, 3.50 Mib).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–cherry-mark</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like <strong>–cherry-pick</strong> (see below) but mark equivalent commits with <strong>=</strong>
rather than omitting them, and inequivalent ones with <strong>+</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–cherry-pick</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Omit any commit that introduces the same change as another commit on the
“other side” when the set of commits are limited with symmetric
difference.</p>
<p>
For example, if you have two branches, <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, a usual way to list
all commits on only one side of them is with <strong>–left-right</strong> (see the
example below in the description of the <strong>–left-right</strong> option). However,
it shows the commits that were cherry-picked from the other branch (for
example, “3rd on b” may be cherry-picked from branch A). With this
option, such pairs of commits are excluded from the output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–left-only, –right-only</p>
<blockquote>
<p>List only commits on the respective side of a symmetric difference, i.e.
only those which would be marked <strong>&lt;</strong> resp. <strong>&gt;</strong> by <strong>–left-right</strong>.</p>
<p>
For example, <strong>–cherry-pick –right-only A…B</strong> omits those commits from
<strong>B</strong> which are in <strong>A</strong> or are patch-equivalent to a commit in <strong>A</strong>. In
other words, this lists the <strong>+</strong> commits from <strong>git cherry A B</strong>. More
precisely, <strong>–cherry-pick –right-only –no-merges</strong> gives the exact
list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–cherry</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A synonym for <strong>–right-only –cherry-mark –no-merges</strong>; useful to limit
the output to the commits on our side and mark those that have been
applied to the other side of a forked history with <strong>git log –cherry
upstream…mybranch</strong>, similar to <strong>git cherry upstream mybranch</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-g, –walk-reflogs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk reflog entries from
the most recent one to older ones. When this option is used you cannot
specify commits to exclude (that is, <em>^commit</em>, <em>commit1..commit2</em>, and
<em>commit1…commit2</em> notations cannot be used).</p>
<p>
With <strong>–pretty</strong> format other than <strong>oneline</strong> and <strong>reference</strong> (for obvious
reasons), this causes the output to have two extra lines of information
taken from the reflog. The reflog designator in the output may be shown
as <strong>ref@{&lt;Nth&gt;}</strong> (where <em>&lt;Nth&gt;</em> is the reverse-chronological index in
the reflog) or as <strong>ref@{&lt;timestamp&gt;}</strong> (with the <em>&lt;timestamp&gt;</em> for that
entry), depending on a few rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>If the starting point is specified as <strong>ref@{&lt;Nth&gt;}</strong>, show the index
format.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>If the starting point was specified as <strong>ref@{now}</strong>, show the timestamp
format.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>If neither was used, but <strong>–date</strong> was given on the command line, show
the timestamp in the format requested by <strong>–date</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, show the index format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Under <strong>–pretty=oneline</strong>, the commit message is prefixed with this
information on the same line. This option cannot be combined with
<strong>–reverse</strong>. See also *git-reflog*(1).</p>
<p>
Under <strong>–pretty=reference</strong>, this information will not be shown at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–merge</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show commits touching conflicted paths in the range <strong>HEAD…&lt;other&gt;</strong>,
where <strong>&lt;other&gt;</strong> is the first existing pseudoref in <strong>MERGE_HEAD</strong>,
<strong>CHERRY_PICK_HEAD</strong>, <strong>REVERT_HEAD</strong> or <strong>REBASE_HEAD</strong>. Only works when the
index has unmerged entries. This option can be used to show relevant
commits when resolving conflicts from a 3-way merge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–boundary</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output excluded boundary commits. Boundary commits are prefixed with
<strong>-</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–use-bitmap-index</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try to speed up the traversal using the pack bitmap index (if one is
available). Note that when traversing with <strong>–objects</strong>, trees and blobs
will not have their associated path printed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–progress=&lt;header&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show progress reports on stderr as objects are considered. The
<strong>&lt;header&gt;</strong> text will be printed with each progress update.</p>

History Simplification
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history, for example
the commits modifying a particular &lt;path&gt;. But there are two parts of
<em>History Simplification</em>, one part is selecting the commits and the
other is how to do it, as there are various strategies to simplify the
history.</p>
<p>
The following options select the commits to be shown:</p>
<p>
&lt;paths&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commits modifying the given &lt;paths&gt; are selected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–simplify-by-decoration</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commits that are referred by some branch or tag are selected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that extra commits can be shown to give a meaningful history.</p>
<p>
The following options affect the way the simplification is performed:</p>
<p>
Default mode</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simplifies the history to the simplest history explaining the final
state of the tree. Simplest because it prunes some side branches if the
end result is the same (i.e. merging branches with the same content)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–show-pulls</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Include all commits from the default mode, but also any merge commits
that are not TREESAME to the first parent but are TREESAME to a later
parent. This mode is helpful for showing the merge commits that &#34;first
introduced&#34; a change to a branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–full-history</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Same as the default mode, but does not prune some history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–dense</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only the selected commits are shown, plus some to have a meaningful
history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–sparse</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All commits in the simplified history are shown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–simplify-merges</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additional option to <strong>–full-history</strong> to remove some needless merges
from the resulting history, as there are no selected commits
contributing to this merge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ancestry-path[=&lt;commit&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When given a range of commits to display (e.g. <em>commit1..commit2</em> or
<em>commit2 ^commit1</em>), only display commits in that range that are
ancestors of &lt;commit&gt;, descendants of &lt;commit&gt;, or &lt;commit&gt; itself. If
no commit is specified, use <em>commit1</em> (the excluded part of the range)
as &lt;commit&gt;. Can be passed multiple times; if so, a commit is included
if it is any of the commits given or if it is an ancestor or descendant
of one of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A more detailed explanation follows.</p>
<p>
Suppose you specified <strong>foo</strong> as the &lt;paths&gt;. We shall call commits that
modify <strong>foo</strong> !TREESAME, and the rest TREESAME. (In a diff filtered for
<strong>foo</strong>, they look different and equal, respectively.)</p>
<p>
In the following, we will always refer to the same example history to
illustrate the differences between simplification settings. We assume
that you are filtering for a file <strong>foo</strong> in this commit graph:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M---N---O---P---Q
         /     /   /   /   /   /
        I     B   C   D   E   Y
         \   /   /   /   /   /
          `-------------   X
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The horizontal line of history A—Q is taken to be the first parent of
each merge. The commits are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>I</strong> is the initial commit, in which <strong>foo</strong> exists with contents “asdf”,
and a file <strong>quux</strong> exists with contents “quux”. Initial commits are
compared to an empty tree, so <strong>I</strong> is !TREESAME.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
In <strong>A</strong>, <strong>foo</strong> contains just “foo”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>B</strong> contains the same change as <strong>A</strong>. Its merge <strong>M</strong> is trivial and hence
TREESAME to all parents.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>C</strong> does not change <strong>foo</strong>, but its merge <strong>N</strong> changes it to “foobar”, so
it is not TREESAME to any parent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>D</strong> sets <strong>foo</strong> to “baz”. Its merge <strong>O</strong> combines the strings from <strong>N</strong> and
<strong>D</strong> to “foobarbaz”; i.e., it is not TREESAME to any parent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>E</strong> changes <strong>quux</strong> to “xyzzy”, and its merge <strong>P</strong> combines the strings to
“quux xyzzy”. <strong>P</strong> is TREESAME to <strong>O</strong>, but not to <strong>E</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>

<strong>X</strong> is an independent root commit that added a new file <strong>side</strong>, and <strong>Y</strong>

<p>
<strong>rev-list</strong> walks backwards through history, including or excluding
commits based on whether <strong>–full-history</strong> and/or parent rewriting (via
<strong>–parents</strong> or <strong>–children</strong>) are used. The following settings are
available.</p>
<p>
Default mode</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent (though this
can be changed, see <strong>–sparse</strong> below). If the commit was a merge, and it
was TREESAME to one parent, follow only that parent. (Even if there are
several TREESAME parents, follow only one of them.) Otherwise, follow
all parents.</p>
<p>
This results in:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---N---O
         /     /   /
        I---------D
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is
available, removed <strong>B</strong> from consideration entirely. <strong>C</strong> was considered
via <strong>N</strong>, but is TREESAME. Root commits are compared to an empty tree, so
<strong>I</strong> is !TREESAME.</p>
<p>
Parent/child relations are only visible with <strong>–parents</strong>, but that does
not affect the commits selected in default mode, so we have shown the
parent lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–full-history without parent rewriting</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This mode differs from the default in one point: always follow all
parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them. Even if more
than one side of the merge has commits that are included, this does not
imply that the merge itself is! In the example, we get</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        I  A  B  N  D  O  P  Q
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>M</strong> was excluded because it is TREESAME to both parents. <strong>E</strong>, <strong>C</strong> and
<strong>B</strong> were all walked, but only <strong>B</strong> was !TREESAME, so the others do not
appear.</p>
<p>
Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to talk
about the parent/child relationships between the commits, so we show
them disconnected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–full-history with parent rewriting</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ordinary commits are only included if they are !TREESAME (though this
can be changed, see <strong>–sparse</strong> below).</p>
<p>
Merges are always included. However, their parent list is rewritten:
Along each parent, prune away commits that are not included themselves.
This results in</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M---N---O---P---Q
         /     /   /   /   /
        I     B   /   D   /
         \   /   /   /   /
          `-------------
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Compare to <strong>–full-history</strong> without rewriting above. Note that <strong>E</strong> was
pruned away because it is TREESAME, but the parent list of P was
rewritten to contain <strong>E*s parent *I</strong>. The same happened for <strong>C</strong> and <strong>N</strong>,
and <strong>X</strong>, <strong>Y</strong> and <strong>Q</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In addition to the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME
affects inclusion:</p>
<p>
–dense</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commits that are walked are included if they are not TREESAME to any
parent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–sparse</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All commits that are walked are included.</p>
<p>
Note that without <strong>–full-history</strong>, this still simplifies merges: if one
of the parents is TREESAME, we follow only that one, so the other sides
of the merge are never walked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–simplify-merges</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, build a history graph in the same way that <strong>–full-history</strong> with
parent rewriting does (see above).</p>
<p>
Then simplify each commit <strong>C</strong> to its replacement <strong>C</strong> in the final
history according to the following rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Set <strong>C</strong> to <strong>C</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Replace each parent <strong>P</strong> of <strong>C</strong> with its simplification <strong>P</strong>. In the
process, drop parents that are ancestors of other parents or that are
root commits TREESAME to an empty tree, and remove duplicates, but take
care to never drop all parents that we are TREESAME to.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
If after this parent rewriting, <strong>C</strong> is a root or merge commit (has zero
or &gt;1 parents), a boundary commit, or !TREESAME, it remains. Otherwise,
it is replaced with its only parent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The effect of this is best shown by way of comparing to <strong>–full-history</strong>
with parent rewriting. The example turns into:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M---N---O
         /     /       /
        I     B       D
         \   /       /
          `---------
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note the major differences in <strong>N</strong>, <strong>P</strong>, and <strong>Q</strong> over <strong>–full-history</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>N*s parent list had *I</strong> removed, because it is an ancestor of the other
parent <strong>M</strong>. Still, <strong>N</strong> remained because it is !TREESAME.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>P*s parent list similarly had *I</strong> removed. <strong>P</strong> was then removed
completely, because it had one parent and is TREESAME.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<strong>Q*s parent list had *Y</strong> simplified to <strong>X</strong>. <strong>X</strong> was then removed,
because it was a TREESAME root. <strong>Q</strong> was then removed completely, because
it had one parent and is TREESAME.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is another simplification mode available:</p>
<p>
–ancestry-path[=&lt;commit&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limit the displayed commits to those which are an ancestor of &lt;commit&gt;,
or which are a descendant of &lt;commit&gt;, or are &lt;commit&gt; itself.</p>
<p>
As an example use case, consider the following commit history:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
            D---E-------F
           /     \       \
          B---C---G---H---I---J
         /                     \
        A-------K---------------L--M
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
A regular <em>D..M</em> computes the set of commits that are ancestors of <strong>M</strong>,
but excludes the ones that are ancestors of <strong>D</strong>. This is useful to see
what happened to the history leading to <strong>M</strong> since <strong>D</strong>, in the sense that
“what does <strong>M</strong> have that did not exist in <strong>D*”. The result in this
example would be all the commits, except *A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> (and <strong>D</strong> itself, of
course).</p>
<p>
When we want to find out what commits in <strong>M</strong> are contaminated with the
bug introduced by <strong>D</strong> and need fixing, however, we might want to view
only the subset of <em>D..M</em> that are actually descendants of <strong>D</strong>, i.e.
excluding <strong>C</strong> and <strong>K</strong>. This is exactly what the <strong>–ancestry-path</strong> option
does. Applied to the <em>D..M</em> range, it results in:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
                E-------F
                 \       \
                  G---H---I---J
                               \
                                L--M
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
We can also use <strong>–ancestry-path=D</strong> instead of <strong>–ancestry-path</strong> which
means the same thing when applied to the <em>D..M</em> range but is just more
explicit.</p>
<p>
If we instead are interested in a given topic within this range, and all
commits affected by that topic, we may only want to view the subset of
<strong>D..M</strong> which contain that topic in their ancestry path. So, using
<strong>–ancestry-path=H D..M</strong> for example would result in:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
                E
                 \
                  G---H---I---J
                               \
                                L--M
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Whereas <strong>–ancestry-path=K D..M</strong> would result in</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
                K---------------L--M
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
Before discussing another option, <strong>–show-pulls</strong>, we need to create a
new example history.</p>
<p>
A common problem users face when looking at simplified history is that a
commit they know changed a file somehow does not appear in the file&#39;s
simplified history. Let&#39;s demonstrate a new example and show how options
such as <strong>–full-history</strong> and <strong>–simplify-merges</strong> works in that case:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M-----C--N---O---P
         /     / \  \  \/   /   /
        I     B   \  R-`-Z   /
         \   /     \/         /
          \ /      /\        /
           `---X--  `---Y--
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
For this example, suppose <strong>I</strong> created <strong>file.txt</strong> which was modified by
<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>X</strong> in different ways. The single-parent commits <strong>C</strong>, <strong>Z</strong>,
and <strong>Y</strong> do not change <strong>file.txt</strong>. The merge commit <strong>M</strong> was created by
resolving the merge conflict to include both changes from <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>
and hence is not TREESAME to either. The merge commit <strong>R</strong>, however, was
created by ignoring the contents of <strong>file.txt</strong> at <strong>M</strong> and taking only
the contents of <strong>file.txt</strong> at <strong>X</strong>. Hence, <strong>R</strong> is TREESAME to <strong>X</strong> but not
<strong>M</strong>. Finally, the natural merge resolution to create <strong>N</strong> is to take the
contents of <strong>file.txt</strong> at <strong>R</strong>, so <strong>N</strong> is TREESAME to <strong>R</strong> but not <strong>C</strong>.
The merge commits <strong>O</strong> and <strong>P</strong> are TREESAME to their first parents, but
not to their second parents, <strong>Z</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> respectively.</p>
<p>
When using the default mode, <strong>N</strong> and <strong>R</strong> both have a TREESAME parent, so
those edges are walked and the others are ignored. The resulting history
graph is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        I---X
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
When using <strong>–full-history</strong>, Git walks every edge. This will discover
the commits <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> and the merge <strong>M</strong>, but also will reveal the
merge commits <strong>O</strong> and <strong>P</strong>. With parent rewriting, the resulting graph
is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M--------N---O---P
         /     / \  \  \/   /   /
        I     B   \  R-`--   /
         \   /     \/         /
          \ /      /\        /
           `---X--  `------
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here, the merge commits <strong>O</strong> and <strong>P</strong> contribute extra noise, as they did
not actually contribute a change to <strong>file.txt</strong>. They only merged a topic
that was based on an older version of <strong>file.txt</strong>. This is a common issue
in repositories using a workflow where many contributors work in
parallel and merge their topic branches along a single trunk: many
unrelated merges appear in the <strong>–full-history</strong> results.</p>
<p>
When using the <strong>–simplify-merges</strong> option, the commits <strong>O</strong> and <strong>P</strong>
disappear from the results. This is because the rewritten second parents
of <strong>O</strong> and <strong>P</strong> are reachable from their first parents. Those edges are
removed and then the commits look like single-parent commits that are
TREESAME to their parent. This also happens to the commit <strong>N</strong>, resulting
in a history view as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M--.
         /     /    \
        I     B      R
         \   /      /
          \ /      /
           `---X--
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In this view, we see all of the important single-parent changes from
<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>X</strong>. We also see the carefully-resolved merge <strong>M</strong> and the
not-so-carefully-resolved merge <strong>R</strong>. This is usually enough information
to determine why the commits <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> &#34;disappeared&#34; from history in
the default view. However, there are a few issues with this approach.</p>
<p>
The first issue is performance. Unlike any previous option, the
<strong>–simplify-merges</strong> option requires walking the entire commit history
before returning a single result. This can make the option difficult to
use for very large repositories.</p>
<p>
The second issue is one of auditing. When many contributors are working
on the same repository, it is important which merge commits introduced a
change into an important branch. The problematic merge <strong>R</strong> above is not
likely to be the merge commit that was used to merge into an important
branch. Instead, the merge <strong>N</strong> was used to merge <strong>R</strong> and <strong>X</strong> into the
important branch. This commit may have information about why the change
<strong>X</strong> came to override the changes from <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> in its commit message.</p>
<p>
–show-pulls</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the commits shown in the default history, show each merge
commit that is not TREESAME to its first parent but is TREESAME to a
later parent.</p>
<p>
When a merge commit is included by <strong>–show-pulls</strong>, the merge is treated
as if it &#34;pulled&#34; the change from another branch. When using
<strong>–show-pulls</strong> on this example (and no other options) the resulting
graph is:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        I---X---R---N
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here, the merge commits <strong>R</strong> and <strong>N</strong> are included because they pulled the
commits <strong>X</strong> and <strong>R</strong> into the base branch, respectively. These merges are
the reason the commits <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> do not appear in the default history.</p>
<p>
When <strong>–show-pulls</strong> is paired with <strong>–simplify-merges</strong>, the graph
includes all of the necessary information:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
          .-A---M--.   N
         /     /    \ /
        I     B      R
         \   /      /
          \ /      /
           `---X--
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Notice that since <strong>M</strong> is reachable from <strong>R</strong>, the edge from <strong>N</strong> to <strong>M</strong>
was simplified away. However, <strong>N</strong> still appears in the history as an
important commit because it &#34;pulled&#34; the change <strong>R</strong> into the main
branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <strong>–simplify-by-decoration</strong> option allows you to view only the big
picture of the topology of the history, by omitting commits that are not
referenced by tags. Commits are marked as !TREESAME (in other words,
kept after history simplification rules described above) if (1) they are
referenced by tags, or (2) they change the contents of the paths given
on the command line. All other commits are marked as TREESAME (subject
to be simplified away).</p>

Bisection Helpers

<p>Limit output to the one commit object which is roughly halfway between
included and excluded commits. Note that the bad bisection ref
<strong>refs/bisect/bad</strong> is added to the included commits (if it exists) and
the good bisection refs <strong>refs/bisect/good-*</strong> are added to the excluded
commits (if they exist). Thus, supposing there are no refs in
<strong>refs/bisect/</strong>, if</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">

outputs <em>midpoint</em>, the output of the two commands</p>

<p>
would be of roughly the same length. Finding the change which introduces
a regression is thus reduced to a binary search: repeatedly generate and
test new midpoint&#39;s until the commit chain is of length one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–bisect-vars</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This calculates the same as <strong>–bisect</strong>, except that refs in
<strong>refs/bisect/</strong> are not used, and except that this outputs text ready to
be eval&#39;ed by the shell. These lines will assign the name of the
midpoint revision to the variable <strong>bisect_rev</strong>, and the expected number
of commits to be tested after <strong>bisect_rev</strong> is tested to <strong>bisect_nr</strong>, the
expected number of commits to be tested if <strong>bisect_rev</strong> turns out to be
good to <strong>bisect_good</strong>, the expected number of commits to be tested if
<strong>bisect_rev</strong> turns out to be bad to <strong>bisect_bad</strong>, and the number of
commits we are bisecting right now to <strong>bisect_all</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–bisect-all</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This outputs all the commit objects between the included and excluded
commits, ordered by their distance to the included and excluded commits.
Refs in <strong>refs/bisect/</strong> are not used. The farthest from them is displayed
first. (This is the only one displayed by <strong>–bisect</strong>.)</p>
<p>
This is useful because it makes it easy to choose a good commit to test
when you want to avoid to test some of them for some reason (they may
not compile for example).</p>
<p>
This option can be used along with <strong>–bisect-vars</strong>, in this case, after
all the sorted commit objects, there will be the same text as if
<strong>–bisect-vars</strong> had been used alone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Only useful with one of the <strong>–objects*</strong>; omits objects (usually blobs)
from the list of printed objects. The <em>&lt;filter-spec&gt;</em> may be one of the
following:</p>
<p>
The form <em>–filter=blob:none</em> omits all blobs.</p>
<p>
The form <em>–filter=blob:limit=&lt;n&gt;[kmg]</em> omits blobs of size at least n
bytes or units. n may be zero. The suffixes k, m, and g can be used to
name units in KiB, MiB, or GiB. For example, <em>blob:limit=1k</em> is the same
as <em>blob:limit=1024</em>.</p>
<p>
The form <em>–filter=object:type=(tag|commit|tree|blob)</em> omits all objects
which are not of the requested type.</p>
<p>
The form <em>–filter=sparse:oid=&lt;blob-ish&gt;</em> uses a sparse-checkout
specification contained in the blob (or blob-expression) <em>&lt;blob-ish&gt;</em> to
omit blobs that would not be required for a sparse checkout on the
requested refs.</p>
<p>
The form <em>–filter=tree:&lt;depth&gt;</em> omits all blobs and trees whose depth
from the root tree is &gt;= &lt;depth&gt; (minimum depth if an object is located
at multiple depths in the commits traversed). &lt;depth&gt;=0 will not include
any trees or blobs unless included explicitly in the command-line (or
standard input when –stdin is used). &lt;depth&gt;=1 will include only the
tree and blobs which are referenced directly by a commit reachable from
&lt;commit&gt; or an explicitly-given object. &lt;depth&gt;=2 is like &lt;depth&gt;=1
while also including trees and blobs one more level removed from an
explicitly-given commit or tree.</p>
<p>
Note that the form <em>–filter=sparse:path=&lt;path&gt;</em> that wants to read from
an arbitrary path on the filesystem has been dropped for security
reasons.</p>
<p>
Multiple <em>–filter=</em> flags can be specified to combine filters. Only
objects which are accepted by every filter are included.</p>
<p>
The form <em>–filter=combine:&lt;filter1&gt;+&lt;filter2&gt;+…&lt;filterN&gt;</em> can also be
used to combined several filters, but this is harder than just repeating
the <em>–filter</em> flag and is usually not necessary. Filters are joined by
<em>+</em> and individual filters are %-encoded (i.e. URL-encoded). Besides the
<em>+</em> and <em>%</em> characters, the following characters are reserved and also
must be encoded: <strong>~!@#$^&amp;*()[]{}\;&#34;,&lt;&gt;?`</strong> as well as all characters with
ASCII code &lt;= <strong>0x20</strong>, which includes space and newline.</p>
<p>
Other arbitrary characters can also be encoded. For instance,

<p>Only useful with <strong>–filter=</strong>; prints a list of the objects omitted by
the filter. Object IDs are prefixed with a “~” character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–missing=&lt;missing-action&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A debug option to help with future &#34;partial clone&#34; development. This
option specifies how missing objects are handled.</p>
<p>
The form <em>–missing=error</em> requests that rev-list stop with an error if
a missing object is encountered. This is the default action.</p>
<p>
The form <em>–missing=allow-any</em> will allow object traversal to continue
if a missing object is encountered. Missing objects will silently be
omitted from the results.</p>
<p>
The form <em>–missing=allow-promisor</em> is like <em>allow-any</em>, but will only
allow object traversal to continue for EXPECTED promisor missing
objects. Unexpected missing objects will raise an error.</p>
<p>
The form <em>–missing=print</em> is like <em>allow-any</em>, but will also print a
list of the missing objects. Object IDs are prefixed with a “?”
character.</p>
<p>
If some tips passed to the traversal are missing, they will be
considered as missing too, and the traversal will ignore them. In case
we cannot get their Object ID though, an error will be raised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–exclude-promisor-objects</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(For internal use only.) Prefilter object traversal at promisor
boundary. This is used with partial clone. This is stronger than
<strong>–missing=allow-promisor</strong> because it limits the traversal, rather than
just silencing errors about missing objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-walk[=(sorted|unsorted)]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only show the given commits, but do not traverse their ancestors. This
has no effect if a range is specified. If the argument <strong>unsorted</strong> is
given, the commits are shown in the order they were given on the command
line. Otherwise (if <strong>sorted</strong> or no argument was given), the commits are
shown in reverse chronological order by commit time. Cannot be combined
with <strong>–graph</strong>.</p>

<p>
–pretty[=&lt;format&gt;], –format=&lt;format&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretty-print the contents of the commit logs in a given format, where
<em>&lt;format&gt;</em> can be one of <em>oneline</em>, <em>short</em>, <em>medium</em>, <em>full</em>, <em>fuller</em>,

See the &#34;PRETTY FORMATS&#34; section for some additional details for each
format. When <em>=&lt;format&gt;</em> part is omitted, it defaults to <em>medium</em>.</p>
<p>
Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the repository
configuration (see *git-config*(1)).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–abbrev-commit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name, show
a prefix that names the object uniquely. &#34;–abbrev=&lt;n&gt;&#34; (which also
modifies diff output, if it is displayed) option can be used to specify
the minimum length of the prefix.</p>
<p>
This should make &#34;–pretty=oneline&#34; a whole lot more readable for people
using 80-column terminals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-abbrev-commit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name. This negates
<strong>–abbrev-commit</strong>, either explicit or implied by other options such as
&#34;–oneline&#34;. It also overrides the <strong>log.abbrevCommit</strong> variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–oneline</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a shorthand for &#34;–pretty=oneline –abbrev-commit&#34; used
together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–encoding=&lt;encoding&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commit objects record the character encoding used for the log message in
their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the command to
re-code the commit log message in the encoding preferred by the user.
For non plumbing commands this defaults to UTF-8. Note that if an object
claims to be encoded in <strong>X</strong> and we are outputting in <strong>X</strong>, we will output
the object verbatim; this means that invalid sequences in the original
commit may be copied to the output. Likewise, if iconv(3) fails to
convert the commit, we will quietly output the original object verbatim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–expand-tabs=&lt;n&gt;, –expand-tabs, –no-expand-tabs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perform a tab expansion (replace each tab with enough spaces to fill to
the next display column that is a multiple of <em>&lt;n&gt;</em>) in the log message
before showing it in the output. <strong>–expand-tabs</strong> is a short-hand for
<strong>–expand-tabs=8</strong>, and <strong>–no-expand-tabs</strong> is a short-hand for
<strong>–expand-tabs=0</strong>, which disables tab expansion.</p>
<p>
By default, tabs are expanded in pretty formats that indent the log
message by 4 spaces (i.e. <em>medium</em>, which is the default, <em>full</em>, and
<em>fuller</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–show-signature</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Check the validity of a signed commit object by passing the signature to
<strong>gpg –verify</strong> and show the output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–relative-date</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synonym for <strong>–date=relative</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–date=&lt;format&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only takes effect for dates shown in human-readable format, such as when
using <strong>–pretty</strong>. <strong>log.date</strong> config variable sets a default value for
the log command&#39;s <strong>–date</strong> option. By default, dates are shown in the
original time zone (either committer&#39;s or author&#39;s). If <strong>-local</strong> is
appended to the format (e.g., <strong>iso-local</strong>), the user&#39;s local time zone
is used instead.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=relative</strong> shows dates relative to the current time, e.g. “2
hours ago”. The <strong>-local</strong> option has no effect for <strong>–date=relative</strong>.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=local</strong> is an alias for <strong>–date=default-local</strong>.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=iso</strong> (or <strong>–date=iso8601</strong>) shows timestamps in a ISO 8601-like
format. The differences to the strict ISO 8601 format are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
a space instead of the <strong>T</strong> date/time delimiter</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
a space between time and time zone</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
no colon between hours and minutes of the time zone</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–date=iso-strict</strong> (or <strong>–date=iso8601-strict</strong>) shows timestamps in
strict ISO 8601 format.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=rfc</strong> (or <strong>–date=rfc2822</strong>) shows timestamps in RFC 2822 format,
often found in email messages.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=short</strong> shows only the date, but not the time, in <strong>YYYY-MM-DD</strong>
format.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=raw</strong> shows the date as seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01
00:00:00 UTC), followed by a space, and then the timezone as an offset
from UTC (a <strong>+</strong> or <strong>-</strong> with four digits; the first two are hours, and
the second two are minutes). I.e., as if the timestamp were formatted
with <strong>strftime(&#34;%s %z&#34;)</strong>). Note that the <strong>-local</strong> option does not affect
the seconds-since-epoch value (which is always measured in UTC), but
does switch the accompanying timezone value.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=human</strong> shows the timezone if the timezone does not match the
current time-zone, and doesn&#39;t print the whole date if that matches (ie
skip printing year for dates that are &#34;this year&#34;, but also skip the
whole date itself if it&#39;s in the last few days and we can just say what
weekday it was). For older dates the hour and minute is also omitted.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=unix</strong> shows the date as a Unix epoch timestamp (seconds since
1970). As with <strong>–raw</strong>, this is always in UTC and therefore <strong>-local</strong> has
no effect.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=format:…</strong> feeds the format <strong>…</strong> to your system <strong>strftime</strong>,
except for %s, %z, and %Z, which are handled internally. Use
<strong>–date=format:%c</strong> to show the date in your system locale&#39;s preferred
format. See the <strong>strftime</strong> manual for a complete list of format
placeholders. When using <strong>-local</strong>, the correct syntax is
<strong>–date=format-local:…</strong>.</p>
<p>
<strong>–date=default</strong> is the default format, and is based on ctime(3) output.
It shows a single line with three-letter day of the week, three-letter
month, day-of-month, hour-minute-seconds in &#34;HH:MM:SS&#34; format, followed
by 4-digit year, plus timezone information, unless the local time zone
is used, e.g. <strong>Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 1970 +0000</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–header</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print the contents of the commit in raw-format; each record is separated
with a NUL character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-commit-header</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppress the header line containing &#34;commit&#34; and the object ID printed
before the specified format. This has no effect on the built-in formats;
only custom formats are affected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–commit-header</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overrides a previous <strong>–no-commit-header</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–parents</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print also the parents of the commit (in the form &#34;commit parent…&#34;).
Also enables parent rewriting, see <em>History Simplification</em> above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–children</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print also the children of the commit (in the form &#34;commit child…&#34;).
Also enables parent rewriting, see <em>History Simplification</em> above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–timestamp</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print the raw commit timestamp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–left-right</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mark which side of a symmetric difference a commit is reachable from.
Commits from the left side are prefixed with <strong>&lt;</strong> and those from the
right with <strong>&gt;</strong>. If combined with <strong>–boundary</strong>, those commits are
prefixed with <strong>-</strong>.</p>
<p>
For example, if you have this topology:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
             y---b---b  branch B
            / \ /
           /   .
          /   / \
         o---x---a---a  branch A
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
you would get an output like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        $ git rev-list --left-right --boundary --pretty=oneline A...B

        &gt;bbbbbbb... 3rd on b
        &gt;bbbbbbb... 2nd on b
        &lt;aaaaaaa... 3rd on a
        &lt;aaaaaaa... 2nd on a
        -yyyyyyy... 1st on b
        -xxxxxxx... 1st on a
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
–graph</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Draw a text-based graphical representation of the commit history on the
left hand side of the output. This may cause extra lines to be printed
in between commits, in order for the graph history to be drawn properly.
Cannot be combined with <strong>–no-walk</strong>.</p>
<p>
This enables parent rewriting, see <em>History Simplification</em> above.</p>
<p>
This implies the <strong>–topo-order</strong> option by default, but the
<strong>–date-order</strong> option may also be specified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–show-linear-break[=&lt;barrier&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When –graph is not used, all history branches are flattened which can
make it hard to see that the two consecutive commits do not belong to a
linear branch. This option puts a barrier in between them in that case.
If <strong>&lt;barrier&gt;</strong> is specified, it is the string that will be shown instead
of the default one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–count</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a number stating how many commits would have been listed, and
suppress all other output. When used together with <strong>–left-right</strong>,
instead print the counts for left and right commits, separated by a tab.
When used together with <strong>–cherry-mark</strong>, omit patch equivalent commits
from these counts and print the count for equivalent commits separated
by a tab.</p>

<p>If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty-format is not <em>oneline</em>,
<em>email</em> or <em>raw</em>, an additional line is inserted before the <em>Author:</em>
line. This line begins with &#34;Merge: &#34; and the hashes of ancestral
commits are printed, separated by spaces. Note that the listed commits
may not necessarily be the list of the <strong>direct</strong> parent commits if you
have limited your view of history: for example, if you are only
interested in changes related to a certain directory or file.</p>
<p>
There are several built-in formats, and you can define additional
formats by setting a pretty.&lt;name&gt; config option to either another
format name, or a <em>format:</em> string, as described below (see
*git-config*(1)). Here are the details of the built-in formats:</p>

This format is used to refer to another commit in a commit message and

its output is not affected by other options like <strong>–decorate</strong> and
<strong>–walk-reflogs</strong>.</p>

<em>raw</em></p>
<p>
The <em>raw</em> format shows the entire commit exactly as stored in the commit
object. Notably, the hashes are displayed in full, regardless of whether
–abbrev or –no-abbrev are used, and <em>parents</em> information show the
true parent commits, without taking grafts or history simplification
into account. Note that this format affects the way commits are
displayed, but not the way the diff is shown e.g. with <strong>git log –raw</strong>.
To get full object names in a raw diff format, use <strong>–no-abbrev</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>format:&lt;format-string&gt;</em></p>
<p>
The <em>format:&lt;format-string&gt;</em> format allows you to specify which
information you want to show. It works a little bit like printf format,
with the notable exception that you get a newline with <em>%n</em> instead of
<em>\n</em>.</p>
<p>
E.g, <em>format:&#34;The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was &gt;&gt;%s&lt;&lt;%n&#34;</em>
would show something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">

<em>%(trailers[:&lt;options&gt;])</em></p>

provided multiple times, the last occurrence wins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>key=&lt;key&gt;</em>: only show trailers with specified &lt;key&gt;. Matching is done
case-insensitively and trailing colon is optional. If option is given
multiple times trailer lines matching any of the keys are shown. This
option automatically enables the <strong>only</strong> option so that non-trailer lines
in the trailer block are hidden. If that is not desired it can be
disabled with <strong>only=false</strong>. E.g., <strong>%(trailers:key=Reviewed-by)</strong> shows
trailer lines with key <strong>Reviewed-by</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>only[=&lt;bool&gt;]</em>: select whether non-trailer lines from the trailer block
should be included.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>separator=&lt;sep&gt;</em>: specify the separator inserted between trailer lines.
Defaults to a line feed character. The string &lt;sep&gt; may contain the
literal formatting codes described above. To use comma as separator one
must use <strong>%x2C</strong> as it would otherwise be parsed as next option. E.g.,
<strong>%(trailers:key=Ticket,separator=%x2C )</strong> shows all trailer lines whose
key is &#34;Ticket&#34; separated by a comma and a space.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>unfold[=&lt;bool&gt;]</em>: make it behave as if interpret-trailer&#39;s <strong>–unfold</strong>
option was given. E.g., <strong>%(trailers:only,unfold=true)</strong> unfolds and shows
all trailer lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>keyonly[=&lt;bool&gt;]</em>: only show the key part of the trailer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>valueonly[=&lt;bool&gt;]</em>: only show the value part of the trailer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>key_value_separator=&lt;sep&gt;</em>: specify the separator inserted between the
key and value of each trailer. Defaults to &#34;: &#34;. Otherwise it shares the
same semantics as <em>separator=&lt;sep&gt;</em> above.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>\\</p>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>
\\</p>
<p>
Some placeholders may depend on other options given to the revision
traversal engine. For example, the <strong>%g*</strong> reflog options will insert an
empty string unless we are traversing reflog entries (e.g., by <strong>git log
-g</strong>). The <strong>%d</strong> and <strong>%D</strong> placeholders will use the &#34;short&#34; decoration
format if <strong>–decorate</strong> was not already provided on the command line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The boolean options accept an optional value <strong>[=&lt;bool-value&gt;]</strong>. The
values <strong>true</strong>, <strong>false</strong>, <strong>on</strong>, <strong>off</strong> etc. are all accepted. See the
&#34;boolean&#34; sub-section in &#34;EXAMPLES&#34; in *git-config*(1). If a boolean
option is given with no value, it&#39;s enabled.</p>
<p>
If you add a <strong>+</strong> (plus sign) after <em>%</em> of a placeholder, a line-feed is
inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the placeholder
expands to a non-empty string.</p>
<p>
If you add a <strong>-</strong> (minus sign) after <em>%</em> of a placeholder, all
consecutive line-feeds immediately preceding the expansion are deleted
if and only if the placeholder expands to an empty string.</p>
<p>
If you add a ` ` (space) after <em>%</em> of a placeholder, a space is inserted
immediately before the expansion if and only if the placeholder expands
to a non-empty string.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>tformat:</em></p>
<p>
The <em>tformat:</em> format works exactly like <em>format:</em>, except that it
provides &#34;terminator&#34; semantics instead of &#34;separator&#34; semantics. In
other words, each commit has the message terminator character (usually a
newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between entries. This
means that the final entry of a single-line format will be properly
terminated with a new line, just as the &#34;oneline&#34; format does. For
example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git log -2 --pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \
  | perl -pe $_ .= &#34; -- NO NEWLINE\n&#34; unless /\n/
4da45be
7134973 -- NO NEWLINE

$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef \
  | perl -pe $_ .= &#34; -- NO NEWLINE\n&#34; unless /\n/
4da45be
7134973
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In addition, any unrecognized string that has a <strong>%</strong> in it is interpreted
as if it has <strong>tformat:</strong> in front of it. For example, these two are
equivalent:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef
$ git log -2 --pretty=%h 4da45bef
</pre>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Compare the disk size of all reachable objects, versus those reachable
from reflogs, versus the total packed size. This can tell you whether
running <strong>git repack -ad</strong> might reduce the repository size (by dropping
unreachable objects), and whether expiring reflogs might help.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# reachable objects
git rev-list --disk-usage --objects --all
# plus reflogs
git rev-list --disk-usage --objects --all --reflog
# total disk size used
du -c .git/objects/pack/*.pack .git/objects/??/*
# alternative to du: add up &#34;size&#34; and &#34;size-pack&#34; fields
git count-objects -v
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Report the disk size of each branch, not including objects used by the
current branch. This can find outliers that are contributing to a
bloated repository size (e.g., because somebody accidentally committed
large build artifacts).</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
git for-each-ref --format=%(refname) |
while read branch
do
        size=$(git rev-list --disk-usage --objects HEAD..$branch)

<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Compare the on-disk size of branches in one group of refs, excluding
another. If you co-mingle objects from multiple remotes in a single
