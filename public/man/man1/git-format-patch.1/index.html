DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Prepare each non-merge commit with its &#34;patch&#34; in one &#34;message&#34; per
commit, formatted to resemble a UNIX mailbox. The output of this command
is convenient for e-mail submission or for use with <em>git am</em>.</p>
<p>
A &#34;message&#34; generated by the command consists of three parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
A brief metadata header that begins with <strong>From &lt;commit&gt;</strong> with a fixed
<strong>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001</strong> datestamp to help programs like &#34;file(1)&#34; to
recognize that the file is an output from this command, fields that
record the author identity, the author date, and the title of the change
(taken from the first paragraph of the commit log message).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
The second and subsequent paragraphs of the commit log message.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
The &#34;patch&#34;, which is the &#34;diff -p –stat&#34; output (see *git-diff*(1))
between the commit and its parent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The log message and the patch are separated by a line with a three-dash
line.</p>
<p>
There are two ways to specify which commits to operate on.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>A single commit, &lt;since&gt;, specifies that the commits leading to the tip
of the current branch that are not in the history that leads to the
&lt;since&gt; to be output.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Generic &lt;revision-range&gt; expression (see &#34;SPECIFYING REVISIONS&#34; section
in *gitrevisions*(7)) means the commits in the specified range.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The first rule takes precedence in the case of a single &lt;commit&gt;. To
apply the second rule, i.e., format everything since the beginning of
history up until &lt;commit&gt;, use the <strong>–root</strong> option: <strong>git format-patch
–root &lt;commit&gt;</strong>. If you want to format only &lt;commit&gt; itself, you can do
this with <strong>git format-patch -1 &lt;commit&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>
By default, each output file is numbered sequentially from 1, and uses
the first line of the commit message (massaged for pathname safety) as
the filename. With the <strong>–numbered-files</strong> option, the output file names
will only be numbers, without the first line of the commit appended. The
names of the output files are printed to standard output, unless the
<strong>–stdout</strong> option is specified.</p>
<p>
If <strong>-o</strong> is specified, output files are created in &lt;dir&gt;. Otherwise they
are created in the current working directory. The default path can be
set with the <strong>format.outputDirectory</strong> configuration option. The <strong>-o</strong>
option takes precedence over <strong>format.outputDirectory</strong>. To store patches
in the current working directory even when <strong>format.outputDirectory</strong>
points elsewhere, use <strong>-o .</strong>. All directory components will be created.</p>
<p>
By default, the subject of a single patch is &#34;[PATCH] &#34; followed by the
concatenation of lines from the commit message up to the first blank
line (see the DISCUSSION section of *git-commit*(1)).</p>
<p>
When multiple patches are output, the subject prefix will instead be
&#34;[PATCH n/m] &#34;. To force 1/1 to be added for a single patch, use <strong>-n</strong>.
To omit patch numbers from the subject, use <strong>-N</strong>.</p>
<p>
If given <strong>–thread</strong>, <strong>git-format-patch</strong> will generate <strong>In-Reply-To</strong> and
<strong>References</strong> headers to make the second and subsequent patch mails
appear as replies to the first mail; this also generates a <strong>Message-ID</strong>
header to reference.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>-p, –no-stat</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generate plain patches without any diffstats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-U&lt;n&gt;, –unified=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generate diffs with &lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of the usual three.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–output=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output to a specific file instead of stdout.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–output-indicator-new=&lt;char&gt;, –output-indicator-old=&lt;char&gt;,
–output-indicator-context=&lt;char&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify the character used to indicate new, old or context lines in the
generated patch. Normally they are <em>+</em>, <em>-</em> and respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–indent-heuristic</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable the heuristic that shifts diff hunk boundaries to make patches
easier to read. This is the default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-indent-heuristic</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disable the indent heuristic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–minimal</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is produced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–patience</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generate a diff using the &#34;patience diff&#34; algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–histogram</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generate a diff using the &#34;histogram diff&#34; algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–anchored=&lt;text&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generate a diff using the &#34;anchored diff&#34; algorithm.</p>
<p>
This option may be specified more than once.</p>
<p>
If a line exists in both the source and destination, exists only once,
and starts with this text, this algorithm attempts to prevent it from
appearing as a deletion or addition in the output. It uses the &#34;patience
diff&#34; algorithm internally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–diff-algorithm={patience|minimal|histogram|myers}</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Choose a diff algorithm. The variants are as follows:</p>
<p>
<strong>default</strong>, <strong>myers</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>minimal</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is produced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>patience</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use &#34;patience diff&#34; algorithm when generating patches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>histogram</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to &#34;support low-occurrence
common elements&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For instance, if you configured the <strong>diff.algorithm</strong> variable to a
non-default value and want to use the default one, then you have to use
<strong>–diff-algorithm=default</strong> option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–stat[=&lt;width&gt;[,&lt;name-width&gt;[,&lt;count&gt;]]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generate a diffstat. By default, as much space as necessary will be used
for the filename part, and the rest for the graph part. Maximum width
defaults to terminal width, or 80 columns if not connected to a
terminal, and can be overridden by <strong>&lt;width&gt;</strong>. The width of the filename
part can be limited by giving another width <strong>&lt;name-width&gt;</strong> after a comma
or by setting <strong>diff.statNameWidth=&lt;width&gt;</strong>. The width of the graph part
can be limited by using <strong>–stat-graph-width=&lt;width&gt;</strong> or by setting
<strong>diff.statGraphWidth=&lt;width&gt;</strong>. Using <strong>–stat</strong> or <strong>–stat-graph-width</strong>
affects all commands generating a stat graph, while setting
<strong>diff.statNameWidth</strong> or <strong>diff.statGraphWidth</strong> does not affect <strong>git
format-patch</strong>. By giving a third parameter <strong>&lt;count&gt;</strong>, you can limit the
output to the first <strong>&lt;count&gt;</strong> lines, followed by <strong>…</strong> if there are
more.</p>
<p>
These parameters can also be set individually with
<strong>–stat-width=&lt;width&gt;</strong>, <strong>–stat-name-width=&lt;name-width&gt;</strong> and
<strong>–stat-count=&lt;count&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–compact-summary</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output a condensed summary of extended header information such as file
creations or deletions (&#34;new&#34; or &#34;gone&#34;, optionally &#34;+l&#34; if it&#39;s a
symlink) and mode changes (&#34;+x&#34; or &#34;-x&#34; for adding or removing
executable bit respectively) in diffstat. The information is put between
the filename part and the graph part. Implies <strong>–stat</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–numstat</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similar to <strong>–stat</strong>, but shows number of added and deleted lines in
decimal notation and pathname without abbreviation, to make it more
machine friendly. For binary files, outputs two <strong>-</strong> instead of saying <strong>0
0</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–shortstat</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output only the last line of the <strong>–stat</strong> format containing total number
of modified files, as well as number of added and deleted lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-X[&lt;param1,param2,…&gt;], –dirstat[=&lt;param1,param2,…&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output the distribution of relative amount of changes for each
sub-directory. The behavior of <strong>–dirstat</strong> can be customized by passing
it a comma separated list of parameters. The defaults are controlled by
the <strong>diff.dirstat</strong> configuration variable (see *git-config*(1)). The
following parameters are available:</p>
<p>
<strong>changes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have been removed
from the source, or added to the destination. This ignores the amount of
pure code movements within a file. In other words, rearranging lines in
a file is not counted as much as other changes. This is the default
behavior when no parameter is given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>lines</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line-based diff
analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts. (For binary files,
count 64-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no natural concept
of lines). This is a more expensive <strong>–dirstat</strong> behavior than the
<strong>changes</strong> behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a file as
much as other changes. The resulting output is consistent with what you
get from the other <strong>–*stat</strong> options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>files</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files changed.
Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis. This is the
computationally cheapest <strong>–dirstat</strong> behavior, since it does not have to
look at the file contents at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>cumulative</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory as well.
Note that when using <strong>cumulative</strong>, the sum of the percentages reported
may exceed 100%. The default (non-cumulative) behavior can be specified
with the <strong>noncumulative</strong> parameter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;limit&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by default).
Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes are
not shown in the output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring
directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and
accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
<strong>–dirstat=files,10,cumulative</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–cumulative</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synonym for –dirstat=cumulative</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–dirstat-by-file[=&lt;param1,param2&gt;…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synonym for –dirstat=files,&lt;param1&gt;,&lt;param2&gt;…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–summary</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output a condensed summary of extended header information such as
creations, renames and mode changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-renames</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration file gives the
default to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]rename-empty</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether to use empty blobs as rename source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–full-index</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full pre- and
post-image blob object names on the &#34;index&#34; line when generating patch
format output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–binary</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to <strong>–full-index</strong>, output a binary diff that can be applied
with <strong>git-apply</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object name in diff-raw
format output and diff-tree header lines, show the shortest prefix that
is at least <em>&lt;n&gt;</em> hexdigits long that uniquely refers the object. In
diff-patch output format, <strong>–full-index</strong> takes higher precedence, i.e.
if <strong>–full-index</strong> is specified, full blob names will be shown regardless
of <strong>–abbrev</strong>. Non default number of digits can be specified with
<strong>–abbrev=&lt;n&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-B[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;], –break-rewrites[=[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and create. This
serves two purposes:</p>
<p>
It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file
not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very few
lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single
deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything
new, and the number <strong>m</strong> controls this aspect of the -B option (defaults
to 60%). <strong>-B/70%</strong> specifies that less than 30% of the original should
remain in the result for Git to consider it a total rewrite (i.e.
otherwise the resulting patch will be a series of deletion and insertion
mixed together with context lines).</p>
<p>
When used with -M, a totally-rewritten file is also considered as the
source of a rename (usually -M only considers a file that disappeared as
the source of a rename), and the number <strong>n</strong> controls this aspect of the
-B option (defaults to 50%). <strong>-B20%</strong> specifies that a change with
addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file&#39;s size are
eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to another
file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-M[&lt;n&gt;], –find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Detect renames. If <strong>n</strong> is specified, it is a threshold on the similarity
index (i.e. amount of addition/deletions compared to the file&#39;s size).
For example, <strong>-M90%</strong> means Git should consider a delete/add pair to be a
rename if more than 90% of the file hasn&#39;t changed. Without a <strong>%</strong> sign,
the number is to be read as a fraction, with a decimal point before it.
I.e., <strong>-M5</strong> becomes 0.5, and is thus the same as <strong>-M50%</strong>. Similarly,
<strong>-M05</strong> is the same as <strong>-M5%</strong>. To limit detection to exact renames, use
<strong>-M100%</strong>. The default similarity index is 50%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-C[&lt;n&gt;], –find-copies[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Detect copies as well as renames. See also <strong>–find-copies-harder</strong>. If
<strong>n</strong> is specified, it has the same meaning as for <strong>-M&lt;n&gt;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–find-copies-harder</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For performance reasons, by default, <strong>-C</strong> option finds copies only if
the original file of the copy was modified in the same changeset. This
flag makes the command inspect unmodified files as candidates for the
source of copy. This is a very expensive operation for large projects,
so use it with caution. Giving more than one <strong>-C</strong> option has the same
effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-D, –irreversible-delete</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Omit the preimage for deletes, i.e. print only the header but not the
diff between the preimage and <strong>/dev/null</strong>. The resulting patch is not
meant to be applied with <strong>patch</strong> or <strong>git apply</strong>; this is solely for
people who want to just concentrate on reviewing the text after the
change. In addition, the output obviously lacks enough information to
apply such a patch in reverse, even manually, hence the name of the
option.</p>
<p>
When used together with <strong>-B</strong>, omit also the preimage in the deletion
part of a delete/create pair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-l&lt;num&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>-M</strong> and <strong>-C</strong> options involve some preliminary steps that can detect
subsets of renames/copies cheaply, followed by an exhaustive fallback
portion that compares all remaining unpaired destinations to all
relevant sources. (For renames, only remaining unpaired sources are
relevant; for copies, all original sources are relevant.) For N sources
and destinations, this exhaustive check is O(N^2). This option prevents
the exhaustive portion of rename/copy detection from running if the
number of source/destination files involved exceeds the specified
number. Defaults to diff.renameLimit. Note that a value of 0 is treated
as unlimited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-O&lt;orderfile&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Control the order in which files appear in the output. This overrides
the <strong>diff.orderFile</strong> configuration variable (see <strong>git-config*(1)). To
cancel *diff.orderFile</strong>, use <strong>-O/dev/null</strong>.</p>
<p>
The output order is determined by the order of glob patterns in
&lt;orderfile&gt;. All files with pathnames that match the first pattern are
output first, all files with pathnames that match the second pattern
(but not the first) are output next, and so on. All files with pathnames
that do not match any pattern are output last, as if there was an
implicit match-all pattern at the end of the file. If multiple pathnames
have the same rank (they match the same pattern but no earlier
patterns), their output order relative to each other is the normal
order.</p>
<p>
&lt;orderfile&gt; is parsed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Blank lines are ignored, so they can be used as separators for
readability.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Lines starting with a hash (&#34;<strong>#</strong>&#34;) are ignored, so they can be used for
comments. Add a backslash (&#34;<strong>\</strong>&#34;) to the beginning of the pattern if it
starts with a hash.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Each other line contains a single pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Patterns have the same syntax and semantics as patterns used for
fnmatch(3) without the FNM_PATHNAME flag, except a pathname also matches
a pattern if removing any number of the final pathname components
matches the pattern. For example, the pattern &#34;<strong>foo*bar</strong>&#34; matches
&#34;<strong>fooasdfbar</strong>&#34; and &#34;<strong>foo/bar/baz/asdf</strong>&#34; but not &#34;<strong>foobarx</strong>&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–skip-to=&lt;file&gt;, –rotate-to=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discard the files before the named &lt;file&gt; from the output (i.e. <em>skip
to</em>), or move them to the end of the output (i.e. <em>rotate to</em>). These
options were invented primarily for the use of the <strong>git difftool</strong>
command, and may not be very useful otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–relative[=&lt;path&gt;], –no-relative</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When run from a subdirectory of the project, it can be told to exclude
changes outside the directory and show pathnames relative to it with
this option. When you are not in a subdirectory (e.g. in a bare
repository), you can name which subdirectory to make the output relative
to by giving a &lt;path&gt; as an argument. <strong>–no-relative</strong> can be used to
countermand both <strong>diff.relative</strong> config option and previous
<strong>–relative</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-a, –text</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Treat all files as text.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignore-cr-at-eol</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore carriage-return at the end of line when doing a comparison.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignore-space-at-eol</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-b, –ignore-space-change</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore changes in amount of whitespace. This ignores whitespace at line
end, and considers all other sequences of one or more whitespace
characters to be equivalent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-w, –ignore-all-space</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores differences even if
one line has whitespace where the other line has none.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignore-blank-lines</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-I&lt;regex&gt;, –ignore-matching-lines=&lt;regex&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore changes whose all lines match &lt;regex&gt;. This option may be
specified more than once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–inter-hunk-context=&lt;lines&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified number of
lines, thereby fusing hunks that are close to each other. Defaults to
<strong>diff.interHunkContext</strong> or 0 if the config option is unset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-W, –function-context</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show whole function as context lines for each change. The function names
are determined in the same way as <strong>git diff</strong> works out patch hunk
headers (see <em>Defining a custom hunk-header</em> in *gitattributes*(5)).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ext-diff</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow an external diff helper to be executed. If you set an external
diff driver with *gitattributes*(5), you need to use this option with
*git-log*(1) and friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-ext-diff</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disallow external diff drivers.</p>

–textconv, –no-textconv</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow (or disallow) external text conversion filters to be run when
comparing binary files. See *gitattributes*(5) for details. Because
textconv filters are typically a one-way conversion, the resulting diff
is suitable for human consumption, but cannot be applied. For this
reason, textconv filters are enabled by default only for *git-diff*(1)
and *git-log*(1), but not for *git-format-patch*(1) or diff plumbing
commands.</p>

<p>
–ignore-submodules[=&lt;when&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation. &lt;when&gt; can be
either &#34;none&#34;, &#34;untracked&#34;, &#34;dirty&#34; or &#34;all&#34;, which is the default.
Using &#34;none&#34; will consider the submodule modified when it either
contains untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit
recorded in the superproject and can be used to override any settings of
the <em>ignore</em> option in *git-config*(1) or *gitmodules*(5). When
&#34;untracked&#34; is used submodules are not considered dirty when they only
contain untracked content (but they are still scanned for modified
content). Using &#34;dirty&#34; ignores all changes to the work tree of
submodules, only changes to the commits stored in the superproject are
shown (this was the behavior until 1.7.0). Using &#34;all&#34; hides all changes
to submodules.</p>

can be combined with the <strong>–numbered</strong> option.</p>
<p>
The configuration variable <strong>format.subjectPrefix</strong> may also be used to
configure a subject prefix to apply to a given repository for all
patches. This is often useful on mailing lists which receive patches for
several repositories and can be used to disambiguate the patches (with a
value of e.g. &#34;PATCH my-project&#34;).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–filename-max-length=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of the standard 64 bytes, chomp the generated output filenames
at around <em>&lt;n&gt;</em> bytes (too short a value will be silently raised to a
reasonable length). Defaults to the value of the
<strong>format.filenameMaxLength</strong> configuration variable, or 64 if
unconfigured.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–rfc[=&lt;rfc&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prepends the string <em>&lt;rfc&gt;</em> (defaults to &#34;RFC&#34;) to the subject prefix.
As the subject prefix defaults to &#34;PATCH&#34;, you&#39;ll get &#34;RFC PATCH&#34; by
default.</p>
<p>
RFC means &#34;Request For Comments&#34;; use this when sending an experimental
patch for discussion rather than application. &#34;–rfc=WIP&#34; may also be a
useful way to indicate that a patch is not complete yet (&#34;WIP&#34; stands
for &#34;Work In Progress&#34;).</p>
<p>
If the convention of the receiving community for a particular extra
string is to have it <em>after</em> the subject prefix, the string <em>&lt;rfc&gt;</em> can
be prefixed with a dash (&#34;<strong>-</strong>&#34;) to signal that the the rest of the
<em>&lt;rfc&gt;</em> string should be appended to the subject prefix instead, e.g.,
<strong>–rfc=-(WIP)</strong> results in &#34;PATCH (WIP)&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-v &lt;n&gt;, –reroll-count=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mark the series as the &lt;n&gt;-th iteration of the topic. The output
filenames have <strong>v&lt;n&gt;</strong> prepended to them, and the subject prefix (&#34;PATCH&#34;
by default, but configurable via the <strong>–subject-prefix</strong> option) has `
v&lt;n&gt;` appended to it. E.g. <strong>–reroll-count=4</strong> may produce
<strong>v4-0001-add-makefile.patch</strong> file that has &#34;Subject: [PATCH v4 1/20] Add
makefile&#34; in it. <strong>&lt;n&gt;</strong> does not have to be an integer (e.g.
&#34;–reroll-count=4.4&#34;, or &#34;–reroll-count=4rev2&#34; are allowed), but the
downside of using such a reroll-count is that the range-diff/interdiff
with the previous version does not state exactly which version the new
iteration is compared against.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–to=&lt;email&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add a <strong>To:</strong> header to the email headers. This is in addition to any
configured headers, and may be used multiple times. The negated form
<strong>–no-to</strong> discards all <strong>To:</strong> headers added so far (from config or
command line).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–cc=&lt;email&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add a <strong>Cc:</strong> header to the email headers. This is in addition to any
configured headers, and may be used multiple times. The negated form
<strong>–no-cc</strong> discards all <strong>Cc:</strong> headers added so far (from config or
command line).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–from, –from=&lt;ident&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use <strong>ident</strong> in the <strong>From:</strong> header of each commit email. If the author
ident of the commit is not textually identical to the provided <strong>ident</strong>,
place a <strong>From:</strong> header in the body of the message with the original
author. If no <strong>ident</strong> is given, use the committer ident.</p>
<p>
Note that this option is only useful if you are actually sending the
emails and want to identify yourself as the sender, but retain the
original author (and <strong>git am</strong> will correctly pick up the in-body
header). Note also that <strong>git send-email</strong> already handles this
transformation for you, and this option should not be used if you are
feeding the result to <strong>git send-email</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]force-in-body-from</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the e-mail sender specified via the <strong>–from</strong> option, by default, an
in-body &#34;From:&#34; to identify the real author of the commit is added at
the top of the commit log message if the sender is different from the
author. With this option, the in-body &#34;From:&#34; is added even when the
sender and the author have the same name and address, which may help if
the mailing list software mangles the sender&#39;s identity. Defaults to the
value of the <strong>format.forceInBodyFrom</strong> configuration variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–add-header=&lt;header&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add an arbitrary header to the email headers. This is in addition to any
configured headers, and may be used multiple times. For example,
<strong>–add-header=&#34;Organization: git-foo&#34;</strong>. The negated form
<strong>–no-add-header</strong> discards <strong>all</strong> (<strong>To:</strong>, <strong>Cc:</strong>, and custom) headers
added so far from config or command line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]cover-letter</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the patches, generate a cover letter file containing the
branch description, shortlog and the overall diffstat. You can fill in a
description in the file before sending it out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–encode-email-headers, –no-encode-email-headers</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Encode email headers that have non-ASCII characters with &#34;Q-encoding&#34;
(described in RFC 2047), instead of outputting the headers verbatim.
Defaults to the value of the <strong>format.encodeEmailHeaders</strong> configuration
variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–interdiff=&lt;previous&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a reviewer aid, insert an interdiff into the cover letter, or as
commentary of the lone patch of a 1-patch series, showing the
differences between the previous version of the patch series and the
series currently being formatted. <strong>previous</strong> is a single revision naming
the tip of the previous series which shares a common base with the
series being formatted (for example <strong>git format-patch –cover-letter
–interdiff=feature/v1 -3 feature/v2</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–range-diff=&lt;previous&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a reviewer aid, insert a range-diff (see *git-range-diff*(1)) into
the cover letter, or as commentary of the lone patch of a 1-patch
series, showing the differences between the previous version of the
patch series and the series currently being formatted. <strong>previous</strong> can be
a single revision naming the tip of the previous series if it shares a
common base with the series being formatted (for example <strong>git
format-patch –cover-letter –range-diff=feature/v1 -3 feature/v2</strong>), or
a revision range if the two versions of the series are disjoint (for
example <strong>git format-patch –cover-letter
–range-diff=feature/v1~3..feature/v1 -3 feature/v2</strong>).</p>
<p>
Note that diff options passed to the command affect how the primary
product of <strong>format-patch</strong> is generated, and they are not passed to the
underlying <strong>range-diff</strong> machinery used to generate the cover-letter
material (this may change in the future).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–creation-factor=&lt;percent&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Used with <strong>–range-diff</strong>, tweak the heuristic which matches up commits
between the previous and current series of patches by adjusting the
creation/deletion cost fudge factor. See *git-range-diff*(1)) for
details.</p>
<p>
Defaults to 999 (the *git-range-diff*(1) uses 60), as the use case is to
show comparison with an older iteration of the same topic and the tool
should find more correspondence between the two sets of patches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–notes[=&lt;ref&gt;], –no-notes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Append the notes (see *git-notes*(1)) for the commit after the
three-dash line.</p>
<p>
The expected use case of this is to write supporting explanation for the
commit that does not belong to the commit log message proper, and
include it with the patch submission. While one can simply write these
explanations after <strong>format-patch</strong> has run but before sending, keeping
them as Git notes allows them to be maintained between versions of the
patch series (but see the discussion of the <strong>notes.rewrite</strong>
configuration options in *git-notes*(1) to use this workflow).</p>
<p>
The default is <strong>–no-notes</strong>, unless the <strong>format.notes</strong> configuration is
set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]signature=&lt;signature&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add a signature to each message produced. Per RFC 3676 the signature is
separated from the body by a line with – on it. If the signature option
is omitted the signature defaults to the Git version number.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–signature-file=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Works just like –signature except the signature is read from a file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–suffix=.&lt;sfx&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of using <strong>.patch</strong> as the suffix for generated filenames, use
specified suffix. A common alternative is <strong>–suffix=.txt</strong>. Leaving this
empty will remove the <strong>.patch</strong> suffix.</p>
<p>
Note that the leading character does not have to be a dot; for example,
you can use <strong>–suffix=-patch</strong> to get
<strong>0001-description-of-my-change-patch</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-q, –quiet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not print the names of the generated files to standard output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-binary</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not output contents of changes in binary files, instead display a
notice that those files changed. Patches generated using this option
cannot be applied properly, but they are still useful for code review.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–zero-commit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Output an all-zero hash in each patch&#39;s From header instead of the hash
of the commit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–[no-]base[=&lt;commit&gt;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Record the base tree information to identify the state the patch series
applies to. See the BASE TREE INFORMATION section below for details. If
&lt;commit&gt; is &#34;auto&#34;, a base commit is automatically chosen. The
<strong>–no-base</strong> option overrides a <strong>format.useAutoBase</strong> configuration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–root</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Treat the revision argument as a &lt;revision-range&gt;, even if it is just a
single commit (that would normally be treated as a &lt;since&gt;). Note that
root commits included in the specified range are always formatted as
creation patches, independently of this flag.</p>

Typically it will be placed in a MUA&#39;s drafts folder, edited to add
timely commentary that should not go in the changelog after the three
dashes, and then sent as a message whose body, in our example, starts

save interesting patches in a UNIX mailbox and apply them with
*git-am*(1).</p>
<p>
When a patch is part of an ongoing discussion, the patch generated by
<em>git format-patch</em> can be tweaked to take advantage of the <em>git am
–scissors</em> feature. After your response to the discussion comes a line
that consists solely of &#34;<strong>– &gt;8 –</strong>&#34; (scissors and perforation),
followed by the patch with unnecessary header fields removed:</p>

When sending a patch this way, most often you are sending your own
patch, so in addition to the &#34;<strong>From $SHA1 $magic_timestamp</strong>&#34; marker you
should omit <strong>From:</strong> and <strong>Date:</strong> lines from the patch file. The patch
title is likely to be different from the subject of the discussion the
patch is in response to, so it is likely that you would want to keep the
Subject: line, like the example above.</p>

Checking for patch corruption
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Many mailers if not set up properly will corrupt whitespace. Here are
two common types of corruption:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Empty context lines that do not have <em>any</em> whitespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Non-empty context lines that have one extra whitespace at the beginning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
One way to test if your MUA is set up correctly is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Send the patch to yourself, exactly the way you would, except with To:
and Cc: lines that do not contain the list and maintainer address.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Save that patch to a file in UNIX mailbox format. Call it a.patch, say.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Apply it:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git fetch &lt;project&gt; master:test-apply
$ git switch test-apply
$ git restore --source=HEAD --staged --worktree :/
$ git am a.patch
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
If it does not apply correctly, there can be various reasons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
The patch itself does not apply cleanly. That is <em>bad</em> but does not have
much to do with your MUA. You might want to rebase the patch with
*git-rebase*(1) before regenerating it in this case.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
The MUA corrupted your patch; &#34;am&#34; would complain that the patch does
not apply. Look in the .git/rebase-apply/ subdirectory and see what
<em>patch</em> file contains and check for the common corruption patterns
mentioned above.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
While at it, check the <em>info</em> and <em>final-commit</em> files as well. If what
is in <em>final-commit</em> is not exactly what you would want to see in the
commit log message, it is very likely that the receiver would end up
hand editing the log message when applying your patch. Things like &#34;Hi,
this is my first patch.\n&#34; in the patch e-mail should come after the
three-dash line that signals the end of the commit message.</p>

wraps, configure Thunderbird to not mangle patches, or use an external
editor to keep Thunderbird from mangling the patches.</p>
<p>
\\</p>
<p>
<strong>Approach #1 (add-on)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Install the Toggle Word Wrap add-on that is available from
<strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/toggle-word-wrap/">https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/toggle-word-wrap/</a></strong> It adds
a menu entry &#34;Enable Word Wrap&#34; in the composer&#39;s &#34;Options&#34; menu that
you can tick off. Now you can compose the message as you otherwise do
(cut + paste, <em>git format-patch</em> | <em>git imap-send</em>, etc), but you have
to insert line breaks manually in any text that you type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
\\</p>
<p>
<strong>Approach #2 (configuration)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Configure your mail server composition as plain text: Edit…Account
Settings…Composition &amp; Addressing, uncheck &#34;Compose Messages in HTML&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Configure your general composition window to not wrap.</p>
<p>
In Thunderbird 2: Edit..Preferences..Composition, wrap plain text
messages at 0</p>
<p>
In Thunderbird 3: Edit..Preferences..Advanced..Config Editor. Search for
&#34;mail.wrap_long_lines&#34;. Toggle it to make sure it is set to <strong>false</strong>.
Also, search for &#34;mailnews.wraplength&#34; and set the value to 0.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Disable the use of format=flowed: Edit..Preferences..Advanced..Config
Editor. Search for &#34;mailnews.send_plaintext_flowed&#34;. Toggle it to make
sure it is set to <strong>false</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
After that is done, you should be able to compose email as you otherwise
would (cut + paste, <em>git format-patch</em> | <em>git imap-send</em>, etc), and the
patches will not be mangled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
\\</p>
<p>
<strong>Approach #3 (external editor)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following Thunderbird extensions are needed: AboutConfig from
<strong><a href="https://mjg.github.io/AboutConfig/">https://mjg.github.io/AboutConfig/</a></strong> and External Editor from
<strong><a href="https://globs.org/articles.php?lng=en&amp;pg=8">https://globs.org/articles.php?lng=en&amp;pg=8</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Prepare the patch as a text file using your method of choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Before opening a compose window, use Edit→Account Settings to uncheck
the &#34;Compose messages in HTML format&#34; setting in the &#34;Composition &amp;
Addressing&#34; panel of the account to be used to send the patch.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>In the main Thunderbird window, <em>before</em> you open the compose window for
the patch, use Tools→about:config to set the following to the indicated
values:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        mailnews.send_plaintext_flowed  =&gt; false
        mailnews.wraplength             =&gt; 0
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Open a compose window and click the external editor icon.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>In the external editor window, read in the patch file and exit the
editor normally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Side note: it may be possible to do step 2 with about:config and the
following settings but no one&#39;s tried yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
        mail.html_compose                       =&gt; false
        mail.identity.default.compose_html      =&gt; false
        mail.identity.id?.compose_html          =&gt; false
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is a script in contrib/thunderbird-patch-inline which can help you
include patches with Thunderbird in an easy way. To use it, do the steps
above and then use the script as the external editor.</p>

<li></li>

<p>Click on New Mail.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Go under &#34;Options&#34; in the Composer window and be sure that &#34;Word wrap&#34;
is not set.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Use Message → Insert file… and insert the patch.</p>

BASE TREE INFORMATION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The base tree information block is used for maintainers or third party
testers to know the exact state the patch series applies to. It consists
of the <em>base commit</em>, which is a well-known commit that is part of the
stable part of the project history everybody else works off of, and zero
or more <em>prerequisite patches</em>, which are well-known patches in flight
that is not yet part of the <em>base commit</em> that need to be applied on top
of <em>base commit</em> in topological order before the patches can be applied.</p>
<p>
The <em>base commit</em> is shown as &#34;base-commit: &#34; followed by the 40-hex of
the commit object name. A <em>prerequisite patch</em> is shown as
&#34;prerequisite-patch-id: &#34; followed by the 40-hex <em>patch id</em>, which can
be obtained by passing the patch through the <strong>git patch-id –stable</strong>
command.</p>
<p>
Imagine that on top of the public commit P, you applied well-known
patches X, Y and Z from somebody else, and then built your three-patch
series A, B, C, the history would be like:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
---P---X---Y---Z---A---B---C
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
With <strong>git format-patch –base=P -3 C</strong> (or variants thereof, e.g. with
<strong>–cover-letter</strong> or using <strong>Z..C</strong> instead of <strong>-3 C</strong> to specify the
range), the base tree information block is shown at the end of the first
message the command outputs (either the first patch, or the cover
letter), like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
base-commit: P
prerequisite-patch-id: X
prerequisite-patch-id: Y
prerequisite-patch-id: Z
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
For non-linear topology, such as</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
---P---X---A---M---C
    \         /
     Y---Z---B
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
You can also use <strong>git format-patch –base=P -3 C</strong> to generate patches
for A, B and C, and the identifiers for P, X, Y, Z are appended at the
end of the first message.</p>
<p>
If set <strong>–base=auto</strong> in cmdline, it will automatically compute the base
commit as the merge base of tip commit of the remote-tracking branch and
revision-range specified in cmdline. For a local branch, you need to
make it to track a remote branch by <strong>git branch –set-upstream-to</strong>
before using this option.</p>

EXAMPLES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-2">
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Extract commits between revisions R1 and R2, and apply them on top of
the current branch using <em>git am</em> to cherry-pick them:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git format-patch -k --stdout R1..R2 | git am -3 -k
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Extract all commits which are in the current branch but not in the
origin branch:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git format-patch origin
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
For each commit a separate file is created in the current directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Extract all commits that lead to <em>origin</em> since the inception of the
project:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git format-patch --root origin
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
The same as the previous one:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git format-patch -M -B origin
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Additionally, it detects and handles renames and complete rewrites
intelligently to produce a renaming patch. A renaming patch reduces the
amount of text output, and generally makes it easier to review. Note
that non-Git &#34;patch&#34; programs won&#39;t understand renaming patches, so use
it only when you know the recipient uses Git to apply your patch.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
Extract three topmost commits from the current branch and format them as
e-mailable patches:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git format-patch -3
</pre>
</blockquote>

CAVEATS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Note that <strong>format-patch</strong> will omit merge commits from the output, even
if they are part of the requested range. A simple &#34;patch&#34; does not
include enough information for the receiving end to reproduce the same
merge commit.</p>
