DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>systemd-creds</strong> is a tool for listing, showing, encrypting and
decrypting unit credentials. Credentials are limited-size binary or
textual objects that may be passed to unit processes. They are primarily
used for passing cryptographic keys (both public and private) or
certificates, user account information or identity information from the
host to services.</p>
<p>
Credentials are configured in unit files via the <em>ImportCredential=</em>,
<em>LoadCredential=</em>, <em>SetCredential=</em>, <em>LoadCredentialEncrypted=</em>, and
<em>SetCredentialEncrypted=</em> settings, see *systemd.exec*(5) for details.</p>
<p>
For further information see <strong>System and Service Credentials</strong>[1]
documentation.</p>

COMMANDS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The following commands are understood:</p>
<p>
<strong>list</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show a list of credentials passed into the current execution context.
This command shows the files in the directory referenced by the
<em>$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY</em> environment variable, and is intended to be
executed from within service context.</p>
<p>
Along with each credential name, the size and security state is shown.
The latter is one of &#34;secure&#34; (in case the credential is backed by
unswappable memory, i.e. &#34;ramfs&#34;), &#34;weak&#34; (in case it is backed by any
other type of memory), or &#34;insecure&#34; (if having any access mode that is
not 0400, i.e. if readable by anyone but the owner).</p>
<p>
Added in version 250.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>cat</strong> <em>credential…</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show contents of specified credentials passed into the current execution
context. Takes one or more credential names, whose contents shall be
written to standard output.</p>
<p>
When combined with <strong>–json=</strong> or <strong>–transcode=</strong> the output is transcoded
in simple ways before outputting.</p>
<p>
Added in version 250.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>setup</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generates a host encryption key for credentials, if one has not been
generated already. This ensures the /var/lib/systemd/credential.secret
file is initialized with a random secret key if it doesnt exist yet.
This secret key is used when encrypting/decrypting credentials with
<strong>encrypt</strong> or <strong>decrypt</strong>, and is only accessible to the root user. Note
that theres typically no need to invoke this command explicitly as it is
implicitly called when <strong>encrypt</strong> is invoked, and credential host key
encryption selected.</p>
<p>
Added in version 250.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>encrypt</strong> <em>input|-</em> <em>output|-</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Loads the specified (unencrypted plaintext) input credential file,
encrypts it and writes the (encrypted ciphertext) output to the
specified target credential file. The resulting file may be referenced
in the <em>LoadCredentialEncrypted=</em> setting in unit files, or its contents
used literally in <em>SetCredentialEncrypted=</em> settings.</p>
<p>
Takes two file system paths. The file name part of the output path is
embedded as name in the encrypted credential, to ensure encrypted
credentials cannot be renamed and reused for different purposes without
this being noticed. The credential name to embed may be overridden with
the <strong>–name=</strong> setting. The input or output paths may be specified as
&#34;-&#34;, in which case the credential data is read from/written to standard
input and standard output. If the output path is specified as &#34;-&#34; the
credential name cannot be derived from the file system path, and thus
should be specified explicitly via the <strong>–name=</strong> switch.</p>
<p>
The credential data is encrypted and authenticated symmetrically with
one of the following encryption keys:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>A secret key automatically derived from the systems TPM2 chip. This
encryption key is not stored on the host system and thus decryption is
only possible with access to the original TPM2 chip. Or in other words,
the credential secured in this way can only be decrypted again by the
local machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>A secret key stored in the /var/lib/systemd/credential.secret file which
is only accessible to the root user. This &#34;host&#34; encryption key is
stored on the host file system, and thus decryption is possible with
access to the host file system and sufficient privileges. The key is
automatically generated when needed, but can also be created explicitly
with the <strong>setup</strong> command, see above.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>A combination of the above: an encryption key derived from both the TPM2
chip and the host file system. This means decryption requires both
access to the original TPM2 chip and the OS installation. This is the
default mode of operation if a TPM2 chip is available and
<em>var/lib/systemd</em> resides on persistent media.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Which of the three keys shall be used for encryption may be configured
with the <strong>–with-key=</strong> switch. Depending on the use-case for the
encrypted credential the key to use may differ. For example, for
credentials that shall be accessible from the initrd, encryption with
the host key is not appropriate, since access to the host key is
typically not available from the initrd. Thus, for such credentials only
the TPM2 key should be used.</p>
<p>
Encrypted credentials are always encoded in Base64.</p>
<p>
Use <strong>decrypt</strong> (see below) to undo the encryption operation, and acquire
the decrypted plaintext credential from the encrypted ciphertext
credential.</p>
<p>
The credential data is encrypted using AES256-GCM, i.e. providing both
confidentiality and integrity, keyed by a SHA256 hash of one or both of
the secret keys described above.</p>
<p>
Added in version 250.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>decrypt</strong> <em>input|-</em> [/output|-/]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Undoes the effect of the <strong>encrypt</strong> operation: loads the specified
(encrypted ciphertext) input credential file, decrypts and authenticates
it and writes the (decrypted plaintext) output to the specified target
credential file.</p>
<p>
Takes one or two file system paths. The file name part of the input path
is compared with the credential name embedded in the encrypted file. If
it does not match decryption fails. This is done in order to ensure that
encrypted credentials are not re-purposed without this being detected.
The credential name to compare with the embedded credential name may
also be overridden with the <strong>–name=</strong> switch. If the input path is
specified as &#34;-&#34;, the encrypted credential is read from standard input.
If only one path is specified or the output path specified as &#34;-&#34;, the
decrypted credential is written to standard output. In this mode, the
expected name embedded in the credential cannot be derived from the path
and should be specified explicitly with <strong>–name=</strong>.</p>
<p>
Decrypting credentials requires access to the original TPM2 chip and/or
credentials host key, see above. Information about which keys are
required is embedded in the encrypted credential data, and thus
decryption is entirely automatic.</p>
<p>
Added in version 250.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>has-tpm2</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reports whether the system is equipped with a TPM2 device usable for
protecting credentials. If a TPM2 device has been discovered, is
supported, and is being used by firmware, by the OS kernel drivers and
by userspace (i.e. systemd) this prints &#34;yes&#34; and exits with exit status
zero. If no such device is discovered/supported/used, prints &#34;no&#34;.
Otherwise prints &#34;partial&#34;. In either of these two cases exits with
non-zero exit status. It also shows four lines indicating separately
whether firmware, drivers, the system and the kernel
discovered/support/use TPM2.</p>
<p>
Combine with <strong>–quiet</strong> to suppress the output.</p>
<p>
Added in version 251.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>-h</strong>, <strong>–help</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short help text and exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–version</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Print a short version string and exit.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>–system</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified with the <strong>list</strong> and <strong>cat</strong> commands operates on the
credentials passed to system as a whole instead of on those passed to
the current execution context. This is useful in container environments
where credentials may be passed in from the container manager.</p>
<p>
Added in version 250.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–user</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified with the <strong>encrypt</strong> and <strong>decrypt</strong> commands encrypts a
user-scoped (rather than a system-scoped) credential. Use <strong>–uid=</strong> to
select which user the credential is from. Such credentials may only be
decrypted from the specified users context, except if privileges can be
acquired. Generally, when an encrypted credential shall be used in the
per-user service manager it should be encrypted with this option set,
when it shall be used in the system service manager it should be
encrypted without.</p>
<p>
Internally, this ensures that the selected users numeric UID and
username, as well as the systems *machine-id*(5) are incorporated into
the encryption key.</p>
<p>
Added in version 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–uid=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies the user to encrypt the credential for. Takes a user name or
numeric UID. If set, implies <strong>–user</strong>. If set to the special string
&#34;self&#34; sets the user to the user of the calling process. If <strong>–user</strong> is
used without <strong>–uid=</strong> then <strong>–uid=self</strong> is implied, i.e. the credential
is encrypted for the calling user.</p>
<p>
Added in version 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–transcode=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified with the <strong>cat</strong> or <strong>decrypt</strong> commands, transcodes the
output before showing it. Takes one of &#34;base64&#34;, &#34;unbase64&#34;, &#34;hex&#34; or
&#34;unhex&#34; as argument, in order to encode/decode the credential data with
Base64 or as series of hexadecimal values.</p>
<p>
Note that this has no effect on the <strong>encrypt</strong> command, as encrypted
credentials are unconditionally encoded in Base64.</p>
<p>
Added in version 250.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–newline=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified with <strong>cat</strong> or <strong>decrypt</strong> controls whether to add a
trailing newline character to the end of the output if it doesnt end in
one, anyway. Takes one of &#34;auto&#34;, &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;no&#34;. The default mode of
&#34;auto&#34; will suffix the output with a single newline character only when
writing credential data to a TTY.</p>
<p>
Added in version 250.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–pretty</strong>, <strong>-p</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified with <strong>encrypt</strong> controls whether to show the encrypted
credential as <em>SetCredentialEncrypted=</em> setting that may be pasted
directly into a unit file. Has effect only when used together with
<strong>–name=</strong> and &#34;-&#34; as the output file.</p>
<p>
Added in version 250.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–name=*/name/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified with the <strong>encrypt</strong> command controls the credential name
to embed in the encrypted credential data. If not specified the name is
chosen automatically from the filename component of the specified output
path. If specified as empty string no credential name is embedded in the
encrypted credential, and no verification of credential name is done
when the credential is decrypted.</p>
<p>
When specified with the <strong>decrypt</strong> command control the credential name to
validate the credential name embedded in the encrypted credential with.
If not specified the name is chosen automatically from the filename
component of the specified input path. If no credential name is embedded
in the encrypted credential file (i.e. the <strong>–name=</strong> with an empty
string was used when encrypted) the specified name has no effect as no
credential name validation is done.</p>
<p>
Embedding the credential name in the encrypted credential is done in
order to protect against reuse of credentials for purposes they werent
originally intended for, under the assumption the credential name is
chosen carefully to encode its intended purpose.</p>
<p>
Added in version 250.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–timestamp=*/timestamp/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified with the <strong>encrypt</strong> command controls the timestamp to
embed into the encrypted credential. Defaults to the current time. Takes
a timestamp specification in the format described in *systemd.time*(7).</p>
<p>
When specified with the <strong>decrypt</strong> command controls the timestamp to use
to validate the &#34;not-after&#34; timestamp that was configured with
<strong>–not-after=</strong> during encryption. If not specified defaults to the
current system time.</p>
<p>
Added in version 250.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–not-after=*/timestamp/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified with the <strong>encrypt</strong> command controls the time when the
credential shall not be used anymore. This embeds the specified
timestamp in the encrypted credential. During decryption the timestamp
is checked against the current system clock, and if the timestamp is in
the past the decryption will fail. By default no such timestamp is set.
Takes a timestamp specification in the format described in
*systemd.time*(7).</p>
<p>
Added in version 250.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–with-key=</strong>, <strong>-H</strong>, <strong>-T</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified with the <strong>encrypt</strong> command controls the
encryption/signature key to use. Takes one of &#34;host&#34;, &#34;tpm2&#34;,
&#34;host+tpm2&#34;, &#34;null&#34;, &#34;auto&#34;, &#34;auto-initrd&#34;. See above for details on the
three key types. If set to &#34;auto&#34; (which is the default) the TPM2 key is
used if a TPM2 device is found and not running in a container. The host
key is used if <em>var/lib/systemd</em> is on persistent media. This means on
typical systems the encryption is by default bound to both the TPM2 chip
and the OS installation, and both need to be available to decrypt the
credential again. If &#34;auto&#34; is selected but neither TPM2 is available
(or running in container) nor <em>var/lib/systemd</em> is on persistent media,
encryption will fail. If set to &#34;null&#34; a fixed zero length key is used
(thus, in this mode no confidentiality nor authenticity are provided!).
This logic is useful to cover for systems that lack a TPM2 chip but
where credentials shall be generated. Note that decryption of such
credentials is refused on systems that have a TPM2 chip and where UEFI
SecureBoot is enabled (this is done so that such a locked down system
cannot be tricked into loading a credential generated this way that
lacks authentication information). If set to &#34;auto-initrd&#34; a TPM2 key is
used if a TPM2 is found. If not a fixed zero length key is used,
equivalent to &#34;null&#34; mode. This option is particularly useful to
generate credentials files that are encrypted/authenticated against TPM2
where available but still work on systems lacking support for this.</p>
<p>
The <strong>-H</strong> switch is a shortcut for <strong>–with-key=host</strong>. Similar, <strong>-T</strong> is a
shortcut for <strong>–with-key=tpm2</strong>.</p>
<p>
When encrypting credentials that shall be used in the initrd (where
<em>var/lib/systemd</em> is typically not available) make sure to use
<strong>–with-key=auto-initrd</strong> mode, to disable binding against the host
secret.</p>
<p>
This switch has no effect on the <strong>decrypt</strong> command, as information on
which key to use for decryption is included in the encrypted credential
already.</p>
<p>
Added in version 250.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–tpm2-device=*/PATH/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Controls the TPM2 device to use. Expects a device node path referring to
the TPM2 chip (e.g. /dev/tpmrm0). Alternatively the special value &#34;auto&#34;
may be specified, in order to automatically determine the device node of
a suitable TPM2 device (of which there must be exactly one). The special
value &#34;list&#34; may be used to enumerate all suitable TPM2 devices
currently discovered.</p>
<p>
Added in version 250.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–tpm2-pcrs=*/PCR[+PCR…]/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures the TPM2 PCRs (Platform Configuration Registers) to bind the
encryption key to. Takes a &#34;+&#34; separated list of numeric PCR indexes in
the range 0…23. If not used, defaults to PCR 7 only. If an empty
string is specified, binds the encryption key to no PCRs at all. For
details about the PCRs available, see the documentation of the switch of
the same name for *systemd-cryptenroll*(1).</p>
<p>
Added in version 250.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–tpm2-public-key=*/PATH/, *–tpm2-public-key-pcrs=*/PCR[+PCR…]/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configures a TPM2 signed PCR policy to bind encryption to, for use with
the <strong>encrypt</strong> command. The <strong>–tpm2-public-key=</strong> option accepts a path to
a PEM encoded RSA public key, to bind the encryption to. If this is not
specified explicitly, but a file tpm2-pcr-public-key.pem exists in one
of the directories <em>etc/systemd</em>, <em>run/systemd</em>, <em>usr/lib/systemd</em>
(searched in this order), it is automatically used. The
<strong>–tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</strong> option takes a list of TPM2 PCR indexes to
bind to (same syntax as <strong>–tpm2-pcrs=</strong> described above). If not
specified defaults to 11 (i.e. this binds the policy to any unified
kernel image for which a PCR signature can be provided).</p>
<p>
Note the difference between <strong>–tpm2-pcrs=</strong> and
<strong>–tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</strong>: the former binds decryption to the current,
specific PCR values; the latter binds decryption to any set of PCR
values for which a signature by the specified public key can be
provided. The latter is hence more useful in scenarios where software
updates shall be possible without losing access to all previously
encrypted secrets.</p>
<p>
Added in version 252.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–tpm2-signature=*/PATH/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a path to a TPM2 PCR signature file as generated by the
<strong>systemd-measure*(1) tool and that may be used to allow the *decrypt</strong>
command to decrypt credentials that are bound to specific signed PCR
values. If this is not specified explicitly, and a credential with a
signed PCR policy is attempted to be decrypted, a suitable signature
file tpm2-pcr-signature.json is searched for in <em>etc/systemd</em>,
<em>run/systemd</em>, <em>usr/lib/systemd</em> (in this order) and used.</p>
<p>
Added in version 252.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–allow-null</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allow decrypting credentials that use an empty key.</p>
<p>
Added in version 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–quiet</strong>, <strong>-q</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When used with <strong>has-tpm2</strong> suppresses the output, and only returns an
exit status indicating support for TPM2.</p>
<p>
Added in version 251.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–no-pager</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not pipe output into a pager.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–no-legend</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer with hints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–json=*/MODE/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of &#34;short&#34; (for the shortest
possible output without any redundant whitespace or line breaks),
&#34;pretty&#34; (for a pretty version of the same, with indentation and line
breaks) or &#34;off&#34; (to turn off JSON output, the default).</p>

EXIT STATUS

<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>On success, 0 is returned.</p>
<p>
In case of the <strong>has-tpm2</strong> command returns 0 if a TPM2 device is
discovered, supported and used by firmware, driver, and userspace (i.e.
systemd). Otherwise returns the OR combination of the value 1 (in case
firmware support is missing), 2 (in case driver support is missing) and
4 (in case userspace support is missing). If no TPM2 support is
available at all, value 7 is hence returned.</p>

EXAMPLES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>Example 1. Encrypt a password for use as credential</strong></p>
<p>
The following command line encrypts the specified password &#34;hunter2&#34;,
writing the result to a file password.cred.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# echo -n hunter2 | systemd-creds encrypt - password.cred
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This decrypts the file password.cred again, revealing the literal
password:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
# systemd-creds decrypt password.cred
hunter2
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Example 2. Encrypt a password and include it in a unit file</strong></p>
<p>
The following command line prompts the user for a password and generates
a <em>SetCredentialEncrypted=</em> line from it for a credential named
&#34;mysql-password&#34;, suitable for inclusion in a unit file.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">

<p>
The generated line can be pasted 1:1 into a unit file, and will ensure
the acquired password will be made available in the
/$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY//mysql-password credential file for the started
service.</p>
<p>
Utilizing the unit file drop-in logic this can be used to securely pass
a password credential to a unit. A similar, more comprehensive set of
commands to insert a password into a service xyz.service:</p>
<blockquote>
