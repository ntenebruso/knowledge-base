DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking. The &#34;overall options&#34; allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage. For example, the <strong>-c</strong> option says not
to run the linker. Then the output consists of object files output by
the assembler.</p>
<p>
Other options are passed on to one or more stages of processing. Some
options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself. Yet
other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.</p>
<p>
Most of the command-line options that you can use with GCC are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly. If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.</p>
<p>
The usual way to run GCC is to run the executable called <strong>gcc</strong>, or
<em>machine/*-gcc* when cross-compiling, or /machine/*-gcc-*/version</em> to
run a specific version of GCC. When you compile C++ programs, you should
invoke GCC as <strong>g++</strong> instead.</p>
<p>
The <strong>gcc</strong> program accepts options and file names as operands. Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter
options may <em>not</em> be grouped: <strong>-dv</strong> is very different from <strong>-d -v</strong>.</p>
<p>
You can mix options and other arguments. For the most part, the order
you use doesn&#39;t matter. Order does matter when you use several options
of the same kind; for example, if you specify <strong>-L</strong> more than once, the
directories are searched in the order specified. Also, the placement of
the <strong>-l</strong> option is significant.</p>
<p>
Many options have long names starting with <strong>-f</strong> or with <strong>-W</strong>—for
example, <strong>-fmove-loop-invariants</strong>, <strong>-Wformat</strong> and so on. Most of these
have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of <strong>-ffoo</strong> is
<strong>-fno-foo</strong>. This manual documents only one of these two forms, whichever
one is not the default.</p>
<p>
Some options take one or more arguments typically separated either by a
space or by the equals sign (<strong>=</strong>) from the option name. Unless
documented otherwise, an argument can be either numeric or a string.
Numeric arguments must typically be small unsigned decimal or
hexadecimal integers. Hexadecimal arguments must begin with the <strong>0x</strong>
prefix. Arguments to options that specify a size threshold of some sort
may be arbitrarily large decimal or hexadecimal integers followed by a
byte size suffix designating a multiple of bytes such as <code class="verbatim">kB</code> and <code class="verbatim">KiB</code>
for kilobyte and kibibyte, respectively, <code class="verbatim">MB</code> and <code class="verbatim">MiB</code> for megabyte and
mebibyte, <code class="verbatim">GB</code> and <code class="verbatim">GiB</code> for gigabyte and gigibyte, and so on. Such
arguments are designated by <em>byte-size</em> in the following text. Refer to
the NIST, IEC, and other relevant national and international standards
for the full listing and explanation of the binary and decimal byte size
prefixes.</p>

Options Controlling the Kind of Output

<p>Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order. GCC is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several assembler
input files, or into one assembler input file; then each assembler input
file produces an object file, and linking combines all the object files
(those newly compiled, and those specified as input) into an executable
file.</p>
<p>
For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:</p>

<dd>Specify explicitly the <em>language</em> for the following
input files (rather than letting the compiler choose a default based
on the file name suffix). This option applies to all following input
files until the next <strong>-x</strong> option. Possible values for <em>language</em> are:
c c-header cpp-output c++ c++-header c++-system-header c++-user-header
c++-cpp-output objective-c objective-c-header objective-c-cpp-output
objective-c++ objective-c++-header objective-c++-cpp-output assembler
assembler-with-cpp ada d f77 f77-cpp-input f95 f95-cpp-input go</dd>
<dt>
-x none
</dt>
<dd>Turn off any specification of a language, so that
subsequent files are handled according to their file name suffixes (as
they are if <strong>-x</strong> has not been used at all).</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use <strong>-x</strong> (or
filename suffixes) to tell <strong>gcc</strong> where to start, and one of the options
<strong>-c</strong>, <strong>-S</strong>, or <strong>-E</strong> to say where <strong>gcc</strong> is to stop. Note that some
combinations (for example, <strong>-x cpp-output -E</strong>) instruct <strong>gcc</strong> to do
nothing at all.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-c
</dt>
<dd>Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link. The
linking stage simply is not done. The ultimate output is in the form
of an object file for each source file. By default, the object file
name for a source file is made by replacing the suffix <strong>.c</strong>, <strong>.i</strong>,
<strong>.s</strong>, etc., with <strong>.o</strong>. Unrecognized input files, not requiring
compilation or assembly, are ignored.</dd>
<dt>
-S
</dt>
<dd>Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble. The
output is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler
input file specified. By default, the assembler file name for a source
file is made by replacing the suffix <strong>.c</strong>, <strong>.i</strong>, etc., with <strong>.s</strong>.
Input files that don&#39;t require compilation are ignored.</dd>
<dt>
-E
</dt>
<dd>Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler
proper. The output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which
is sent to the standard output. Input files that don&#39;t require
preprocessing are ignored.</dd>
<dt>
-o file
</dt>
<dd>Place the primary output in file <em>file</em>. This applies to
whatever sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable
file, an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code. If
<strong>-o</strong> is not specified, the default is to put an executable file in
<em>a.out</em>, the object file for <em>source.suffix</em> in <em>source.o</em>, its
assembler file in <em>source.s</em>, a precompiled header file in
<em>source.suffix.gch</em>, and all preprocessed C source on standard output.
Though <strong>-o</strong> names only the primary output, it also affects the naming
of auxiliary and dump outputs. See the examples below. Unless
overridden, both auxiliary outputs and dump outputs are placed in the
same directory as the primary output. In auxiliary outputs, the suffix
of the input file is replaced with that of the auxiliary output file
type; in dump outputs, the suffix of the dump file is appended to the
input file suffix. In compilation commands, the base name of both
auxiliary and dump outputs is that of the primary output; in compile
and link commands, the primary output name, minus the executable
suffix, is combined with the input file name. If both share the same
base name, disregarding the suffix, the result of the combination is
that base name, otherwise, they are concatenated, separated by a dash.
gcc -c foo.c … will use <em>foo.o</em> as the primary output, and place aux
outputs and dumps next to it, e.g., aux file <em>foo.dwo</em> for
<strong>-gsplit-dwarf</strong>, and dump file <em>foo.c.???r.final</em> for
<strong>-fdump-rtl-final</strong>. If a non-linker output file is explicitly
specified, aux and dump files by default take the same base name: gcc
-c foo.c -o dir/foobar.o … will name aux outputs <em>dir/foobar.*</em> and
dump outputs <em>dir/foobar.c.*</em>. A linker output will instead prefix aux
and dump outputs: gcc foo.c bar.c -o dir/foobar … will generally
name aux outputs <em>dir/foobar-foo.*</em> and <em>dir/foobar-bar.*</em>, and dump
outputs <em>dir/foobar-foo.c.*</em> and <em>dir/foobar-bar.c.*</em>. The one
exception to the above is when the executable shares the base name
with the single input: gcc foo.c -o dir/foo … in which case aux
outputs are named <em>dir/foo.*</em> and dump outputs named <em>dir/foo.c.*</em>.
The location and the names of auxiliary and dump outputs can be
adjusted by the options <strong>-dumpbase</strong>, <strong>-dumpbase-ext</strong>, <strong>-dumpdir</strong>,
<strong>-save-temps=cwd</strong>, and <strong>-save-temps=obj</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-dumpbase dumpbase
</dt>
<dd>This option sets the base name for auxiliary and
dump output files. It does not affect the name of the primary output
file. Intermediate outputs, when preserved, are not regarded as
primary outputs, but as auxiliary outputs: gcc -save-temps -S foo.c
saves the (no longer) temporary preprocessed file in <em>foo.i</em>, and then
compiles to the (implied) output file <em>foo.s</em>, whereas: gcc
-save-temps -dumpbase save-foo -c foo.c preprocesses to in
<em>save-foo.i</em>, compiles to <em>save-foo.s</em> (now an intermediate, thus
auxiliary output), and then assembles to the (implied) output file
<em>foo.o</em>. Absent this option, dump and aux files take their names from
the input file, or from the (non-linker) output file, if one is
explicitly specified: dump output files (e.g. those requested by
<strong>-fdump-*</strong> options) with the input name suffix, and aux output files
(those requested by other non-dump options, e.g. <code class="verbatim">-save-temps</code>,
<code class="verbatim">-gsplit-dwarf</code>, <code class="verbatim">-fcallgraph-info</code>) without it. Similar suffix
differentiation of dump and aux outputs can be attained for
explicitly-given <strong>-dumpbase basename.suf</strong> by also specifying
<strong>-dumpbase-ext .suf</strong>. If <em>dumpbase</em> is explicitly specified with any
directory component, any <em>dumppfx</em> specification (e.g. <strong>-dumpdir</strong> or
<strong>-save-temps=*</strong>) is ignored, and instead of appending to it,
<em>dumpbase</em> fully overrides it: gcc foo.c -c -o dir/foo.o -dumpbase
alt/foo \ -dumpdir pfx- -save-temps=cwd … creates auxiliary and dump
outputs named <em>alt/foo.*</em>, disregarding <em>dir/</em> in <strong>-o</strong>, the <em>./</em>
prefix implied by <strong>-save-temps=cwd</strong>, and <em>pfx-</em> in <strong>-dumpdir</strong>. When
<strong>-dumpbase</strong> is specified in a command that compiles multiple inputs,
or that compiles and then links, it may be combined with <em>dumppfx</em>, as
specified under <strong>-dumpdir</strong>. Then, each input file is compiled using
the combined <em>dumppfx</em>, and default values for <em>dumpbase</em> and
<em>auxdropsuf</em> are computed for each input file: gcc foo.c bar.c -c
-dumpbase main … creates <em>foo.o</em> and <em>bar.o</em> as primary outputs, and
avoids overwriting the auxiliary and dump outputs by using the
<em>dumpbase</em> as a prefix, creating auxiliary and dump outputs named
<em>main-foo.*</em> and <em>main-bar.*</em>. An empty string specified as <em>dumpbase</em>
avoids the influence of the output basename in the naming of auxiliary
and dump outputs during compilation, computing default values : gcc -c
foo.c -o dir/foobar.o -dumpbase &#34; … will name aux outputs
<em>dir/foo.*</em> and dump outputs <em>dir/foo.c.*</em>. Note how their basenames
are taken from the input name, but the directory still defaults to
that of the output. The empty-string dumpbase does not prevent the use
of the output basename for outputs during linking: gcc foo.c bar.c -o
dir/foobar -dumpbase &#34; -flto … The compilation of the source files
will name auxiliary outputs <em>dir/foo.*</em> and <em>dir/bar.*</em>, and dump
outputs <em>dir/foo.c.*</em> and <em>dir/bar.c.*</em>. LTO recompilation during
linking will use <em>dir/foobar.</em> as the prefix for dumps and auxiliary
files.</dd>
<dt>
-dumpbase-ext auxdropsuf
</dt>
<dd>When forming the name of an auxiliary (but
not a dump) output file, drop trailing <em>auxdropsuf</em> from <em>dumpbase</em>
before appending any suffixes. If not specified, this option defaults
to the suffix of a default <em>dumpbase</em>, i.e., the suffix of the input
file when <strong>-dumpbase</strong> is not present in the command line, or
<em>dumpbase</em> is combined with <em>dumppfx</em>. gcc foo.c -c -o dir/foo.o
-dumpbase x-foo.c -dumpbase-ext .c … creates <em>dir/foo.o</em> as the main
output, and generates auxiliary outputs in <em>dir/x-foo.*</em>, taking the
location of the primary output, and dropping the <em>.c</em> suffix from the
<em>dumpbase</em>. Dump outputs retain the suffix: <em>dir/x-foo.c.*</em>. This
option is disregarded if it does not match the suffix of a specified
<em>dumpbase</em>, except as an alternative to the executable suffix when
appending the linker output base name to <em>dumppfx</em>, as specified
below: gcc foo.c bar.c -o main.out -dumpbase-ext .out … creates
<em>main.out</em> as the primary output, and avoids overwriting the auxiliary
and dump outputs by using the executable name minus <em>auxdropsuf</em> as a
prefix, creating auxiliary outputs named <em>main-foo.*</em> and <em>main-bar.*</em>
and dump outputs named <em>main-foo.c.*</em> and <em>main-bar.c.*</em>.</dd>
<dt>
-dumpdir dumppfx
</dt>
<dd>When forming the name of an auxiliary or dump
output file, use <em>dumppfx</em> as a prefix: gcc -dumpdir pfx- -c foo.c …
creates <em>foo.o</em> as the primary output, and auxiliary outputs named
<em>pfx-foo.*</em>, combining the given <em>dumppfx</em> with the default <em>dumpbase</em>
derived from the default primary output, derived in turn from the
input name. Dump outputs also take the input name suffix:
<em>pfx-foo.c.*</em>. If <em>dumppfx</em> is to be used as a directory name, it must
end with a directory separator: gcc -dumpdir dir/ -c foo.c -o
obj/bar.o … creates <em>obj/bar.o</em> as the primary output, and auxiliary
outputs named <em>dir/bar.*</em>, combining the given <em>dumppfx</em> with the
default <em>dumpbase</em> derived from the primary output name. Dump outputs
also take the input name suffix: <em>dir/bar.c.*</em>. It defaults to the
location of the output file, unless the output file is a special file
like <code class="verbatim">/dev/null</code>. Options <strong>-save-temps=cwd</strong> and <strong>-save-temps=obj</strong>
override this default, just like an explicit <strong>-dumpdir</strong> option. In
case multiple such options are given, the last one prevails: gcc
-dumpdir pfx- -c foo.c -save-temps=obj … outputs <em>foo.o</em>, with
auxiliary outputs named <em>foo.*</em> because <strong>-save-temps=*</strong> overrides the
<em>dumppfx</em> given by the earlier <strong>-dumpdir</strong> option. It does not matter
that <strong>=obj</strong> is the default for <strong>-save-temps</strong>, nor that the output
directory is implicitly the current directory. Dump outputs are named
<em>foo.c.*</em>. When compiling from multiple input files, if <strong>-dumpbase</strong> is
specified, <em>dumpbase</em>, minus a <em>auxdropsuf</em> suffix, and a dash are
appended to (or override, if containing any directory components) an
explicit or defaulted <em>dumppfx</em>, so that each of the multiple
compilations gets differently-named aux and dump outputs. gcc foo.c
bar.c -c -dumpdir dir/pfx- -dumpbase main … outputs auxiliary dumps
to <em>dir/pfx-main-foo.*</em> and <em>dir/pfx-main-bar.*</em>, appending
<em>dumpbase</em>- to <em>dumppfx</em>. Dump outputs retain the input file suffix:
<em>dir/pfx-main-foo.c.*</em> and <em>dir/pfx-main-bar.c.*</em>, respectively.
Contrast with the single-input compilation: gcc foo.c -c -dumpdir
dir/pfx- -dumpbase main … that, applying <strong>-dumpbase</strong> to a single
source, does not compute and append a separate <em>dumpbase</em> per input
file. Its auxiliary and dump outputs go in <em>dir/pfx-main.*</em>. When
compiling and then linking from multiple input files, a defaulted or
explicitly specified <em>dumppfx</em> also undergoes the <em>dumpbase</em>-
transformation above (e.g. the compilation of <em>foo.c</em> and <em>bar.c</em>
above, but without <strong>-c</strong>). If neither <strong>-dumpdir</strong> nor <strong>-dumpbase</strong> are
given, the linker output base name, minus <em>auxdropsuf</em>, if specified,
or the executable suffix otherwise, plus a dash is appended to the
default <em>dumppfx</em> instead. Note, however, that unlike earlier cases of
linking: gcc foo.c bar.c -dumpdir dir/pfx- -o main … does not append
the output name <em>main</em> to <em>dumppfx</em>, because <strong>-dumpdir</strong> is explicitly
specified. The goal is that the explicitly-specified <em>dumppfx</em> may
contain the specified output name as part of the prefix, if desired;
only an explicitly-specified <strong>-dumpbase</strong> would be combined with it, in
order to avoid simply discarding a meaningful option. When compiling
and then linking from a single input file, the linker output base name
will only be appended to the default <em>dumppfx</em> as above if it does not
share the base name with the single input file name. This has been
covered in single-input linking cases above, but not with an explicit
<strong>-dumpdir</strong> that inhibits the combination, even if overridden by
<strong>-save-temps=*</strong>: gcc foo.c -dumpdir alt/pfx- -o dir/main.exe
-save-temps=cwd … Auxiliary outputs are named <em>foo.*</em>, and dump
outputs <em>foo.c.*</em>, in the current working directory as ultimately
requested by <strong>-save-temps=cwd</strong>. Summing it all up for an intuitive
though slightly imprecise data flow: the primary output name is broken
into a directory part and a basename part; <em>dumppfx</em> is set to the
former, unless overridden by <strong>-dumpdir</strong> or <strong>-save-temps=*</strong>, and
<em>dumpbase</em> is set to the latter, unless overriden by <strong>-dumpbase</strong>. If
there are multiple inputs or linking, this <em>dumpbase</em> may be combined
with <em>dumppfx</em> and taken from each input file. Auxiliary output names
for each input are formed by combining <em>dumppfx</em>, <em>dumpbase</em> minus
suffix, and the auxiliary output suffix; dump output names are only
different in that the suffix from <em>dumpbase</em> is retained. When it
comes to auxiliary and dump outputs created during LTO recompilation,
a combination of <em>dumppfx</em> and <em>dumpbase</em>, as given or as derived from
the linker output name but not from inputs, even in cases in which
this combination would not otherwise be used as such, is passed down
with a trailing period replacing the compiler-added dash, if any, as a
<strong>-dumpdir</strong> option to <strong>lto-wrapper</strong>; being involved in linking, this
program does not normally get any <strong>-dumpbase</strong> and <strong>-dumpbase-ext</strong>, and
it ignores them. When running sub-compilers, <strong>lto-wrapper</strong> appends LTO
stage names to the received <em>dumppfx</em>, ensures it contains a directory
component so that it overrides any <strong>-dumpdir</strong>, and passes that as
<strong>-dumpbase</strong> to sub-compilers.</dd>
<dt>

This is useful for shell scripts to capture the driver-generated

<dt>
–help

<dd>Print (on the standard output) a description of the

specified then <strong>–help</strong> is also passed on to the various processes
invoked by <strong>gcc</strong>, so that they can display the command-line options
they accept. If the <strong>-Wextra</strong> option has also been specified (prior to
the <strong>–help</strong> option), then command-line options that have no
documentation associated with them are also displayed.</dd>
<dt>
–target-help
</dt>
<dd>Print (on the standard output) a description of
target-specific command-line options for each tool. For some targets
extra target-specific information may also be printed.</dd>
<dt>
–help={class|[^]qualifier}[,…]
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Print (on the standard output) a
description of the command-line options understood by the compiler
that fit into all specified classes and qualifiers. These are the
supported classes:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
optimizers
</dt>
<dd>Display all of the optimization options supported by
the compiler.</dd>
<dt>
warnings
</dt>
<dd>Display all of the options controlling warning messages
produced by the compiler.</dd>
<dt>
target
</dt>
<dd>Display target-specific options. Unlike the
<strong>–target-help</strong> option however, target-specific options of the
linker and assembler are not displayed. This is because those tools
do not currently support the extended <strong>–help=</strong> syntax.</dd>
<dt>
params
</dt>
<dd>Display the values recognized by the <strong>–param</strong> option.</dd>
<dt>
language
</dt>
<dd>Display the options supported for <em>language</em>, where
<em>language</em> is the name of one of the languages supported in this
version of GCC. If an option is supported by all languages, one
needs to select <strong>common</strong> class.</dd>
<dt>
common
</dt>
<dd>Display the options that are common to all languages.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These are the supported qualifiers:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
undocumented
</dt>
<dd>Display only those options that are undocumented.</dd>
<dt>
joined
</dt>
<dd>Display options taking an argument that appears after an
equal sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as:
<strong>–help=target</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
separate
</dt>
<dd>Display options taking an argument that appears as a
separate word following the original option, such as: <strong>-o
output-file</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thus for example to display all the undocumented target-specific
switches supported by the compiler, use: –help=target,undocumented
The sense of a qualifier can be inverted by prefixing it with the <strong>^</strong>
character, so for example to display all binary warning options (i.e.,
ones that are either on or off and that do not take an argument) that
have a description, use: –help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented The
argument to <strong>–help=</strong> should not consist solely of inverted
qualifiers. Combining several classes is possible, although this
usually restricts the output so much that there is nothing to display.
One case where it does work, however, is when one of the classes is
<em>target</em>. For example, to display all the target-specific optimization
options, use: –help=target,optimizers The <strong>–help=</strong> option can be
repeated on the command line. Each successive use displays its
requested class of options, skipping those that have already been
displayed. If <strong>–help</strong> is also specified anywhere on the command line
then this takes precedence over any <strong>–help=</strong> option. If the <strong>-Q</strong>
option appears on the command line before the <strong>–help=</strong> option, then
the descriptive text displayed by <strong>–help=</strong> is changed. Instead of
describing the displayed options, an indication is given as to whether
the option is enabled, disabled or set to a specific value (assuming
that the compiler knows this at the point where the <strong>–help=</strong> option
is used). Here is a truncated example from the ARM port of <strong>gcc</strong>: %
gcc -Q -mabi=2 –help=target -c The following options are target
specific: -mabi= 2 -mabort-on-noreturn [disabled] -mapcs [disabled]
The output is sensitive to the effects of previous command-line
options, so for example it is possible to find out which optimizations
are enabled at <strong>-O2</strong> by using: -Q -O2 –help=optimizers Alternatively
you can discover which binary optimizations are enabled by <strong>-O3</strong> by
using: gcc -c -Q -O3 –help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O3-opts gcc -c -Q -O2
–help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O2-opts diff /tmp/O2-opts /tmp/O3-opts | grep
enabled</p>
</dd>
<dt>
–version
</dt>
<dd>Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked
GCC.</dd>
<dt>
-pass-exit-codes
</dt>
<dd>Normally the <strong>gcc</strong> program exits with the code of
1 if any phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code. If
you specify <strong>-pass-exit-codes</strong>, the <strong>gcc</strong> program instead returns with
the numerically highest error produced by any phase returning an error
indication. The C, C++, and Fortran front ends return 4 if an internal
compiler error is encountered.</dd>
<dt>
-pipe
</dt>
<dd>Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication
between the various stages of compilation. This fails to work on some
systems where the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the GNU
assembler has no trouble.</dd>
<dt>
-specs=file
</dt>
<dd>Process <em>file</em> after the compiler reads in the standard
<em>specs</em> file, in order to override the defaults which the <strong>gcc</strong> driver
program uses when determining what switches to pass to <strong>cc1</strong>,
<strong>cc1plus</strong>, <strong>as</strong>, <strong>ld</strong>, etc. More than one *-specs=*/file/ can be
specified on the command line, and they are processed in order, from
left to right.</dd>
<dt>
-wrapper
</dt>
<dd>Invoke all subcommands under a wrapper program. The name
of the wrapper program and its parameters are passed as a comma
separated list. gcc -c t.c -wrapper gdb,–args This invokes all
subprograms of <strong>gcc</strong> under <strong>gdb –args</strong>, thus the invocation of <strong>cc1</strong>
is <strong>gdb –args cc1 …</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-ffile-prefix-map=old=new
</dt>
<dd>When compiling files residing in
directory <em>old</em>, record any references to them in the result of the
compilation as if the files resided in directory <em>new</em> instead.
Specifying this option is equivalent to specifying all the individual
<strong>-f</strong>-prefix-map* options. This can be used to make reproducible builds
that are location independent. Directories referenced by directives
are not affected by these options. See also <strong>-fmacro-prefix-map</strong>,
<strong>-fdebug-prefix-map</strong>, <strong>-fprofile-prefix-map</strong> and <strong>-fcanon-prefix-map</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fcanon-prefix-map
</dt>
<dd>For the <strong>-f</strong>-prefix-map* options normally
comparison of <em>old</em> prefix against the filename that would be normally
referenced in the result of the compilation is done using textual
comparison of the prefixes, or ignoring character case for case
insensitive filesystems and considering slashes and backslashes as
equal on DOS based filesystems. The <strong>-fcanon-prefix-map</strong> causes such

Compiling C++ Programs
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes <strong>.C</strong>, <strong>.cc</strong>,
<strong>.cpp</strong>, <strong>.CPP</strong>, <strong>.c++</strong>, <strong>.cp</strong>, or <strong>.cxx</strong>; C++ header files often use
<strong>.hh</strong>, <strong>.hpp</strong>, <strong>.H</strong>, or (for shared template code) <strong>.tcc</strong>; and
preprocessed C++ files use the suffix <strong>.ii</strong>. GCC recognizes files with
these names and compiles them as C++ programs even if you call the
compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually with the name
<strong>gcc</strong>).</p>
<p>
However, the use of <strong>gcc</strong> does not add the C++ library. <strong>g++</strong> is a
program that calls GCC and automatically specifies linking against the
C++ library. It treats <strong>.c</strong>, <strong>.h</strong> and <strong>.i</strong> files as C++ source files
instead of C source files unless <strong>-x</strong> is used. This program is also
useful when precompiling a C header file with a <strong>.h</strong> extension for use
in C++ compilations. On many systems, <strong>g++</strong> is also installed with the
name <strong>c++</strong>.</p>
<p>
When you compile C++ programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for C++ programs.</p>

Options Controlling C Dialect
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++) that the compiler
accepts:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-ansi
</dt>
<dd>In C mode, this is equivalent to <strong>-std=c90</strong>. In C++ mode, it
is equivalent to <strong>-std=c++98</strong>. This turns off certain features of GCC
that are incompatible with ISO C90 (when compiling C code), or of
standard C++ (when compiling C++ code), such as the <code class="verbatim">asm</code> and <code class="verbatim">typeof</code>
keywords, and predefined macros such as <code class="verbatim">unix</code> and <code class="verbatim">vax</code> that identify
the type of system you are using. It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used ISO trigraph feature. For the C compiler, it disables
recognition of C++ style <strong>//</strong> comments as well as the <code class="verbatim">inline</code>
keyword. The alternate keywords <code class="verbatim">_ _asm_ _</code>, <code class="verbatim">_ _extension_ _</code>,
<code class="verbatim">_ _inline_ _</code> and <code class="verbatim">_ _typeof_ _</code> continue to work despite <strong>-ansi</strong>.
You would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of course, but it
is useful to put them in header files that might be included in
compilations done with <strong>-ansi</strong>. Alternate predefined macros such as
<code class="verbatim">_ _unix_ _</code> and <code class="verbatim">_ _vax_ _</code> are also available, with or without
<strong>-ansi</strong>. The <strong>-ansi</strong> option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously. For that, <strong>-Wpedantic</strong> is required in addition
to <strong>-ansi</strong>. The macro <code class="verbatim">_ _STRICT_ANSI_ _</code> is predefined when the
<strong>-ansi</strong> option is used. Some header files may notice this macro and
refrain from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros
that the ISO standard doesn&#39;t call for; this is to avoid interfering

<p>Determine the language standard. This option is currently
only supported when compiling C or C++. The compiler can accept
several base standards, such as <strong>c90</strong> or <strong>c++98</strong>, and GNU dialects of
those standards, such as <strong>gnu90</strong> or <strong>gnu++98</strong>. When a base standard is
specified, the compiler accepts all programs following that standard
plus those using GNU extensions that do not contradict it. For
example, <strong>-std=c90</strong> turns off certain features of GCC that are
incompatible with ISO C90, such as the <code class="verbatim">asm</code> and <code class="verbatim">typeof</code> keywords,
but not other GNU extensions that do not have a meaning in ISO C90,
such as omitting the middle term of a <code class="verbatim">?:</code> expression. On the other
hand, when a GNU dialect of a standard is specified, all features
supported by the compiler are enabled, even when those features change
the meaning of the base standard. As a result, some strict-conforming
programs may be rejected. The particular standard is used by
<strong>-Wpedantic</strong> to identify which features are GNU extensions given that
version of the standard. For example <strong>-std=gnu90 -Wpedantic</strong> warns
about C++ style <strong>//</strong> comments, while <strong>-std=gnu99 -Wpedantic</strong> does not.

<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Don&#39;t recognize built-in functions that do not begin with <strong>_ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">builtin</span></strong>
as prefix. GCC normally generates special code to handle certain
built-in functions more efficiently; for instance, calls to <code class="verbatim">alloca</code> may
become single instructions which adjust the stack directly, and calls to
<code class="verbatim">memcpy</code> may become inline copy loops. The resulting code is often both
smaller and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as
such, you cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the
behavior of the functions by linking with a different library. In
addition, when a function is recognized as a built-in function, GCC may
use information about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the resulting
code still contains calls to that function. For example, warnings are
given with <strong>-Wformat</strong> for bad calls to <code class="verbatim">printf</code> when <code class="verbatim">printf</code> is built
in and <code class="verbatim">strlen</code> is known not to modify global memory. With the
<strong>-fno-builtin-*/function/ option only the built-in function <em>function</em>
is disabled. <em>function</em> must not begin with *_ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">builtin</span></strong>. If a function
is named that is not built-in in this version of GCC, this option is
ignored. There is no corresponding <strong>-fbuiltin-*/function/ option; if you
wish to enable built-in functions selectively when using *-fno-builtin</strong>
or <strong>-ffreestanding</strong>, you may define macros such as: #define abs(n)
_ _builtin_abs ((n)) #define strcpy(d, s) _ _builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))</p>

<dt>
-fgnu89-inline

<dd>The option <strong>-fgnu89-inline</strong> tells GCC to use the
traditional GNU semantics for <code class="verbatim">inline</code> functions when in C99 mode.
Using this option is roughly equivalent to adding the <code class="verbatim">gnu_inline</code>
function attribute to all inline functions. The option
<strong>-fno-gnu89-inline</strong> explicitly tells GCC to use the C99 semantics for
<code class="verbatim">inline</code> when in C99 or gnu99 mode (i.e., it specifies the default
behavior). This option is not supported in <strong>-std=c90</strong> or <strong>-std=gnu90</strong>
mode. The preprocessor macros <code class="verbatim">_ _GNUC_GNU_INLINE_ _</code> and

equivalent to <strong>-fno-freestanding</strong>.</dd>

version 0. Version 0 refers to the version conforming most closely to
the C++ ABI specification. Therefore, the ABI obtained using version 0
will change in different versions of G++ as ABI bugs are fixed.
Version 1 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++
3.2. Version 2 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in
G++ 3.4, and was the default through G++ 4.9. Version 3 corrects an
error in mangling a constant address as a template argument. Version
4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a standard mangling for
vector types. Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the
mangling of attribute const/volatile on function pointer types,
decltype of a plain decl, and use of a function parameter in the
declaration of another parameter. Version 6, which first appeared in
G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion behavior of C++11 scoped enums and the
mangling of template argument packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++ and
–, and a class scope function used as a template argument. Version 7,
which first appeared in G++ 4.8, that treats nullptr_t as a builtin
type and corrects the mangling of lambdas in default argument scope.
Version 8, which first appeared in G++ 4.9, corrects the substitution
behavior of function types with function-cv-qualifiers. Version 9,
which first appeared in G++ 5.2, corrects the alignment of
<code class="verbatim">nullptr_t</code>. Version 10, which first appeared in G++ 6.1, adds
mangling of attributes that affect type identity, such as ia32 calling
convention attributes (e.g. <strong>stdcall</strong>). Version 11, which first
appeared in G++ 7, corrects the mangling of sizeof… expressions and
operator names. For multiple entities with the same name within a
function, that are declared in different scopes, the mangling now
changes starting with the twelfth occurrence. It also implies
<strong>-fnew-inheriting-ctors</strong>. Version 12, which first appeared in G++ 8,
corrects the calling conventions for empty classes on the x86_64
target and for classes with only deleted copy/move constructors. It
accidentally changes the calling convention for classes with a deleted
copy constructor and a trivial move constructor. Version 13, which
first appeared in G++ 8.2, fixes the accidental change in version 12.
Version 14, which first appeared in G++ 10, corrects the mangling of
the nullptr expression. Version 15, which first appeared in G++ 10.3,
corrects G++ 10 ABI tag regression. Version 16, which first appeared
in G++ 11, changes the mangling of <code class="verbatim">_ _alignof_ _</code> to be distinct from
that of <code class="verbatim">alignof</code>, and dependent operator names. Version 17, which
first appeared in G++ 12, fixes layout of classes that inherit from
aggregate classes with default member initializers in C++14 and up.
Version 18, which first appeard in G++ 13, fixes manglings of lambdas
that have additional context. See also <strong>-Wabi</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fabi-compat-version=n
</dt>
<dd>On targets that support strong aliases, G++
works around mangling changes by creating an alias with the correct
mangled name when defining a symbol with an incorrect mangled name.
This switch specifies which ABI version to use for the alias. With
<strong>-fabi-version=0</strong> (the default), this defaults to 13 (GCC 8.2
compatibility). If another ABI version is explicitly selected, this
defaults to 0. For compatibility with GCC versions 3.2 through 4.9,
use <strong>-fabi-compat-version=2</strong>. If this option is not provided but
<strong>-Wabi=*/n/ is, that version is used for compatibility aliases. If
this option is provided along with *-Wabi</strong> (without the version), the
version from this option is used for the warning.</dd>

<p>Enable support for <code class="verbatim">char8_t</code> as adopted for C++20. This includes the

literals, associated standard library updates, and new <code class="verbatim">_ _cpp_char8_t</code>
and <code class="verbatim">_ _cpp_lib_char8_t</code> feature test macros. This option enables
functions to be overloaded for ordinary and UTF-8 strings: int f(const
char *); <em>/ #1 int f(const char8_t *); /</em> #2 int v1 = f(&#34;text&#34;); <em>/
Calls #1 int v2 = f(u8&#34;text&#34;); /</em> Calls #2 and introduces new signatures
for user-defined literals: int operator&#34;&#34;_udl1(char8_t); int v3 =
u8x_udl1; int operator&#34;&#34;_udl2(const char8_t*, std::size_t); int v4 =
u8&#34;text&#34;_udl2; template&lt;typename T, T…&gt; int operator&#34;&#34;_udl3(); int v5
= u8&#34;text&#34;_udl3; The change to the types of UTF-8 string and character
literals introduces incompatibilities with ISO C++11 and later
standards. For example, the following code is well-formed under ISO
C++11, but is ill-formed when <strong>-fchar8_t</strong> is specified. const char <strong>cp =
u8&#34;xx&#34;;// error: invalid conversion from // `const char8_t</strong> to `const

<dd>Check that the pointer returned by <code class="verbatim">operator new</code> is

is normally unnecessary because the C++ standard specifies that
<code class="verbatim">operator new</code> only returns <code class="verbatim">0</code> if it is declared <code class="verbatim">throw()</code>, in which
case the compiler always checks the return value even without this
option. In all other cases, when <code class="verbatim">operator new</code> has a non-empty

<dt>
-fconstexpr-cache-depth=n
</dt>
<dd>Set the maximum level of nested
evaluation depth for C++11 constexpr functions that will be cached to
<em>n</em>. This is a heuristic that trades off compilation speed (when the
cache avoids repeated calculations) against memory consumption (when
the cache grows very large from highly recursive evaluations). The
default is 8. Very few users are likely to want to adjust it, but if
your code does heavy constexpr calculations you might want to
experiment to find which value works best for you.</dd>
<dt>
-fconstexpr-fp-except
</dt>
<dd>Annex F of the C standard specifies that
IEC559 floating point exceptions encountered at compile time should
not stop compilation. C++ compilers have historically not followed
this guidance, instead treating floating point division by zero as
non-constant even though it has a well defined value. This flag tells
the compiler to give Annex F priority over other rules saying that a
particular operation is undefined. constexpr float inf = 1./0.; // OK
with -fconstexpr-fp-except</dd>
<dt>
-fconstexpr-loop-limit=n

mostly for those interested in experimentation towards refining the
feature to get it into shape for a future C++ standard. On violation
of a checked contract, the violation handler is called. Users can
replace the violation handler by defining void
handle_contract_violation (const
std::experimental::contract_violation&amp;); There are different sets of
additional flags that can be used together to specify which contracts

-fno-elide-constructors
</dt>
<dd>The C++ standard allows an implementation
to omit creating a temporary that is only used to initialize another
object of the same type. Specifying this option disables that
optimization, and forces G++ to call the copy constructor in all
cases. This option also causes G++ to call trivial member functions
which otherwise would be expanded inline. In C++17, the compiler is
required to omit these temporaries, but this option still affects
trivial member functions.</dd>

<dd>Don&#39;t generate code to check for violation of
exception specifications at run time. This option violates the C++
standard, but may be useful for reducing code size in production
builds, much like defining <code class="verbatim">NDEBUG</code>. This does not give user code
permission to throw exceptions in violation of the exception
specifications; the compiler still optimizes based on the

undefined behavior at run time.</dd>

<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>The C++11 and OpenMP standards allow <code class="verbatim">thread_local</code> and <code class="verbatim">threadprivate</code>
variables to have dynamic (runtime) initialization. To support this, any
use of such a variable goes through a wrapper function that performs any
necessary initialization. When the use and definition of the variable
are in the same translation unit, this overhead can be optimized away,
but when the use is in a different translation unit there is significant
overhead even if the variable doesn&#39;t actually need dynamic
initialization. If the programmer can be sure that no use of the
variable in a non-defining TU needs to trigger dynamic initialization
(either because the variable is statically initialized, or a use of the
variable in the defining TU will be executed before any uses in another
TU), they can avoid this overhead with the <strong>-fno-extern-tls-init</strong>
option. On targets that support symbol aliases, the default is
<strong>-fextern-tls-init</strong>. On targets that do not support symbol aliases, the

overhead relative to a function with no exception specification. If
the function has local variables of types with non-trivial
destructors, the exception specification actually makes the function
smaller because the EH cleanups for those variables can be optimized
away. The semantic effect is that an exception thrown out of a

the signature of the template followed by the template arguments and
any typedefs or typenames in the signature (e.g.
<code class="verbatim">void f(T) [with T = int]</code> rather than <code class="verbatim">void f(int)</code>) so that it&#39;s
clear which template is involved. When an error message refers to a
specialization of a class template, the compiler omits any template
arguments that match the default template arguments for that template.
If either of these behaviors make it harder to understand the error
message rather than easier, you can use <strong>-fno-pretty-templates</strong> to

of the language, you can save some space by using this flag. Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but G++ generates it as
needed. The <code class="verbatim">dynamic_cast</code> operator can still be used for casts that
do not require run-time type information, i.e. casts to <code class="verbatim">void *</code> or to
unambiguous base classes. Mixing code compiled with <strong>-frtti</strong> with that
compiled with <strong>-fno-rtti</strong> may not work. For example, programs may fail

shift expressions in left-to-right order, and evaluate assignment in
right-to-left order, as adopted for C++17. Enabled by default with

ANSI/ISO C++ conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth
greater than 17 (changed to 1024 in C++11). The default value is 900,

<dd>Register destructors for objects with static
storage duration with the <code class="verbatim">_ _cxa_atexit</code> function rather than the

standards-compliant handling of static destructors, but only works if
your C library supports <code class="verbatim">_ _cxa_atexit</code>.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr

<dd>Don&#39;t use the

<code class="verbatim">std::uncaught_exception</code> to be incorrect, but is necessary if the
runtime routine is not available.</dd>
<dt>
-fvisibility-inlines-hidden
</dt>
<dd>This switch declares that the user does
not attempt to compare pointers to inline functions or methods where
the addresses of the two functions are taken in different shared
objects. The effect of this is that GCC may, effectively, mark inline
methods with <code class="verbatim">_ _attribute_ _ ((visibility (&#34;hidden&#34;)))</code> so that they
do not appear in the export table of a DSO and do not require a PLT
indirection when used within the DSO. Enabling this option can have a
dramatic effect on load and link times of a DSO as it massively
reduces the size of the dynamic export table when the library makes
heavy use of templates. The behavior of this switch is not quite the
same as marking the methods as hidden directly, because it does not
affect static variables local to the function or cause the compiler to
deduce that the function is defined in only one shared object. You may
mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the effect
of the switch for that method. For example, if you do want to compare
pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as having
default visibility. Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility has no effect. Explicitly instantiated inline methods are
unaffected by this option as their linkage might otherwise cross a
shared library boundary.</dd>
<dt>
-fvisibility-ms-compat
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This flag attempts to use visibility
settings to make GCC&#39;s C++ linkage model compatible with that of
Microsoft Visual Studio. The flag makes these changes to GCC&#39;s linkage
model:</p>
<ol>
<li>It sets the default visibility to <code class="verbatim">hidden</code>, like
<strong>-fvisibility=hidden</strong>.</li>
<li>Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.</li>
<li>The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
visibility specifications that are defined in more than one shared
object: those declarations are permitted if they are permitted when
this option is not used.</li>
</ol>
<p>In new code it is better to use <strong>-fvisibility=hidden</strong> and export those
classes that are intended to be externally visible. Unfortunately it
is possible for code to rely, perhaps accidentally, on the Visual
Studio behavior. Among the consequences of these changes are that
static data members of the same type with the same name but defined in
different shared objects are different, so changing one does not
change the other; and that pointers to function members defined in
different shared objects may not compare equal. When this flag is
given, it is a violation of the ODR to define types with the same name
differently.</p>

-fno-weak
</dt>
<dd>Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by
the linker. By default, G++ uses weak symbols if they are available.

-Wabi-tag (C++ and Objective-C++ only)

tag is used in a context that does not have that ABI tag. See <strong>C++
Attributes</strong> for more information about ABI tags.</dd>
<dt>
-Wcomma-subscript (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn about uses of a
comma expression within a subscripting expression. This usage was
deprecated in C++20 and is going to be removed in C++23. However, a
comma expression wrapped in <code class="verbatim">( )</code> is not deprecated. Example: void
f(int *a, int b, int c) { a[b,c]; <em>/ deprecated in C++20, invalid in
C++23 a[(b,c)]; /</em> OK } In C++23 it is valid to have comma separated
expressions in a subscript when an overloaded subscript operator is
found and supports the right number and types of arguments. G++ will
accept the formerly valid syntax for code that is not valid in C++23
but used to be valid but deprecated in C++20 with a pedantic warning
that can be disabled with <strong>-Wno-comma-subscript</strong>. Enabled by default
with <strong>-std=c++20</strong> unless <strong>-Wno-deprecated</strong>, and with <strong>-std=c++23</strong>
regardless of <strong>-Wno-deprecated</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wctad-maybe-unsupported (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn when
performing class template argument deduction (CTAD) on a type with no
explicitly written deduction guides. This warning will point out cases
where CTAD succeeded only because the compiler synthesized the
implicit deduction guides, which might not be what the programmer
intended. Certain style guides allow CTAD only on types that
specifically &#34;opt-in&#34;; i.e., on types that are designed to support
CTAD. This warning can be suppressed with the following pattern:
struct allow_ctad_t; <em>/ any name works template &lt;typename T&gt; struct S
{ S(T) { } }; /</em> Guide with incomplete parameter type will never be
considered. S(allow_ctad_t) -&gt; S&lt;void&gt;;</dd>
<dt>
-Wctor-dtor-privacy (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn when a class
seems unusable because all the constructors or destructors in that
class are private, and it has neither friends nor public static member
functions. Also warn if there are no non-private methods, and there&#39;s
at least one private member function that isn&#39;t a constructor or
destructor.</dd>
<dt>
-Wdangling-reference (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn when a
reference is bound to a temporary whose lifetime has ended. For
example: int n = 1; const int&amp; r = std::max(n - 1, n + 1); // r is
dangling In the example above, two temporaries are created, one for
each argument, and a reference to one of the temporaries is returned.
However, both temporaries are destroyed at the end of the full
expression, so the reference <code class="verbatim">r</code> is dangling. This warning also
detects dangling references in member initializer lists: const int&amp;
f(const int&amp; i) { return i; } struct S { const int &amp;r; // r is
dangling S() : r(f(10)) { } }; Member functions are checked as well,
but only their object argument: struct S { const S&amp; self () { return
​*this; } }; const S&amp; s = S().self(); // s is dangling Certain
functions are safe in this respect, for example <code class="verbatim">std::use_facet</code>: they
take and return a reference, but they don&#39;t return one of its
arguments, which can fool the warning. Such functions can be excluded
from the warning by wrapping them in a <code class="verbatim">#pragma</code>: #pragma GCC
diagnostic push #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored &#34;-Wdangling-reference&#34;
const T&amp; foo (const T&amp;) { … } #pragma GCC diagnostic pop
<strong>-Wdangling-reference</strong> also warns about code like auto p =
std::minmax(1, 2); where <code class="verbatim">std::minmax</code> returns
<code class="verbatim">std::pair&lt;const int&amp;, const int&amp;&gt;</code>, and both references dangle after
the end of the full expression that contains the call to
<code class="verbatim">std::minmax</code>. This warning is enabled by <strong>-Wextra</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn when
<code class="verbatim">delete</code> is used to destroy an instance of a class that has virtual
functions and non-virtual destructor. It is unsafe to delete an
instance of a derived class through a pointer to a base class if the
base class does not have a virtual destructor. This warning is enabled
by <strong>-Wall</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wdeprecated-copy (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn that the
implicit declaration of a copy constructor or copy assignment operator
is deprecated if the class has a user-provided copy constructor or
copy assignment operator, in C++11 and up. This warning is enabled by
<strong>-Wextra</strong>. With <strong>-Wdeprecated-copy-dtor</strong>, also deprecate if the class
has a user-provided destructor.</dd>

<dd>-Wno-deprecated-enum-enum-conversion (C++ and Objective-C++
only) :: Disable the warning about the case when the usual arithmetic
conversions are applied on operands where one is of enumeration type
and the other is of a different enumeration type. This conversion was
deprecated in C++20. For example: enum E1 { e }; enum E2 { f }; int k
= f - e; <strong>-Wdeprecated-enum-enum-conversion</strong> is enabled by default
with <strong>-std=c++20</strong>. In pre-C++20 dialects, this warning can be enabled
by <strong>-Wenum-conversion</strong>.</dd>
<dt>

<dd>-Wno-deprecated-enum-float-conversion (C++ and Objective-C++
only) :: Disable the warning about the case when the usual arithmetic
conversions are applied on operands where one is of enumeration type
and the other is of a floating-point type. This conversion was
deprecated in C++20. For example: enum E1 { e }; enum E2 { f }; bool b
= e &lt;= 3.7; <strong>-Wdeprecated-enum-float-conversion</strong> is enabled by default
with <strong>-std=c++20</strong>. In pre-C++20 dialects, this warning can be enabled
by <strong>-Wenum-conversion</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-init-list-lifetime (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Do not warn
about uses of <code class="verbatim">std::initializer_list</code> that are likely to result in
dangling pointers. Since the underlying array for an
<code class="verbatim">initializer_list</code> is handled like a normal C++ temporary object, it
is easy to inadvertently keep a pointer to the array past the end of
the array&#39;s lifetime. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a function returns a temporary <code class="verbatim">initializer_list</code>, or a local
<code class="verbatim">initializer_list</code> variable, the array&#39;s lifetime ends at the end of
the return statement, so the value returned has a dangling pointer.</li>
<li>If a new-expression creates an <code class="verbatim">initializer_list</code>, the array only
lives until the end of the enclosing full-expression, so the
<code class="verbatim">initializer_list</code> in the heap has a dangling pointer.</li>
<li>When an <code class="verbatim">initializer_list</code> variable is assigned from a
brace-enclosed initializer list, the temporary array created for the
right side of the assignment only lives until the end of the
full-expression, so at the next statement the <code class="verbatim">initializer_list</code>
variable has a dangling pointer. <em>/ lis initial underlying array
lives as long as li std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt; li = { 1,2,3 }; /</em>
assignment changes li to point to a temporary array li = { 4, 5 };
<em>/ now the temporary is gone and li has a dangling pointer int i =
li.begin()[0] /</em> undefined behavior</li>
<li>When a list constructor stores the <code class="verbatim">begin</code> pointer from the
<code class="verbatim">initializer_list</code> argument, this doesn&#39;t extend the lifetime of the
array, so if a class variable is constructed from a temporary
<code class="verbatim">initializer_list</code>, the pointer is left dangling by the end of the
variable declaration statement.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
-Winvalid-constexpr
</dt>
<dd>Warn when a function never produces a constant
expression. In C++20 and earlier, for every <code class="verbatim">constexpr</code> function and
function template, there must be at least one set of function
arguments in at least one instantiation such that an invocation of the
function or constructor could be an evaluated subexpression of a core
constant expression. C++23 removed this restriction, so it&#39;s possible
to have a function or a function template marked <code class="verbatim">constexpr</code> for which
no invocation satisfies the requirements of a core constant
expression. This warning is enabled as a pedantic warning by default
in C++20 and earlier. In C++23, <strong>-Winvalid-constexpr</strong> can be turned
on, in which case it will be an ordinary warning. For example: void f
(int&amp; i); constexpr void g (int&amp; i) { // Warns by default in C++20, in
C++23 only with -Winvalid-constexpr. f(i); }</dd>
<dt>
-Winvalid-imported-macros
</dt>
<dd>Verify all imported macro definitions are
valid at the end of compilation. This is not enabled by default, as it
requires additional processing to determine. It may be useful when
preparing sets of header-units to ensure consistent macros.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-literal-suffix (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Do not warn when a
string or character literal is followed by a ud-suffix which does not
begin with an underscore. As a conforming extension, GCC treats such
suffixes as separate preprocessing tokens in order to maintain
backwards compatibility with code that uses formatting macros from
<code class="verbatim">&lt;inttypes.h&gt;</code>. For example: #define _ _STDC_FORMAT_MACROS #include
&lt;inttypes.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; int main() { int64_t i64 = 123;
printf(&#34;My int64: %&#34; PRId64&#34;\n&#34;, i64); } In this case, <code class="verbatim">PRId64</code> is
treated as a separate preprocessing token. This option also controls
warnings when a user-defined literal operator is declared with a
literal suffix identifier that doesn&#39;t begin with an underscore.
Literal suffix identifiers that don&#39;t begin with an underscore are
reserved for future standardization. These warnings are enabled by
default.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-narrowing (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>For C++11 and later
standards, narrowing conversions are diagnosed by default, as required
by the standard. A narrowing conversion from a constant produces an
error, and a narrowing conversion from a non-constant produces a
warning, but <strong>-Wno-narrowing</strong> suppresses the diagnostic. Note that
this does not affect the meaning of well-formed code; narrowing
conversions are still considered ill-formed in SFINAE contexts. With
<strong>-Wnarrowing</strong> in C++98, warn when a narrowing conversion prohibited by
C++11 occurs within <strong>{ }</strong>, e.g. int i = { 2.2 }; // error: narrowing
from double to int This flag is included in <strong>-Wall</strong> and
<strong>-Wc++11-compat</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wnoexcept (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn when a
noexcept-expression evaluates to false because of a call to a function
that does not have a non-throwing exception specification (i.e.
<code class="verbatim">throw()</code> or <code class="verbatim">noexcept</code>) but is known by the compiler to never throw
an exception.</dd>
<dt>
-Wnoexcept-type (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn if the C++17
feature making <code class="verbatim">noexcept</code> part of a function type changes the mangled
name of a symbol relative to C++14. Enabled by <strong>-Wabi</strong> and
<strong>-Wc++17-compat</strong>. As an example: template &lt;class T&gt; void f(T t) { t();
}; void g() noexcept; void h() { f(g); } In C++14, <code class="verbatim">f</code> calls
<code class="verbatim">f&lt;void(*)()&gt;</code>, but in C++17 it calls <code class="verbatim">f&lt;void(*)()noexcept&gt;</code>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wclass-memaccess (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn when the
destination of a call to a raw memory function such as <code class="verbatim">memset</code> or
<code class="verbatim">memcpy</code> is an object of class type, and when writing into such an
object might bypass the class non-trivial or deleted constructor or
copy assignment, violate const-correctness or encapsulation, or
corrupt virtual table pointers. Modifying the representation of such
objects may violate invariants maintained by member functions of the
class. For example, the call to <code class="verbatim">memset</code> below is undefined because it
modifies a non-trivial class object and is, therefore, diagnosed. The
safe way to either initialize or clear the storage of objects of such
types is by using the appropriate constructor or assignment operator,
if one is available. std::string str = &#34;abc&#34;; memset (&amp;str, 0, sizeof
str); The <strong>-Wclass-memaccess</strong> option is enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong>. Explicitly
casting the pointer to the class object to <code class="verbatim">void *</code> or to a type that
can be safely accessed by the raw memory function suppresses the
warning.</dd>
<dt>
-Wnon-virtual-dtor (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn when a class
has virtual functions and an accessible non-virtual destructor itself
or in an accessible polymorphic base class, in which case it is
possible but unsafe to delete an instance of a derived class through a
pointer to the class itself or base class. This warning is
automatically enabled if <strong>-Weffc++</strong> is specified. The
<strong>-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor</strong> option (enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong>) should be
preferred because it warns about the unsafe cases without false
positives.</dd>
<dt>
-Wregister (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn on uses of the
<code class="verbatim">register</code> storage class specifier, except when it is part of the GNU
<strong>Explicit Register Variables</strong> extension. The use of the <code class="verbatim">register</code>
keyword as storage class specifier has been deprecated in C++11 and
removed in C++17. Enabled by default with <strong>-std=c++17</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wreorder (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn when the order of
member initializers given in the code does not match the order in
which they must be executed. For instance: struct A { int i; int j;
A(): j (0), i (1) { } }; The compiler rearranges the member
initializers for <code class="verbatim">i</code> and <code class="verbatim">j</code> to match the declaration order of the
members, emitting a warning to that effect. This warning is enabled by
<strong>-Wall</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-pessimizing-move (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>This warning
warns when a call to <code class="verbatim">std::move</code> prevents copy elision. A typical
scenario when copy elision can occur is when returning in a function
with a class return type, when the expression being returned is the
name of a non-volatile automatic object, and is not a function
parameter, and has the same type as the function return type. struct T
{ … }; T fn() { T t; … return std::move (t); } But in this
example, the <code class="verbatim">std::move</code> call prevents copy elision. This warning is
enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-redundant-move (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>This warning warns
about redundant calls to <code class="verbatim">std::move</code>; that is, when a move operation
would have been performed even without the <code class="verbatim">std::move</code> call. This
happens because the compiler is forced to treat the object as if it
were an rvalue in certain situations such as returning a local
variable, where copy elision isn&#39;t applicable. Consider: struct T {
… }; T fn(T t) { … return std::move (t); } Here, the <code class="verbatim">std::move</code>
call is redundant. Because G++ implements Core Issue 1579, another
example is: struct T { // convertible to U … }; struct U { … }; U
fn() { T t; … return std::move (t); } In this example, copy elision
isn&#39;t applicable because the type of the expression being returned and
the function return type differ, yet G++ treats the return value as if
it were designated by an rvalue. This warning is enabled by <strong>-Wextra</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wrange-loop-construct (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>This warning
warns when a C++ range-based for-loop is creating an unnecessary copy.
This can happen when the range declaration is not a reference, but
probably should be. For example: struct S { char arr[128]; }; void fn
() { S arr[5]; for (const auto x : arr) { … } } It does not warn
when the type being copied is a trivially-copyable type whose size is
less than 64 bytes. This warning also warns when a loop variable in a
range-based for-loop is initialized with a value of a different type
resulting in a copy. For example: void fn() { int arr[10]; for (const
double &amp;x : arr) { … } } In the example above, in every iteration of
the loop a temporary value of type <code class="verbatim">double</code> is created and destroyed,
to which the reference <code class="verbatim">const double &amp;</code> is bound. This warning is
enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wredundant-tags (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn about redundant
class-key and enum-key in references to class types and enumerated
types in contexts where the key can be eliminated without causing an
ambiguity. For example: struct foo; struct foo *p; // warn that
keyword struct can be eliminated On the other hand, in this example
there is no warning: struct foo; void foo (); <em>/ &#34;hides&#34; struct foo
void bar (struct foo&amp;); /</em> no warning, keyword struct is necessary</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-subobject-linkage (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Do not warn if
a class type has a base or a field whose type uses the anonymous
namespace or depends on a type with no linkage. If a type A depends on
a type B with no or internal linkage, defining it in multiple
translation units would be an ODR violation because the meaning of B
is different in each translation unit. If A only appears in a single
translation unit, the best way to silence the warning is to give it
internal linkage by putting it in an anonymous namespace as well. The
compiler doesn&#39;t give this warning for types defined in the main .C
file, as those are unlikely to have multiple definitions.
<strong>-Wsubobject-linkage</strong> is enabled by default.</dd>
<dt>
-Weffc++ (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Warn about violations of the
following style guidelines from Scott Meyers&#39; <em>Effective C++</em> series
of books:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a copy constructor and an assignment operator for classes
with dynamically-allocated memory.</li>
<li>Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors.</li>
<li>Have <code class="verbatim">operator=</code> return a reference to <code class="verbatim">*this</code>.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t try to return a reference when you must return an object.</li>
<li>Distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment and
decrement operators.</li>
<li>Never overload <code class="verbatim">&amp;&amp;</code>, <code class="verbatim">||</code>, or <code class="verbatim">,</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This option also enables <strong>-Wnon-virtual-dtor</strong>, which is also one of
the effective C++ recommendations. However, the check is extended to
warn about the lack of virtual destructor in accessible
non-polymorphic bases classes too. When selecting this option, be
aware that the standard library headers do not obey all of these
guidelines; use <strong>grep -v</strong> to filter out those warnings.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-exceptions (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Disable the warning
about the case when an exception handler is shadowed by another
handler, which can point out a wrong ordering of exception handlers.</dd>
<dt>
-Wstrict-null-sentinel (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn about the
use of an uncasted <code class="verbatim">NULL</code> as sentinel. When compiling only with GCC
this is a valid sentinel, as <code class="verbatim">NULL</code> is defined to <code class="verbatim">_ _null</code>. Although
it is a null pointer constant rather than a null pointer, it is
guaranteed to be of the same size as a pointer. But this use is not
portable across different compilers.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-non-template-friend (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Disable
warnings when non-template friend functions are declared within a
template. In very old versions of GCC that predate implementation of
the ISO standard, declarations such as <strong>friend int foo(int)</strong>, where
the name of the friend is an unqualified-id, could be interpreted as a
particular specialization of a template function; the warning exists
to diagnose compatibility problems, and is enabled by default.</dd>
<dt>
-Wold-style-cast (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn if an old-style
(C-style) cast to a non-void type is used within a C++ program. The
new-style casts (<code class="verbatim">dynamic_cast</code>, <code class="verbatim">static_cast</code>, <code class="verbatim">reinterpret_cast</code>,
and <code class="verbatim">const_cast</code>) are less vulnerable to unintended effects and much
easier to search for.</dd>
<dt>
-Woverloaded-virtual (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-Woverloaded-virtual=n
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a base
class. For example, in: struct A { virtual void f(); }; struct B: public
A { void f(int); // does not override }; the <code class="verbatim">A</code> class version of <code class="verbatim">f</code> is
hidden in <code class="verbatim">B</code>, and code like: B* b; b-&gt;f(); fails to compile. In cases
where the different signatures are not an accident, the simplest
solution is to add a using-declaration to the derived class to un-hide
the base function, e.g. add <code class="verbatim">using A::f;</code> to <code class="verbatim">B</code>. The optional level
suffix controls the behavior when all the declarations in the derived
class override virtual functions in the base class, even if not all of
the base functions are overridden: struct C { virtual void f(); virtual
void f(int); }; struct D: public C { void f(int); // does override }
This pattern is less likely to be a mistake; if D is only used
virtually, the user might have decided that the base class semantics for
some of the overloads are fine. At level 1, this case does not warn; at
level 2, it does. <strong>-Woverloaded-virtual</strong> by itself selects level 2.
Level 1 is included in <strong>-Wall</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-Wno-pmf-conversions (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Disable the
diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to member function to a
plain pointer.</dd>
<dt>
-Wsign-promo (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn when overload
resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or enumerated type to a
signed type, over a conversion to an unsigned type of the same size.
Previous versions of G++ tried to preserve unsignedness, but the
standard mandates the current behavior.</dd>
<dt>
-Wtemplates (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn when a primary
template declaration is encountered. Some coding rules disallow
templates, and this may be used to enforce that rule. The warning is
inactive inside a system header file, such as the STL, so one can
still use the STL. One may also instantiate or specialize templates.</dd>
<dt>
-Wmismatched-new-delete (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn for
mismatches between calls to <code class="verbatim">operator new</code> or <code class="verbatim">operator</code> delete and
the corresponding call to the allocation or deallocation function.
This includes invocations of C++ <code class="verbatim">operator delete</code> with pointers
returned from either mismatched forms of <code class="verbatim">operator new</code>, or from other
functions that allocate objects for which the <code class="verbatim">operator delete</code> isn&#39;t
a suitable deallocator, as well as calls to other deallocation
functions with pointers returned from <code class="verbatim">operator new</code> for which the
deallocation function isn&#39;t suitable. For example, the <code class="verbatim">delete</code>
expression in the function below is diagnosed because it doesn&#39;t match
the array form of the <code class="verbatim">new</code> expression the pointer argument was
returned from. Similarly, the call to <code class="verbatim">free</code> is also diagnosed. void f
() { int *a = new int[n]; delete a; <em>/ warning: mismatch in array
forms of expressions char *p = new char[n]; free (p); /</em> warning:
mismatch between new and free } The related option
<strong>-Wmismatched-dealloc</strong> diagnoses mismatches involving allocation and
deallocation functions other than <code class="verbatim">operator</code> new and
<code class="verbatim">operator delete</code>. <strong>-Wmismatched-new-delete</strong> is included in <strong>-Wall</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wmismatched-tags (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn for
declarations of structs, classes, and class templates and their
specializations with a class-key that does not match either the
definition or the first declaration if no definition is provided. For
example, the declaration of <code class="verbatim">struct Object</code> in the argument list of
<code class="verbatim">draw</code> triggers the warning. To avoid it, either remove the redundant
class-key <code class="verbatim">struct</code> or replace it with <code class="verbatim">class</code> to match its definition.
class Object { public: virtual ~Object () = 0; }; void draw (struct
Object*); It is not wrong to declare a class with the class-key
<code class="verbatim">struct</code> as the example above shows. The <strong>-Wmismatched-tags</strong> option is
intended to help achieve a consistent style of class declarations. In
code that is intended to be portable to Windows-based compilers the
warning helps prevent unresolved references due to the difference in
the mangling of symbols declared with different class-keys. The option
can be used either on its own or in conjunction with
<strong>-Wredundant-tags</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wmultiple-inheritance (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn when a
class is defined with multiple direct base classes. Some coding rules
disallow multiple inheritance, and this may be used to enforce that
rule. The warning is inactive inside a system header file, such as the
STL, so one can still use the STL. One may also define classes that
indirectly use multiple inheritance.</dd>
<dt>
-Wvirtual-inheritance
</dt>
<dd>Warn when a class is defined with a virtual
direct base class. Some coding rules disallow multiple inheritance,
and this may be used to enforce that rule. The warning is inactive
inside a system header file, such as the STL, so one can still use the
STL. One may also define classes that indirectly use virtual
inheritance.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-virtual-move-assign
</dt>
<dd>Suppress warnings about inheriting from a
virtual base with a non-trivial C++11 move assignment operator. This
is dangerous because if the virtual base is reachable along more than
one path, it is moved multiple times, which can mean both objects end
up in the moved-from state. If the move assignment operator is written
to avoid moving from a moved-from object, this warning can be
disabled.</dd>
<dt>
-Wnamespaces
</dt>
<dd>Warn when a namespace definition is opened. Some
coding rules disallow namespaces, and this may be used to enforce that
rule. The warning is inactive inside a system header file, such as the
STL, so one can still use the STL. One may also use using directives
and qualified names.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-terminate (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Disable the warning
about a throw-expression that will immediately result in a call to
<code class="verbatim">terminate</code>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-vexing-parse (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn about the most
vexing parse syntactic ambiguity. This warns about the cases when a
declaration looks like a variable definition, but the C++ language
requires it to be interpreted as a function declaration. For instance:
void f(double a) { int i(); <em>/ extern int i (void); int n(int(a)); /</em>
extern int n (int); } Another example: struct S { S(int); }; void
f(double a) { S x(int(a)); <em>/ extern struct S x (int); S y(int()); /</em>
extern struct S y (int (*) (void)); S z(); // extern struct S z
(void); } The warning will suggest options how to deal with such an
ambiguity; e.g., it can suggest removing the parentheses or using
braces instead. This warning is enabled by default.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-class-conversion (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Do not warn when
a conversion function converts an object to the same type, to a base
class of that type, or to void; such a conversion function will never
be called.</dd>
<dt>
-Wvolatile (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn about deprecated uses
of the <code class="verbatim">volatile</code> qualifier. This includes postfix and prefix <code class="verbatim">++</code> and
<code class="verbatim">--</code> expressions of <code class="verbatim">volatile</code>-qualified types, using simple
assignments where the left operand is a <code class="verbatim">volatile</code>-qualified non-class
type for their value, compound assignments where the left operand is a
<code class="verbatim">volatile</code>-qualified non-class type, <code class="verbatim">volatile</code>-qualified function
return type, <code class="verbatim">volatile</code>-qualified parameter type, and structured
bindings of a <code class="verbatim">volatile</code>-qualified type. This usage was deprecated in
C++20. Enabled by default with <strong>-std=c++20</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn
when a literal <strong>0</strong> is used as null pointer constant. This can be
useful to facilitate the conversion to <code class="verbatim">nullptr</code> in C++11.</dd>
<dt>
-Waligned-new
</dt>
<dd>Warn about a new-expression of a type that requires
greater alignment than the <code class="verbatim">alignof(std::max_align_t)</code> but uses an
allocation function without an explicit alignment parameter. This
option is enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong>. Normally this only warns about global
allocation functions, but <strong>-Waligned-new=all</strong> also warns about class
member allocation functions.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-placement-new
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-Wplacement-new=n
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Warn about placement new expressions with undefined behavior, such as
constructing an object in a buffer that is smaller than the type of the
object. For example, the placement new expression below is diagnosed
because it attempts to construct an array of 64 integers in a buffer
only 64 bytes large. char buf [64]; new (buf) int[64]; This warning is
enabled by default.</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
-Wplacement-new=1
</dt>
<dd>This is the default warning level of
<strong>-Wplacement-new</strong>. At this level the warning is not issued for some
strictly undefined constructs that GCC allows as extensions for
compatibility with legacy code. For example, the following <code class="verbatim">new</code>
expression is not diagnosed at this level even though it has undefined
behavior according to the C++ standard because it writes past the end
of the one-element array. struct S { int n, a[1]; }; S <strong>s = (S
​</strong>)malloc (sizeof *s + 31 * sizeof s-&gt;a[0]); new (s-&gt;a)int [32]();</dd>
<dt>
-Wplacement-new=2
</dt>
<dd>At this level, in addition to diagnosing all the
same constructs as at level 1, a diagnostic is also issued for
placement new expressions that construct an object in the last member
of structure whose type is an array of a single element and whose size
is less than the size of the object being constructed. While the
previous example would be diagnosed, the following construct makes use
of the flexible member array extension to avoid the warning at
level 2. struct S { int n, a[]; }; S <strong>s = (S *)malloc (sizeof *s + 32
​</strong> sizeof s-&gt;a[0]); new (s-&gt;a)int [32]();</dd>

the warning for ambiguous virtual bases is enabled by the <strong>-Wextra</strong>
option. struct A { int a; }; struct B : A { }; struct C : B, A { };</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-inherited-variadic-ctor

<dd>Suppress warnings about use of C++11
inheriting constructors when the base class inherited from has a C
variadic constructor; the warning is on by default because the
ellipsis is not inherited.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-invalid-offsetof (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Suppress
warnings from applying the <code class="verbatim">offsetof</code> macro to a non-POD type.
According to the 2014 ISO C++ standard, applying <code class="verbatim">offsetof</code> to a
non-standard-layout type is undefined. In existing C++
implementations, however, <code class="verbatim">offsetof</code> typically gives meaningful
results. This flag is for users who are aware that they are writing
nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the
warning about it. The restrictions on <code class="verbatim">offsetof</code> may be relaxed in a
future version of the C++ standard.</dd>

(void *) noexcept; void operator delete[] (void *) noexcept; without a
definition of the corresponding sized deallocation function void
operator delete (void <strong>, std::size_t) noexcept; void operator delete[]
(void *, std::size_t) noexcept; or vice versa. Enabled by *-Wextra</strong>
along with <strong>-fsized-deallocation</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wsuggest-final-types
</dt>
<dd>Warn about types with virtual methods where
code quality would be improved if the type were declared with the
C++11 <code class="verbatim">final</code> specifier, or, if possible, declared in an anonymous
namespace. This allows GCC to more aggressively devirtualize the
polymorphic calls. This warning is more effective with link-time
optimization, where the information about the class hierarchy graph is
more complete.</dd>
<dt>
-Wsuggest-final-methods
</dt>
<dd>Warn about virtual methods where code
quality would be improved if the method were declared with the C++11
<code class="verbatim">final</code> specifier, or, if possible, its type were declared in an
anonymous namespace or with the <code class="verbatim">final</code> specifier. This warning is

about the class hierarchy graph is more complete. It is recommended to
first consider suggestions of <strong>-Wsuggest-final-types</strong> and then rebuild
with new annotations.</dd>

</dl>
<p>Warn about uses of pointers to dynamically allocated objects that have

warning is enabled at all optimization levels but may yield different
results with optimization than without.</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
-Wuse-after-free=1
</dt>
<dd>At level 1 the warning attempts to diagnose only
unconditional uses of pointers made indeterminate by a deallocation
call or a successful call to <code class="verbatim">realloc</code>, regardless of whether or not
the call resulted in an actual reallocatio of memory. This includes
double-<code class="verbatim">free</code> calls as well as uses in arithmetic and relational
expressions. Although undefined, uses of indeterminate pointers in
equality (or inequality) expressions are not diagnosed at this level.</dd>
<dt>
-Wuse-after-free=2
</dt>
<dd>At level 2, in addition to unconditional uses,
the warning also diagnoses conditional uses of pointers made
indeterminate by a deallocation call. As at level 2, uses in equality
(or inequality) expressions are not diagnosed. For example, the second
call to <code class="verbatim">free</code> in the following function is diagnosed at this level:
struct A { int refcount; void *data; }; void release (struct A *p) {
int refcount = –p-&gt;refcount; free (p); if (refcount == 0) free
(p-&gt;data); // warning: p may be used after free }</dd>
<dt>
-Wuse-after-free=3
</dt>
<dd>At level 3, the warning also diagnoses uses of
indeterminate pointers in equality expressions. All uses of
indeterminate pointers are undefined but equality tests sometimes
appear after calls to <code class="verbatim">realloc</code> as an attempt to determine whether the
call resulted in relocating the object to a different address. They
are diagnosed at a separate level to aid legacy code gradually
transition to safe alternatives. For example, the equality test in the
function below is diagnosed at this level: void adjust_pointers
(int**, int); void grow (int <strong><strong>p, int n) { int **q = (int</strong></strong>)realloc
(p, n <strong>= 2); if (q == p) return; adjust_pointers ((int*</strong>)q, n); } To
avoid the warning at this level, store offsets into allocated memory
instead of pointers. This approach obviates needing to adjust the
stored pointers after reallocation.</dd>

Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialects
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-3">
<p>(NOTE: This manual does not describe the Objective-C and Objective-C++
languages themselves.</p>
<p>
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs. You can also use most of the
language-independent GNU compiler options. For example, you might
compile a file <em>some_class.m</em> like this:</p>
<p>
gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c some_class.m</p>
<p>
In this example, <strong>-fgnu-runtime</strong> is an option meant only for Objective-C
and Objective-C++ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by GCC.</p>
<p>
Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language,
Objective-C compilations may also use options specific to the C
front-end (e.g., <strong>-Wtraditional</strong>). Similarly, Objective-C++ compilations
may use C++-specific options (e.g., <strong>-Wabi</strong>).</p>
<p>
Here is a list of options that are <em>only</em> for compiling Objective-C and
Objective-C++ programs:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-fconstant-string-class=class-name
</dt>
<dd>Use <em>class-name</em> as the name of
the class to instantiate for each literal string specified with the
syntax <code class="verbatim">@&#34;...&#34;</code>. The default class name is <code class="verbatim">NXConstantString</code> if the
GNU runtime is being used, and <code class="verbatim">NSConstantString</code> if the NeXT runtime
is being used (see below). On Darwin (macOS, MacOS X) platforms, the
<strong>-fconstant-cfstrings</strong> option, if also present, overrides the
<strong>-fconstant-string-class</strong> setting and cause <code class="verbatim">@&#34;...&#34;</code> literals to be
laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings. Note that
<strong>-fconstant-cfstrings</strong> is an alias for the target-specific
<strong>-mconstant-cfstrings</strong> equivalent.</dd>
<dt>
-fgnu-runtime
</dt>
<dd>Generate object code compatible with the standard GNU
Objective-C runtime. This is the default for most types of systems.</dd>
<dt>
-fnext-runtime
</dt>
<dd>Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.
This is the default for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac
OS X. The macro <code class="verbatim">_ _NEXT_RUNTIME_ _</code> is predefined if (and only if)
this option is used.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-nil-receivers
</dt>
<dd>Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches
(<code class="verbatim">[receiver</code> message:arg]) in this translation unit ensure that the
receiver is not <code class="verbatim">nil</code>. This allows for more efficient entry points in
the runtime to be used. This option is only available in conjunction
with the NeXT runtime and ABI version 0 or 1.</dd>
<dt>
-fobjc-abi-version=n
</dt>
<dd>Use version <em>n</em> of the Objective-C ABI for the
selected runtime. This option is currently supported only for the NeXT
runtime. In that case, Version 0 is the traditional (32-bit) ABI
without support for properties and other Objective-C 2.0 additions.
Version 1 is the traditional (32-bit) ABI with support for properties
and other Objective-C 2.0 additions. Version 2 is the modern (64-bit)
ABI. If nothing is specified, the default is Version 0 on 32-bit
target machines, and Version 2 on 64-bit target machines.</dd>
<dt>
-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors
</dt>
<dd>For each Objective-C class, check if any of
its instance variables is a C++ object with a non-trivial default
constructor. If so, synthesize a special <code class="verbatim">- (id) .cxx_construct</code>
instance method which runs non-trivial default constructors on any
such instance variables, in order, and then return <code class="verbatim">self</code>. Similarly,
check if any instance variable is a C++ object with a non-trivial
destructor, and if so, synthesize a special <code class="verbatim">- (void) .cxx_destruct</code>
method which runs all such default destructors, in reverse order. The
<code class="verbatim">- (id) .cxx_construct</code> and <code class="verbatim">- (void) .cxx_destruct</code> methods thusly
generated only operate on instance variables declared in the current
Objective-C class, and not those inherited from superclasses. It is
the responsibility of the Objective-C runtime to invoke all such
methods in an object&#39;s inheritance hierarchy. The
<code class="verbatim">- (id) .cxx_construct</code> methods are invoked by the runtime immediately
after a new object instance is allocated; the <code class="verbatim">- (void) .cxx_destruct</code>
methods are invoked immediately before the runtime deallocates an
object instance. As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X
10.4 and later has support for invoking the <code class="verbatim">- (id) .cxx_construct</code>
and <code class="verbatim">- (void) .cxx_destruct</code> methods.</dd>
<dt>
-fobjc-direct-dispatch
</dt>
<dd>Allow fast jumps to the message dispatcher.
On Darwin this is accomplished via the comm page.</dd>
<dt>
-fobjc-exceptions
</dt>
<dd>Enable syntactic support for structured exception
handling in Objective-C, similar to what is offered by C++. This
option is required to use the Objective-C keywords <code class="verbatim">@try</code>, <code class="verbatim">@throw</code>,
<code class="verbatim">@catch</code>, <code class="verbatim">@finally</code> and <code class="verbatim">@synchronized</code>. This option is available
with both the GNU runtime and the NeXT runtime (but not available in
conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.2 and earlier).</dd>
<dt>
-fobjc-gc
</dt>
<dd>Enable garbage collection (GC) in Objective-C and
Objective-C++ programs. This option is only available with the NeXT
runtime; the GNU runtime has a different garbage collection
implementation that does not require special compiler flags.</dd>
<dt>
-fobjc-nilcheck
</dt>
<dd>For the NeXT runtime with version 2 of the ABI,
check for a nil receiver in method invocations before doing the actual
method call. This is the default and can be disabled using
<strong>-fno-objc-nilcheck</strong>. Class methods and super calls are never checked
for nil in this way no matter what this flag is set to. Currently this
flag does nothing when the GNU runtime, or an older version of the
NeXT runtime ABI, is used.</dd>
<dt>
-fobjc-std=objc1
</dt>
<dd>Conform to the language syntax of Objective-C 1.0,
the language recognized by GCC 4.0. This only affects the Objective-C
additions to the C/C++ language; it does not affect conformance to
C/C++ standards, which is controlled by the separate C/C++ dialect
option flags. When this option is used with the Objective-C or
Objective-C++ compiler, any Objective-C syntax that is not recognized
by GCC 4.0 is rejected. This is useful if you need to make sure that
your Objective-C code can be compiled with older versions of GCC.</dd>
<dt>
-freplace-objc-classes
</dt>
<dd>Emit a special marker instructing <strong>ld (1)</strong>
not to statically link in the resulting object file, and allow
<strong>dyld (1)</strong> to load it in at run time instead. This is used in
conjunction with the Fix-and-Continue debugging mode, where the object
file in question may be recompiled and dynamically reloaded in the
course of program execution, without the need to restart the program
itself. Currently, Fix-and-Continue functionality is only available in
conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.3 and later.</dd>
<dt>
-fzero-link
</dt>
<dd>When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler
ordinarily replaces calls to <code class="verbatim">objc_getClass(&#34;...&#34;)</code> (when the name of
the class is known at compile time) with static class references that
get initialized at load time, which improves run-time performance.
Specifying the <strong>-fzero-link</strong> flag suppresses this behavior and causes
calls to <code class="verbatim">objc_getClass(&#34;...&#34;)</code> to be retained. This is useful in
Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows for individual class
implementations to be modified during program execution. The GNU
runtime currently always retains calls to <code class="verbatim">objc_get_class(&#34;...&#34;)</code>
regardless of command-line options.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-local-ivars
</dt>
<dd>By default instance variables in Objective-C can
be accessed as if they were local variables from within the methods of
the class they&#39;re declared in. This can lead to shadowing between
instance variables and other variables declared either locally inside
a class method or globally with the same name. Specifying the
<strong>-fno-local-ivars</strong> flag disables this behavior thus avoiding variable
shadowing issues.</dd>
<dt>
-fivar-visibility=[public|protected|private|package]
</dt>
<dd>Set the
default instance variable visibility to the specified option so that
instance variables declared outside the scope of any access modifier
directives default to the specified visibility.</dd>

<dt>
-Wno-protocol (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>If a class is
declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for every method
in the protocol that is not implemented by the class. The default
behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass. If you use the <strong>-Wno-protocol</strong> option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be
implemented, and no warning is issued for them.</dd>
<dt>
-Wobjc-root-class (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn if a
class interface lacks a superclass. Most classes will inherit from
<code class="verbatim">NSObject</code> (or <code class="verbatim">Object</code>) for example. When declaring classes intended
to be root classes, the warning can be suppressed by marking their
interfaces with <code class="verbatim">_ _attribute_ _((objc_root_class))</code>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wselector (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn if multiple
methods of different types for the same selector are found during
compilation. The check is performed on the list of methods in the
final stage of compilation. Additionally, a check is performed for
each selector appearing in a <code class="verbatim">@selector(...)</code> expression, and a
corresponding method for that selector has been found during
compilation. Because these checks scan the method table only at the
end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final stage
of compilation is not reached, for example because an error is found
during compilation, or because the <strong>-fsyntax-only</strong> option is being
used.</dd>
<dt>
-Wstrict-selector-match (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn
if multiple methods with differing argument and/or return types are
found for a given selector when attempting to send a message using
this selector to a receiver of type <code class="verbatim">id</code> or <code class="verbatim">Class</code>. When this flag is
off (which is the default behavior), the compiler omits such warnings
if any differences found are confined to types that share the same
size and alignment.</dd>
<dt>
-Wundeclared-selector (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn if
a <code class="verbatim">@selector(...)</code> expression referring to an undeclared selector is
found. A selector is considered undeclared if no method with that name
has been declared before the <code class="verbatim">@selector(...)</code> expression, either
explicitly in an <code class="verbatim">@interface</code> or <code class="verbatim">@protocol</code> declaration, or
implicitly in an <code class="verbatim">@implementation</code> section. This option always
performs its checks as soon as a <code class="verbatim">@selector(...)</code> expression is found,
while <strong>-Wselector</strong> only performs its checks in the final stage of
compilation. This also enforces the coding style convention that
methods and selectors must be declared before being used.</dd>

Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of
the output device&#39;s aspect (e.g. its width, …). You can use the
options described below to control the formatting algorithm for
diagnostic messages, e.g. how many characters per line, how often source
location information should be reported. Note that some language front
ends may not honor these options.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-fmessage-length=n
</dt>
<dd>Try to format error messages so that they fit on
lines of about <em>n</em> characters. If <em>n</em> is zero, then no line-wrapping
is done; each error message appears on a single line. This is the
default for all front ends. Note - this option also affects the
display of the <strong>#error</strong> and <strong>#warning</strong> pre-processor directives, and
the <strong>deprecated</strong> function/type/variable attribute. It does not however
affect the <strong>pragma GCC warning</strong> and <strong>pragma GCC error</strong> pragmas.</dd>
<dt>
-fdiagnostics-plain-output
</dt>
<dd>This option requests that diagnostic
output look as plain as possible, which may be useful when running
<strong>dejagnu</strong> or other utilities that need to parse diagnostics output and
prefer that it remain more stable over time.
<strong>-fdiagnostics-plain-output</strong> is currently equivalent to the following
options: <strong>-fno-diagnostics-show-caret</strong>
-fno-diagnostics-show-line-numbers -fdiagnostics-color=never
-fdiagnostics-urls=never -fdiagnostics-path-format=separate-events In
the future, if GCC changes the default appearance of its diagnostics,
the corresponding option to disable the new behavior will be added to
this list.</dd>
<dt>
-fdiagnostics-show-location=once
</dt>
<dd>Only meaningful in line-wrapping
mode. Instructs the diagnostic messages reporter to emit source
location information <em>once</em>; that is, in case the message is too long
to fit on a single physical line and has to be wrapped, the source
location won&#39;t be emitted (as prefix) again, over and over, in
subsequent continuation lines. This is the default behavior.</dd>
<dt>
-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line
</dt>
<dd>Only meaningful in
line-wrapping mode. Instructs the diagnostic messages reporter to emit
the same source location information (as prefix) for physical lines
that result from the process of breaking a message which is too long
to fit on a single line.</dd>
<dt>
-fdiagnostics-color[=WHEN]
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-fno-diagnostics-color
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Use color in diagnostics. <em>WHEN</em> is <strong>never</strong>, <strong>always</strong>, or <strong>auto</strong>. The
default depends on how the compiler has been configured, it can be any
of the above <em>WHEN</em> options or also <strong>never</strong> if <strong>GCC_COLORS</strong> environment
variable isn&#39;t present in the environment, and <strong>auto</strong> otherwise. <strong>auto</strong>
makes GCC use color only when the standard error is a terminal, and when
not executing in an emacs shell. The forms <strong>-fdiagnostics-color</strong> and
<strong>-fno-diagnostics-color</strong> are aliases for <strong>-fdiagnostics-color=always</strong>
and <strong>-fdiagnostics-color=never</strong>, respectively. The colors are defined by
the environment variable <strong>GCC_COLORS</strong>. Its value is a colon-separated
list of capabilities and Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) substrings. SGR
commands are interpreted by the terminal or terminal emulator. (See the
section in the documentation of your text terminal for permitted values
and their meanings as character attributes.) These substring values are
integers in decimal representation and can be concatenated with
semicolons. Common values to concatenate include <strong>1</strong> for bold, <strong>4</strong> for
underline, <strong>5</strong> for blink, <strong>7</strong> for inverse, <strong>39</strong> for default foreground
color, <strong>30</strong> to <strong>37</strong> for foreground colors, <strong>90</strong> to <strong>97</strong> for 16-color
mode foreground colors, <strong>38;5;0</strong> to <strong>38;5;255</strong> for 88-color and
256-color modes foreground colors, <strong>49</strong> for default background color,
<strong>40</strong> to <strong>47</strong> for background colors, <strong>100</strong> to <strong>107</strong> for 16-color mode
background colors, and <strong>48;5;0</strong> to <strong>48;5;255</strong> for 88-color and 256-color
modes background colors. The default <strong>GCC_COLORS</strong> is
error=01;31:warning=01;35:note=01;36:range1=32:range2=34:locus=01:\
quote=01:path=01;36:fixit-insert=32:fixit-delete=31:\
diff-filename=01:diff-hunk=32:diff-delete=31:diff-insert=32:\
type-diff=01;32:fnname=01;32:targs=35 where <strong>01;31</strong> is bold red, <strong>01;35</strong>
is bold magenta, <strong>01;36</strong> is bold cyan, <strong>32</strong> is green, <strong>34</strong> is blue, <strong>01</strong>
is bold, and <strong>31</strong> is red. Setting <strong>GCC_COLORS</strong> to the empty string
disables colors. Supported capabilities are as follows.</p>

<dl>
<dt>
-fdiagnostics-urls[=WHEN]
</dt>
<dd>Use escape sequences to embed URLs in
diagnostics. For example, when <strong>-fdiagnostics-show-option</strong> emits text
showing the command-line option controlling a diagnostic, embed a URL
for documentation of that option. <em>WHEN</em> is <strong>never</strong>, <strong>always</strong>, or
<strong>auto</strong>. <strong>auto</strong> makes GCC use URL escape sequences only when the
standard error is a terminal, and when not executing in an emacs shell
or any graphical terminal which is known to be incompatible with this
feature, see below. The default depends on how the compiler has been
configured. It can be any of the above <em>WHEN</em> options. GCC can also be
configured (via the <strong>–with-diagnostics-urls=auto-if-env</strong>
configure-time option) so that the default is affected by environment
variables. Under such a configuration, GCC defaults to using <strong>auto</strong> if
either <strong>GCC_URLS</strong> or <strong>TERM_URLS</strong> environment variables are present and
non-empty in the environment of the compiler, or <strong>never</strong> if neither
are. However, even with <strong>-fdiagnostics-urls=always</strong> the behavior is
dependent on those environment variables: If <strong>GCC_URLS</strong> is set to
empty or <strong>no</strong>, do not embed URLs in diagnostics. If set to <strong>st</strong>, URLs
use ST escape sequences. If set to <strong>bel</strong>, the default, URLs use BEL
escape sequences. Any other non-empty value enables the feature. If
<strong>GCC_URLS</strong> is not set, use <strong>TERM_URLS</strong> as a fallback. Note: ST is an
ANSI escape sequence, string terminator <strong>ESC \</strong>, BEL is an ASCII
character, CTRL-G that usually sounds like a beep. At this time GCC
tries to detect also a few terminals that are known to not implement
the URL feature, and have bugs or at least had bugs in some versions
that are still in use, where the URL escapes are likely to misbehave,
i.e. print garbage on the screen. That list is currently
xfce4-terminal, certain known to be buggy gnome-terminal versions, the
linux console, and mingw. This check can be skipped with the
<strong>-fdiagnostics-urls=always</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-diagnostics-show-option
</dt>
<dd>By default, each diagnostic emitted
includes text indicating the command-line option that directly
controls the diagnostic (if such an option is known to the diagnostic
machinery). Specifying the <strong>-fno-diagnostics-show-option</strong> flag
suppresses that behavior.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-diagnostics-show-caret
</dt>
<dd>By default, each diagnostic emitted
includes the original source line and a caret <strong>^</strong> indicating the
column. This option suppresses this information. The source line is
truncated to <em>n</em> characters, if the <strong>-fmessage-length=n</strong> option is
given. When the output is done to the terminal, the width is limited
to the width given by the <strong>COLUMNS</strong> environment variable or, if not
set, to the terminal width.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-diagnostics-show-labels
</dt>
<dd>By default, when printing source code
(via <strong>-fdiagnostics-show-caret</strong>), diagnostics can label ranges of
source code with pertinent information, such as the types of
expressions: printf (&#34;foo %s bar&#34;, long_i + long_j); <code>^
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</code> | | char * long int This option suppresses the
printing of these labels (in the example above, the vertical bars and
the &#34;char *&#34; and &#34;long int&#34; text).</dd>
<dt>
-fno-diagnostics-show-cwe
</dt>
<dd>Diagnostic messages can optionally have
an associated CWE (<code class="verbatim">https://cwe.mitre.org/index.html</code>) identifier. GCC
itself only provides such metadata for some of the <strong>-fanalyzer</strong>
diagnostics. GCC plugins may also provide diagnostics with such
metadata. By default, if this information is present, it will be
printed with the diagnostic. This option suppresses the printing of
this metadata.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-diagnostics-show-rules
</dt>
<dd>Diagnostic messages can optionally have
rules associated with them, such as from a coding standard, or a
specification. GCC itself does not do this for any of its diagnostics,
but plugins may do so. By default, if this information is present, it
will be printed with the diagnostic. This option suppresses the
printing of this metadata.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-diagnostics-show-line-numbers
</dt>
<dd>By default, when printing source
code (via <strong>-fdiagnostics-show-caret</strong>), a left margin is printed,
showing line numbers. This option suppresses this left margin.</dd>
<dt>
-fdiagnostics-minimum-margin-width=width
</dt>
<dd>This option controls the
minimum width of the left margin printed by
<strong>-fdiagnostics-show-line-numbers</strong>. It defaults to 6.</dd>
<dt>
-fdiagnostics-parseable-fixits
</dt>
<dd>Emit fix-it hints in a
machine-parseable format, suitable for consumption by IDEs. For each
fix-it, a line will be printed after the relevant diagnostic, starting
with the string &#34;fix-it:&#34;. For example:
fix-it:&#34;test.c&#34;:{45:3-45:21}:&#34;gtk_widget_show_all&#34; The location is
expressed as a half-open range, expressed as a count of bytes,
starting at byte 1 for the initial column. In the above example, bytes
3 through 20 of line 45 of &#34;test.c&#34; are to be replaced with the given
string: 00000000011111111112222222222 12345678901234567890123456789
gtk_widget_showall (dlg); ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ gtk_widget_show_all The
filename and replacement string escape backslash as &#34;\\&#34;, tab as &#34;\t&#34;,
newline as &#34;\n&#34;, double quotes as &#34;\&#34;&#34;, non-printable characters as
octal (e.g. vertical tab as &#34;\013&#34;). An empty replacement string
indicates that the given range is to be removed. An empty range (e.g.
&#34;45:3-45:3&#34;) indicates that the string is to be inserted at the given
position.</dd>
<dt>
-fdiagnostics-generate-patch
</dt>
<dd>Print fix-it hints to stderr in
unified diff format, after any diagnostics are printed. For example:
— test.c <del>+</del> test.c @ -42,5 +42,5 @ void show_cb(GtkDialog *dlg) { -
gtk_widget_showall(dlg); + gtk_widget_show_all(dlg); } The diff may or
may not be colorized, following the same rules as for diagnostics (see
<strong>-fdiagnostics-color</strong>).</dd>
<dt>
-fdiagnostics-show-template-tree
</dt>
<dd>In the C++ frontend, when printing
diagnostics showing mismatching template types, such as: could not
convert std::map&lt;int, std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt;() from
map&lt;[…],vector&lt;double&gt;&gt; to map&lt;[…],vector&lt;float&gt;&gt; the
<strong>-fdiagnostics-show-template-tree</strong> flag enables printing a tree-like
structure showing the common and differing parts of the types, such
as: map&lt; […], vector&lt; [double != float]&gt;&gt; The parts that differ are
highlighted with color (&#34;double&#34; and &#34;float&#34; in this case).</dd>
<dt>
-fno-elide-type
</dt>
<dd>By default when the C++ frontend prints diagnostics
showing mismatching template types, common parts of the types are
printed as &#34;[…]&#34; to simplify the error message. For example: could
not convert std::map&lt;int, std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt;() from
map&lt;[…],vector&lt;double&gt;&gt; to map&lt;[…],vector&lt;float&gt;&gt; Specifying the
<strong>-fno-elide-type</strong> flag suppresses that behavior. This flag also
affects the output of the <strong>-fdiagnostics-show-template-tree</strong> flag.</dd>
<dt>
-fdiagnostics-path-format=KIND
</dt>
<dd>Specify how to print paths of
control-flow events for diagnostics that have such a path associated
with them. <em>KIND</em> is <strong>none</strong>, <strong>separate-events</strong>, or <strong>inline-events</strong>,
the default. <strong>none</strong> means to not print diagnostic paths.
<strong>separate-events</strong> means to print a separate &#34;note&#34; diagnostic for each
event within the diagnostic. For example: test.c:29:5: error: passing
NULL as argument 1 to PyList_Append which requires a non-NULL
parameter test.c:25:10: note: (1) when PyList_New fails, returning
NULL test.c:27:3: note: (2) when i &lt; count test.c:29:5: note: (3) when
calling PyList_Append, passing NULL from (1) as argument 1
<strong>inline-events</strong> means to print the events &#34;inline&#34; within the source
code. This view attempts to consolidate the events into runs of
sufficiently-close events, printing them as labelled ranges within the
source. For example, the same events as above might be printed as:
test: events 1-3 | | 25 | list = PyList_New(0); | | ^~~~~~~~~~~~~ | |
​| | | (1) when PyList_New fails, returning NULL | 26 | | 27 | for (i =
0; i &lt; count; i++) { | | <code>~</code> | | | | | (2) when i &lt; count | 28 | item
= PyLong_FromLong(random()); | 29 | PyList_Append(list, item); | |
<code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</code> | | | | | (3) when calling PyList_Append,
passing NULL from (1) as argument 1 | Interprocedural control flow is
shown by grouping the events by stack frame, and using indentation to
show how stack frames are nested, pushed, and popped. For example:
test: events 1-2 | | 133 | { | | ^ | | | | | (1) entering test | 134 |
boxed_int *obj = make_boxed_int (i); | | <code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</code> | | | | |
(2) calling make_boxed_int | +–&gt; make_boxed_int: events 3-4 | | 120 |
{ | | ^ | | | | | (3) entering make_boxed_int | 121 | boxed_int
​*result = (boxed_int *)wrapped_malloc (sizeof (boxed_int)); | |
<code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</code> | | | | | (4) calling
wrapped_malloc | +–&gt; wrapped_malloc: events 5-6 | | 7 | { | | ^ | | |
​| | (5) entering wrapped_malloc | 8 | return malloc (size); | |
<code>~~~~~~~~~~~</code> | | | | | (6) calling malloc | &lt;————-+ | test:
event 7 | | 138 | free_boxed_int (obj); | | ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ | | |
​| | (7) calling free_boxed_int | (etc)</dd>
<dt>
-fdiagnostics-show-path-depths
</dt>
<dd>This option provides additional
information when printing control-flow paths associated with a
diagnostic. If this is option is provided then the stack depth will be
printed for each run of events within
<strong>-fdiagnostics-path-format=inline-events</strong>. If provided with
<strong>-fdiagnostics-path-format=separate-events</strong>, then the stack depth and
function declaration will be appended when printing each event. This
is intended for use by GCC developers and plugin developers when
debugging diagnostics that report interprocedural control flow.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-show-column
</dt>
<dd>Do not print column numbers in diagnostics. This
may be necessary if diagnostics are being scanned by a program that
does not understand the column numbers, such as <strong>dejagnu</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fdiagnostics-column-unit=UNIT
</dt>
<dd>Select the units for the column
number. This affects traditional diagnostics (in the absence of
<strong>-fno-show-column</strong>), as well as JSON format diagnostics if requested.
The default <em>UNIT</em>, <strong>display</strong>, considers the number of display columns
occupied by each character. This may be larger than the number of
bytes required to encode the character, in the case of tab characters,
or it may be smaller, in the case of multibyte characters. For
example, the character &#34;GREEK SMALL LETTER PI (U+03C0)&#34; occupies one
display column, and its UTF-8 encoding requires two bytes; the
character &#34;SLIGHTLY SMILING FACE (U+1F642)&#34; occupies two display
columns, and its UTF-8 encoding requires four bytes. Setting <em>UNIT</em> to
<strong>byte</strong> changes the column number to the raw byte count in all cases,
as was traditionally output by GCC prior to version 11.1.0.</dd>
<dt>
-fdiagnostics-column-origin=ORIGIN
</dt>
<dd>Select the origin for column
numbers, i.e. the column number assigned to the first column. The
default value of 1 corresponds to traditional GCC behavior and to the
GNU style guide. Some utilities may perform better with an origin of
0; any non-negative value may be specified.</dd>
<dt>
-fdiagnostics-escape-format=FORMAT
</dt>
<dd>When GCC prints pertinent source
lines for a diagnostic it normally attempts to print the source bytes
directly. However, some diagnostics relate to encoding issues in the
source file, such as malformed UTF-8, or issues with Unicode
normalization. These diagnostics are flagged so that GCC will escape
bytes that are not printable ASCII when printing their pertinent
source lines. This option controls how such bytes should be escaped.
The default <em>FORMAT</em>, <strong>unicode</strong> displays Unicode characters that are
not printable ASCII in the form <strong>&lt;U+XXXX&gt;</strong>, and bytes that do not
correspond to a Unicode character validly-encoded in UTF-8-encoded
will be displayed as hexadecimal in the form <strong>&lt;XX&gt;</strong>. For example, a
source line containing the string <strong>before</strong> followed by the Unicode
character U+03C0 (&#34;GREEK SMALL LETTER PI&#34;, with UTF-8 encoding 0xCF
0x80) followed by the byte 0xBF (a stray UTF-8 trailing byte),
followed by the string <strong>after</strong> will be printed for such a diagnostic
as: before&lt;U+03C0&gt;&lt;BF&gt;after Setting <em>FORMAT</em> to <strong>bytes</strong> will display
all non-printable-ASCII bytes in the form <strong>&lt;XX&gt;</strong>, thus showing the
underlying encoding of non-ASCII Unicode characters. For the example
above, the following will be printed: before&lt;CF&gt;&lt;80&gt;&lt;BF&gt;after</dd>
<dt>
-fdiagnostics-format=FORMAT
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Select a different format for printing
diagnostics. <em>FORMAT</em> is <strong>text</strong>, <strong>sarif-stderr</strong>, <strong>sarif-file</strong>, <strong>json</strong>,
<strong>json-stderr</strong>, or <strong>json-file</strong>. The default is <strong>text</strong>. The
<strong>sarif-stderr</strong> and <strong>sarif-file</strong> formats both emit diagnostics in SARIF
Version 2.1.0 format, either to stderr, or to a file named
<em>source.sarif</em>, respectively. The <strong>json</strong> format is a synonym for
<strong>json-stderr</strong>. The <strong>json-stderr</strong> and <strong>json-file</strong> formats are
identical, apart from where the JSON is emitted to - with the former,
the JSON is emitted to stderr, whereas with <strong>json-file</strong> it is written
to <em>source.gcc.json</em>. The emitted JSON consists of a top-level JSON
array containing JSON objects representing the diagnostics. The JSON
is emitted as one line, without formatting; the examples below have
been formatted for clarity. Diagnostics can have child diagnostics.
For example, this error and note: misleading-indentation.c:15:3:
warning: this if clause does not guard… [-Wmisleading-indentation]
15 | if (flag) | ^~ misleading-indentation.c:17:5: note: …this
statement, but the latter is misleadingly indented as if it were
guarded by the if 17 | y = 2; | ^ might be printed in JSON form (after
formatting) like this: [ { &#34;kind&#34;: &#34;warning&#34;, &#34;locations&#34;: [ {

child of the <code class="verbatim">warning</code>. A diagnostic has a <code class="verbatim">kind</code>. If this is
<code class="verbatim">warning</code>, then there is an <code class="verbatim">option</code> key describing the command-line
option controlling the warning. A diagnostic can contain zero or more
locations. Each location has an optional <code class="verbatim">label</code> string and up to
three positions within it: a <code class="verbatim">caret</code> position and optional <code class="verbatim">start</code> and
<code class="verbatim">finish</code> positions. A position is described by a <code class="verbatim">file</code> name, a <code class="verbatim">line</code>
number, and three numbers indicating a column position:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="verbatim">display-column</code> counts display columns, accounting for tabs and
multibyte characters.</li>
<li><code class="verbatim">byte-column</code> counts raw bytes.</li>
<li><code class="verbatim">column</code> is equal to one of the previous two, as dictated by the
<strong>-fdiagnostics-column-unit</strong> option.</li>
</ul>
<p>All three columns are relative to the origin specified by
<strong>-fdiagnostics-column-origin</strong>, which is typically equal to 1 but may
be set, for instance, to 0 for compatibility with other utilities that
number columns from 0. The column origin is recorded in the JSON
output in the <code class="verbatim">column-origin</code> tag. In the remaining examples below,
the extra column number outputs have been omitted for brevity. For
example, this error: bad-binary-ops.c:64:23: error: invalid operands

example, this diagnostic with a replacement fix-it hint: demo.c:8:15:
error: struct s has no member named colour; did you mean color? 8 |
return ptr-&gt;colour; | ^~~~~~ | color might be printed in JSON form as:
{ &#34;children&#34;: [], &#34;fixits&#34;: [ { &#34;next&#34;: { &#34;column&#34;: 21, &#34;file&#34;:

false, &#34;message&#34;: &#34;\u2018struct s\u2019 has no member named …&#34; }
where the fix-it hint suggests replacing the text from <code class="verbatim">start</code> up to
but not including <code class="verbatim">next</code> with <code class="verbatim">string</code>&#39;s value. Deletions are
expressed via an empty value for <code class="verbatim">string</code>, insertions by having
<code class="verbatim">start</code> equal <code class="verbatim">next</code>. If the diagnostic has a path of control-flow
events associated with it, it has a <code class="verbatim">path</code> array of objects
representing the events. Each event object has a <code class="verbatim">description</code> string,
a <code class="verbatim">location</code> object, along with a <code class="verbatim">function</code> string and a <code class="verbatim">depth</code>
number for representing interprocedural paths. The <code class="verbatim">function</code>
represents the current function at that event, and the <code class="verbatim">depth</code>
represents the stack depth relative to some baseline: the higher, the
more frames are within the stack. For example, the intraprocedural
example shown for <strong>-fdiagnostics-path-format=</strong> might have this JSON
for its path: &#34;path&#34;: [ { &#34;depth&#34;: 0, &#34;description&#34;: &#34;when PyList_New
fails, returning NULL&#34;, &#34;function&#34;: &#34;test&#34;, &#34;location&#34;: { &#34;column&#34;:

Options to Request or Suppress Warnings
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that are not
inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there may have been
an error.</p>
<p>
The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by GCC.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-fsyntax-only
</dt>
<dd>Check the code for syntax errors, but don&#39;t do
anything beyond that.</dd>
<dt>
-fmax-errors=n
</dt>
<dd>Limits the maximum number of error messages to <em>n</em>,
at which point GCC bails out rather than attempting to continue
processing the source code. If <em>n</em> is 0 (the default), there is no
limit on the number of error messages produced. If <strong>-Wfatal-errors</strong> is
also specified, then <strong>-Wfatal-errors</strong> takes precedence over this
option.</dd>
<dt>
-w
</dt>
<dd>Inhibit all warning messages.</dd>
<dt>
-Werror
</dt>
<dd>Make all warnings into errors.</dd>
<dt>
-Werror=
</dt>
<dd>Make the specified warning into an error. The specifier
for a warning is appended; for example <strong>-Werror=switch</strong> turns the
warnings controlled by <strong>-Wswitch</strong> into errors. This switch takes a
negative form, to be used to negate <strong>-Werror</strong> for specific warnings;
for example <strong>-Wno-error=switch</strong> makes <strong>-Wswitch</strong> warnings not be
errors, even when <strong>-Werror</strong> is in effect. The warning message for each
controllable warning includes the option that controls the warning.
That option can then be used with <strong>-Werror=</strong> and <strong>-Wno-error=</strong> as
described above. (Printing of the option in the warning message can be
disabled using the <strong>-fno-diagnostics-show-option</strong> flag.) Note that
specifying *-Werror=*/foo/ automatically implies *-W*/foo/. However,
*-Wno-error=*/foo/ does not imply anything.</dd>
<dt>
-Wfatal-errors
</dt>
<dd>This option causes the compiler to abort compilation
on the first error occurred rather than trying to keep going and
printing further error messages.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with <strong>-W</strong>,
for example <strong>-Wimplicit</strong> to request warnings on implicit declarations.
Each of these specific warning options also has a negative form
beginning <strong>-Wno-</strong> to turn off warnings; for example, <strong>-Wno-implicit</strong>.
This manual lists only one of the two forms, whichever is not the
default. For further language-specific options also refer to <strong>C++
Dialect Options</strong> and <strong>Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options</strong>.
Additional warnings can be produced by enabling the static analyzer;</p>
<p>
Some options, such as <strong>-Wall</strong> and <strong>-Wextra</strong>, turn on other options, such
as <strong>-Wunused</strong>, which may turn on further options, such as
<strong>-Wunused-value</strong>. The combined effect of positive and negative forms is
that more specific options have priority over less specific ones,
independently of their position in the command-line. For options of the
same specificity, the last one takes effect. Options enabled or disabled
via pragmas take effect as if they appeared at the end of the
command-line.</p>
<p>
When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
<strong>-Wunknown-warning</strong>), GCC emits a diagnostic stating that the option is
not recognized. However, if the <strong>-Wno-</strong> form is used, the behavior is
slightly different: no diagnostic is produced for <strong>-Wno-unknown-warning</strong>
unless other diagnostics are being produced. This allows the use of new
<strong>-Wno-</strong> options with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the
compiler warns that an unrecognized option is present.</p>
<p>
The effectiveness of some warnings depends on optimizations also being
enabled. For example <strong>-Wsuggest-final-types</strong> is more effective with
link-time optimization and some instances of other warnings may not be
issued at all unless optimization is enabled. While optimization in
general improves the efficacy of control and data flow sensitive
warnings, in some cases it may also cause false positives.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-Wpedantic
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-pedantic
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++; reject all
programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other programs that do
not follow ISO C and ISO C++. For ISO C, follows the version of the ISO
C standard specified by any <strong>-std</strong> option used. Valid ISO C and ISO C++
programs should compile properly with or without this option (though a
rare few require <strong>-ansi</strong> or a <strong>-std</strong> option specifying the required
version of ISO C). However, without this option, certain GNU extensions
and traditional C and C++ features are supported as well. With this
option, they are rejected. <strong>-Wpedantic</strong> does not cause warning messages
for use of the alternate keywords whose names begin and end with <strong>_ _</strong>.
This alternate format can also be used to disable warnings for non-ISO
<strong>_ _intN</strong> types, i.e. <strong>_ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intN</span> _</strong>. Pedantic warnings are also disabled
in the expression that follows <code class="verbatim">_ _extension_ _</code>. However, only system
header files should use these escape routes; application programs should
avoid them. Some users try to use <strong>-Wpedantic</strong> to check programs for
strict ISO C conformance. They soon find that it does not do quite what
they want: it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all—only those for
which ISO C <em>requires</em> a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added. A feature to report any failure to conform
to ISO C might be useful in some instances, but would require
considerable additional work and would be quite different from
<strong>-Wpedantic</strong>. We don&#39;t have plans to support such a feature in the near
future. Where the standard specified with <strong>-std</strong> represents a GNU
extended dialect of C, such as <strong>gnu90</strong> or <strong>gnu99</strong>, there is a
corresponding <em>base standard</em>, the version of ISO C on which the GNU
extended dialect is based. Warnings from <strong>-Wpedantic</strong> are given where
they are required by the base standard. (It does not make sense for such
warnings to be given only for features not in the specified GNU C
dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all features
the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be nothing
to warn about.)</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-pedantic-errors
</dt>
<dd>Give an error whenever the <em>base standard</em> (see
<strong>-Wpedantic</strong>) requires a diagnostic, in some cases where there is
undefined behavior at compile-time and in some other cases that do not
prevent compilation of programs that are valid according to the
standard. This is not equivalent to <strong>-Werror=pedantic</strong>, since there
are errors enabled by this option and not enabled by the latter and
vice versa.</dd>
<dt>
-Wall
</dt>
<dd>This enables all the warnings about constructions that some
users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to
prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros. This also
enables some language-specific warnings described in <strong>C++ Dialect</strong>
Options and <strong>Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options</strong>. <strong>-Wall</strong>
turns on the following warning flags: <strong>-Waddress</strong> -Warray-bounds=1

Note that some warning flags are not implied by <strong>-Wall</strong>. Some of them
warn about constructions that users generally do not consider
questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check for;
others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid in
some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to suppress
the warning. Some of them are enabled by <strong>-Wextra</strong> but many of them
must be enabled individually.</dd>
<dt>
-Wextra

<dd>
<p>This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled
by <strong>-Wall</strong>. (This option used to be called <strong>-W</strong>. The older name is
still supported, but the newer name is more descriptive.)
<strong>-Wclobbered</strong> -Wcast-function-type -Wdangling-reference (C++ only)

following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pointer is compared against integer zero with <code class="verbatim">&lt;</code>, <code class="verbatim">&lt;=</code>, <code class="verbatim">&gt;</code>, or

</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
-Wabi (C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Warn about code
affected by ABI changes. This includes code that may not be compatible
with the vendor-neutral C++ ABI as well as the psABI for the
particular target. Since G++ now defaults to updating the ABI with
each major release, normally <strong>-Wabi</strong> warns only about C++ ABI
compatibility problems if there is a check added later in a release
series for an ABI issue discovered since the initial release. <strong>-Wabi</strong>
warns about more things if an older ABI version is selected (with
<strong>-fabi-version=*/n/). *-Wabi</strong> can also be used with an explicit
version number to warn about C++ ABI compatibility with a particular
<strong>-fabi-version</strong> level, e.g. <strong>-Wabi=2</strong> to warn about changes relative
to <strong>-fabi-version=2</strong>. If an explicit version number is provided and
<strong>-fabi-compat-version</strong> is not specified, the version number from this
option is used for compatibility aliases. If no explicit version
number is provided with this option, but <strong>-fabi-compat-version</strong> is
specified, that version number is used for C++ ABI warnings. Although
an effort has been made to warn about all such cases, there are
probably some cases that are not warned about, even though G++ is
generating incompatible code. There may also be cases where warnings
are emitted even though the code that is generated is compatible. You
should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are concerned
about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary compatible
with code generated by other compilers. Known incompatibilities in
<strong>-fabi-version=2</strong> (which was the default from GCC 3.4 to 4.9) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A template with a non-type template parameter of reference type was
mangled incorrectly: extern int N; template &lt;int &amp;&gt; struct S {};
void n (S&lt;N&gt;) {2} This was fixed in <strong>-fabi-version=3</strong>.</li>
<li>SIMD vector types declared using <code class="verbatim">_ _attribute ((vector_size))</code> were
mangled in a non-standard way that does not allow for overloading of
functions taking vectors of different sizes. The mangling was
changed in <strong>-fabi-version=4</strong>.</li>
<li><code class="verbatim">_ _attribute ((const))</code> and <code class="verbatim">noreturn</code> were mangled as type
qualifiers, and <code class="verbatim">decltype</code> of a plain declaration was folded away.
These mangling issues were fixed in <strong>-fabi-version=5</strong>.</li>
<li>Scoped enumerators passed as arguments to a variadic function are
promoted like unscoped enumerators, causing <code class="verbatim">va_arg</code> to complain. On
most targets this does not actually affect the parameter passing
ABI, as there is no way to pass an argument smaller than <code class="verbatim">int</code>.
Also, the ABI changed the mangling of template argument packs,
<code class="verbatim">const_cast</code>, <code class="verbatim">static_cast</code>, prefix increment/decrement, and a class
scope function used as a template argument. These issues were
corrected in <strong>-fabi-version=6</strong>.</li>
<li>Lambdas in default argument scope were mangled incorrectly, and the
ABI changed the mangling of <code class="verbatim">nullptr_t</code>. These issues were corrected
in <strong>-fabi-version=7</strong>.</li>
<li>When mangling a function type with function-cv-qualifiers, the
un-qualified function type was incorrectly treated as a substitution
candidate. This was fixed in <strong>-fabi-version=8</strong>, the default for GCC
5.1.</li>
<li><code class="verbatim">decltype(nullptr)</code> incorrectly had an alignment of 1, leading to
unaligned accesses. Note that this did not affect the ABI of a
function with a <code class="verbatim">nullptr_t</code> parameter, as parameters have a minimum
alignment. This was fixed in <strong>-fabi-version=9</strong>, the default for GCC
5.2.</li>
<li>Target-specific attributes that affect the identity of a type, such
as ia32 calling conventions on a function type (stdcall, regparm,
etc.), did not affect the mangled name, leading to name collisions
when function pointers were used as template arguments. This was
fixed in <strong>-fabi-version=10</strong>, the default for GCC 6.1.</li>
</ul>
<p>This option also enables warnings about psABI-related changes. The
known psABI changes at this point include:</p>
<ul>
<li>For SysV/x86-64, unions with <code class="verbatim">long double</code> members are passed in
memory as specified in psABI. Prior to GCC 4.4, this was not the
case. For example: union U { long double ld; int i; }; <code class="verbatim">union U</code> is
now always passed in memory.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-changes-meaning (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>C++ requires that
unqualified uses of a name within a class have the same meaning in the

ill-formed: struct A; struct B1 { A a; typedef A A; }; <em>/ warning, A
changes meaning struct B2 { A a; struct A { }; }; /</em> error, A changes
meaning By default, the B1 case is only a warning because the two
declarations have the same type, while the B2 case is an error. Both
diagnostics can be disabled with <strong>-Wno-changes-meaning</strong>. Alternately,
the error case can be reduced to a warning with
<strong>-Wno-error=changes-meaning</strong> or <strong>-fpermissive</strong>. Both diagnostics are
also suppressed by <strong>-fms-extensions</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wchar-subscripts
</dt>
<dd>Warn if an array subscript has type <code class="verbatim">char</code>. This
is a common cause of error, as programmers often forget that this type
is signed on some machines. This warning is enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-coverage-mismatch
</dt>
<dd>Warn if feedback profiles do not match when
using the <strong>-fprofile-use</strong> option. If a source file is changed between
compiling with <strong>-fprofile-generate</strong> and with <strong>-fprofile-use</strong>, the
files with the profile feedback can fail to match the source file and
GCC cannot use the profile feedback information. By default, this
warning is enabled and is treated as an error.
<strong>-Wno-coverage-mismatch</strong> can be used to disable the warning or
<strong>-Wno-error=coverage-mismatch</strong> can be used to disable the error.
Disabling the error for this warning can result in poorly optimized
code and is useful only in the case of very minor changes such as bug
fixes to an existing code-base. Completely disabling the warning is
not recommended.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-coverage-invalid-line-number
</dt>
<dd>Warn in case a function ends
earlier than it begins due to an invalid linenum macros. The warning
is emitted only with <strong>–coverage</strong> enabled. By default, this warning is
enabled and is treated as an error.
<strong>-Wno-coverage-invalid-line-number</strong> can be used to disable the warning
or <strong>-Wno-error=coverage-invalid-line-number</strong> can be used to disable
the error.</dd>

floating-point unit implement <code class="verbatim">float</code> in hardware, but emulate
<code class="verbatim">double</code> in software. On such a machine, doing computations using
<code class="verbatim">double</code> values is much more expensive because of the overhead
required for software emulation. It is easy to accidentally do
computations with <code class="verbatim">double</code> because floating-point literals are
implicitly of type <code class="verbatim">double</code>. For example, in: float area(float radius)

attributes, in the <code class="verbatim">printf</code>, <code class="verbatim">scanf</code>, <code class="verbatim">strftime</code> and <code class="verbatim">strfmon</code> (an
X/Open extension, not in the C standard) families (or other

checked against the format features supported by GNU libc version 2.2.
These include all ISO C90 and C99 features, as well as features from the
Single Unix Specification and some BSD and GNU extensions. Other library
implementations may not support all these features; GCC does not support
warning about features that go beyond a particular library&#39;s
limitations. However, if <strong>-Wpedantic</strong> is used with <strong>-Wformat</strong>, warnings
are given about format features not in the selected standard version

<p>Level <em>1</em> of <strong>-Wformat-overflow</strong> enabled by <strong>-Wformat</strong> employs a
conservative approach that warns only about calls that most likely
overflow the buffer. At this level, numeric arguments to format
directives with unknown values are assumed to have the value of one, and
strings of unknown length to be empty. Numeric arguments that are known
to be bounded to a subrange of their type, or string arguments whose
output is bounded either by their directive&#39;s precision or by a finite
set of string literals, are assumed to take on the value within the
range that results in the most bytes on output. For example, the call to
<code class="verbatim">sprintf</code> below is diagnosed because even with both <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> equal to
zero, the terminating NUL character (<code class="verbatim">\0</code>) appended by the function to
the destination buffer will be written past its end. Increasing the size
of the buffer by a single byte is sufficient to avoid the warning,
though it may not be sufficient to avoid the overflow. void f (int a,
int b) { char buf [13]; sprintf (buf, &#34;a = %i, b = %i\n&#34;, a, b); }</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-Wformat-overflow=2
</dt>
<dd>Level <em>2</em> warns also about calls that might
overflow the destination buffer given an argument of sufficient length
or magnitude. At level <em>2</em>, unknown numeric arguments are assumed to
have the minimum representable value for signed types with a precision
greater than 1, and the maximum representable value otherwise. Unknown
string arguments whose length cannot be assumed to be bounded either
by the directive&#39;s precision, or by a finite set of string literals
they may evaluate to, or the character array they may point to, are
assumed to be 1 character long. At level <em>2</em>, the call in the example
above is again diagnosed, but this time because with <em>a</em> equal to a
32-bit <code class="verbatim">INT_MIN</code> the first <code class="verbatim">%i</code> directive will write some of its
digits beyond the end of the destination buffer. To make the call safe
regardless of the values of the two variables, the size of the
destination buffer must be increased to at least 34 bytes. GCC
includes the minimum size of the buffer in an informational note
following the warning. An alternative to increasing the size of the
destination buffer is to constrain the range of formatted values. The
maximum length of string arguments can be bounded by specifying the
precision in the format directive. When numeric arguments of format
directives can be assumed to be bounded by less than the precision of
their type, choosing an appropriate length modifier to the format
specifier will reduce the required buffer size. For example, if <em>a</em>
and <em>b</em> in the example above can be assumed to be within the precision
of the <code class="verbatim">short int</code> type then using either the <code class="verbatim">%hi</code> format directive
or casting the argument to <code class="verbatim">short</code> reduces the maximum required size
of the buffer to 24 bytes. void f (int a, int b) { char buf [23];
sprintf (buf, &#34;a = %hi, b = %i\n&#34;, a, (short)b); }</dd>

<strong>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=</strong> also takes into account control flow

guarded statement that does not use braces, followed by an unguarded
statement with the same indentation. In the following example, the

&#34;if&#34; conditional. if (some_condition ()) foo (); bar (); <em>* Gotcha:
this is not guarded by the &#34;if&#34;. *</em> In the case of mixed tabs and
spaces, the warning uses the <strong>-ftabstop=</strong> option to determine if the
statements line up (defaulting to 8). The warning is not issued for
code involving multiline preprocessor logic such as the following
example. if (flagA) foo (0); #if SOME_CONDITION_THAT_DOES_NOT_HOLD if
(flagB) #endif foo (1); The warning is not issued after a <code class="verbatim">#line</code>
directive, since this typically indicates autogenerated code, and no
assumptions can be made about the layout of the file that the
directive references. This warning is enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong> in C and C++.</dd>
<dt>
-Wmissing-attributes
</dt>
<dd>Warn when a declaration of a function is
missing one or more attributes that a related function is declared
with and whose absence may adversely affect the correctness or
efficiency of generated code. For example, the warning is issued for
declarations of aliases that use attributes to specify less
restrictive requirements than those of their targets. This typically
represents a potential optimization opportunity. By contrast, the
<strong>-Wattribute-alias=2</strong> option controls warnings issued when the alias
is more restrictive than the target, which could lead to incorrect
code generation. Attributes considered include <code class="verbatim">alloc_align</code>,
<code class="verbatim">alloc_size</code>, <code class="verbatim">cold</code>, <code class="verbatim">const</code>, <code class="verbatim">hot</code>, <code class="verbatim">leaf</code>, <code class="verbatim">malloc</code>, <code class="verbatim">nonnull</code>,
<code class="verbatim">noreturn</code>, <code class="verbatim">nothrow</code>, <code class="verbatim">pure</code>, <code class="verbatim">returns_nonnull</code>, and <code class="verbatim">returns_twice</code>.
In C++, the warning is issued when an explicit specialization of a
primary template declared with attribute <code class="verbatim">alloc_align</code>, <code class="verbatim">alloc_size</code>,
<code class="verbatim">assume_aligned</code>, <code class="verbatim">format</code>, <code class="verbatim">format_arg</code>, <code class="verbatim">malloc</code>, or <code class="verbatim">nonnull</code> is
declared without it. Attributes <code class="verbatim">deprecated</code>, <code class="verbatim">error</code>, and <code class="verbatim">warning</code>
suppress the warning.. You can use the <code class="verbatim">copy</code> attribute to apply the
same set of attributes to a declaration as that on another declaration
without explicitly enumerating the attributes. This attribute can be
applied to declarations of functions, variables, or types.
<strong>-Wmissing-attributes</strong> is enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong>. For example, since the
declaration of the primary function template below makes use of both
attribute <code class="verbatim">malloc</code> and <code class="verbatim">alloc_size</code> the declaration of the explicit
specialization of the template is diagnosed because it is missing one
of the attributes. template &lt;class T&gt; T* _ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">attribute</span> _ ((malloc,
alloc_size (1))) allocate (size_t); template &lt;&gt; void* _ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">attribute</span> _

-Wno-missing-profile

<dd>This option controls warnings if feedback
profiles are missing when using the <strong>-fprofile-use</strong> option. This
option diagnoses those cases where a new function or a new file is
added between compiling with <strong>-fprofile-generate</strong> and with
<strong>-fprofile-use</strong>, without regenerating the profiles. In these cases,
the profile feedback data files do not contain any profile feedback
information for the newly added function or file respectively. Also,
in the case when profile count data (.gcda) files are removed, GCC
cannot use any profile feedback information. In all these cases,
warnings are issued to inform you that a profile generation step is
due. Ignoring the warning can result in poorly optimized code.
<strong>-Wno-missing-profile</strong> can be used to disable the warning, but this is
not recommended and should be done only when non-existent profile data
is justified.</dd>
<dt>
-Wmismatched-dealloc

<dd>Warn for calls to deallocation functions with
pointer arguments returned from from allocations functions for which
the former isn&#39;t a suitable deallocator. A pair of functions can be

<code class="verbatim">malloc</code>. Unless disabled by the <strong>-fno-builtin</strong> option the standard
functions <code class="verbatim">calloc</code>, <code class="verbatim">malloc</code>, <code class="verbatim">realloc</code>, and <code class="verbatim">free</code>, as well as the
corresponding forms of C++ <code class="verbatim">operator new</code> and <code class="verbatim">operator delete</code> are
implicitly associated as matching allocators and deallocators. In the
following example <code class="verbatim">mydealloc</code> is the deallocator for pointers returned
from <code class="verbatim">myalloc</code>. void mydealloc (void*); _ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">attribute</span> _ ((malloc
(mydealloc, 1))) void* myalloc (size_t); void f (void) { void *p =
myalloc (32); <em>/ …use p… free (p); /</em> warning: not a matching
deallocator for myalloc mydealloc (p); // ok } In C++, the related
option <strong>-Wmismatched-new-delete</strong> diagnoses mismatches involving either
<code class="verbatim">operator new</code> or <code class="verbatim">operator delete</code>. Option <strong>-Wmismatched-dealloc</strong> is
included in <strong>-Wall</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wmultistatement-macros

<dd>Warn about unsafe multiple statement macros
that appear to be guarded by a clause such as <code class="verbatim">if</code>, <code class="verbatim">else</code>, <code class="verbatim">for</code>,
<code class="verbatim">switch</code>, or <code class="verbatim">while</code>, in which only the first statement is actually
guarded after the macro is expanded. For example: #define DOIT x++;
y++ if (c) DOIT; will increment <code class="verbatim">y</code> unconditionally, not just when <code class="verbatim">c</code>
holds. The can usually be fixed by wrapping the macro in a do-while
loop: #define DOIT do { x++; y++; } while (0) if (c) DOIT; This
warning is enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong> in C and C++.</dd>
<dt>
-Wparentheses
</dt>
<dd>Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts,
such as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about. Also warn if a comparison like <code class="verbatim">x&lt;=y&lt;=z</code>
appears; this is equivalent to <code class="verbatim">(x&lt;=y ? 1 : 0) &lt;</code> z=, which is a
different interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.
Also warn for dangerous uses of the GNU extension to <code class="verbatim">?:</code> with omitted
middle operand. When the condition in the <code class="verbatim">?</code>: operator is a boolean
expression, the omitted value is always 1. Often programmers expect it
to be a value computed inside the conditional expression instead. For
C++ this also warns for some cases of unnecessary parentheses in
declarations, which can indicate an attempt at a function call instead
of a declaration: { <em>/ Declares a local variable called mymutex.
std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; (mymutex); /</em> User meant
std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock (mymutex); } This warning is enabled

-Wno-self-move (C++ and Objective-C++ only)

<dd>This warning warns when
a value is moved to itself with <code class="verbatim">std::move</code>. Such a <code class="verbatim">std::move</code>
typically has no effect. struct T { … }; void fn() { T t; … t =
std::move (t); } This warning is enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wsequence-point
</dt>
<dd>Warn about code that may have undefined semantics
because of violations of sequence point rules in the C and C++
standards. The C and C++ standards define the order in which
expressions in a C/C++ program are evaluated in terms of <em>sequence
points</em>, which represent a partial ordering between the execution of
parts of the program: those executed before the sequence point, and
those executed after it. These occur after the evaluation of a full
expression (one which is not part of a larger expression), after the
evaluation of the first operand of a <code class="verbatim">&amp;&amp;</code>, <code class="verbatim">||</code>, <code class="verbatim">? :</code> or <code class="verbatim">,</code> (comma)
operator, before a function is called (but after the evaluation of its
arguments and the expression denoting the called function), and in
certain other places. Other than as expressed by the sequence point
rules, the order of evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is
not specified. All these rules describe only a partial order rather
than a total order, since, for example, if two functions are called
within one expression with no sequence point between them, the order
in which the functions are called is not specified. However, the
standards committee have ruled that function calls do not overlap. It
is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect. Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and C++ standards specify that &#34;Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.&#34;. If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable. Examples of code
with undefined behavior are <code class="verbatim">a = a++;</code>, <code class="verbatim">a[n]</code> = b[n++] and
<code class="verbatim">a[i++] = i;</code>. Some more complicated cases are not diagnosed by this
option, and it may give an occasional false positive result, but in
general it has been found fairly effective at detecting this sort of
problem in programs. The C++17 standard will define the order of
evaluation of operands in more cases: in particular it requires that
the right-hand side of an assignment be evaluated before the left-hand
side, so the above examples are no longer undefined. But this option
will still warn about them, to help people avoid writing code that is
undefined in C and earlier revisions of C++. The standard is worded
confusingly, therefore there is some debate over the precise meaning
of the sequence point rules in subtle cases. Links to discussions of
the problem, including proposed formal definitions, may be found on
the GCC readings page, at &lt;*<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html*">https://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html*</a>&gt;. This
warning is enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong> for C and C++.</dd>

<dd>Warn whenever a function is defined with a return
type that defaults to <code class="verbatim">int</code>. Also warn about any <code class="verbatim">return</code> statement

without a value). For C only, warn about a <code class="verbatim">return</code> statement with an

C++, a reference) to an uninitialized object to a <code class="verbatim">const</code>-qualified
argument of a built-in function known to read the object is also
diagnosed by this warning. (<strong>-Wmaybe-uninitialized</strong> is issued for
ordinary functions.) If you want to warn about code that uses the
uninitialized value of the variable in its own initializer, use the
<strong>-Winit-self</strong> option. These warnings occur for individual
uninitialized elements of structure, union or array variables as well
as for variables that are uninitialized as a whole. They do not occur
for variables or elements declared <code class="verbatim">volatile</code>. Because these warnings
depend on optimization, the exact variables or elements for which
there are warnings depend on the precise optimization options and
version of GCC used. Note that there may be no warning about a
variable that is used only to compute a value that itself is never
used, because such computations may be deleted by data flow analysis
before the warnings are printed. In C++, this warning also warns about
using uninitialized objects in member-initializer-lists. For example,

<dd>For an object with automatic or allocated
storage duration, if there exists a path from the function entry to a
use of the object that is initialized, but there exist some other
paths for which the object is not initialized, the compiler emits a
warning if it cannot prove the uninitialized paths are not executed at
run time. In addition, passing a pointer (or in C++, a reference) to
an uninitialized object to a <code class="verbatim">const</code>-qualified function argument is
also diagnosed by this warning. (<strong>-Wuninitialized</strong> is issued for
built-in functions known to read the object.) Annotating the function
with attribute <code class="verbatim">access (none)</code> indicates that the argument isn&#39;t used
to access the object and avoids the warning. These warnings are only
possible in optimizing compilation, because otherwise GCC does not
keep track of the state of variables. These warnings are made optional
because GCC may not be able to determine when the code is correct in
spite of appearing to have an error. Here is one example of how this
can happen: { int x; switch (y) { case 1: x = 1; break; case 2: x = 4;
break; case 3: x = 5; } foo (x); } If the value of <code class="verbatim">y</code> is always 1, 2
or 3, then <code class="verbatim">x</code> is always initialized, but GCC doesn&#39;t know this. To
suppress the warning, you need to provide a default case with
<strong>assert</strong> (0) or similar code. This option also warns when a
non-volatile automatic variable might be changed by a call to
<code class="verbatim">longjmp</code>. The compiler sees only the calls to <code class="verbatim">setjmp</code>. It cannot
know where <code class="verbatim">longjmp</code> will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code. As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because <code class="verbatim">longjmp</code> cannot in fact
be called at the place that would cause a problem. Some spurious
warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions you use that
never return as <code class="verbatim">noreturn</code>. This warning is enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong> or

<dd>This option is only active when

Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false positives).
Higher levels also correspond to more effort, similar to the way <strong>-O</strong>
works. <strong>-Wstrict-aliasing</strong> is equivalent to <strong>-Wstrict-aliasing=3</strong>.
Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate. Possibly useful when
higher levels do not warn but <strong>-fstrict-aliasing</strong> still breaks the
code, as it has very few false negatives. However, it has many false
positives. Warns for all pointer conversions between possibly
incompatible types, even if never dereferenced. Runs in the front end
only. Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise. May still have many
false positives (not as many as level 1 though), and few false
negatives (but possibly more than level 1). Unlike level 1, it only
warns when an address is taken. Warns about incomplete types. Runs in
the front end only. Level 3 (default for <strong>-Wstrict-aliasing</strong>): Should
have very few false positives and few false negatives. Slightly slower
than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled. Takes care of the
common pun+dereference pattern in the front end: <code class="verbatim">*(int*)&amp;some_float</code>.
If optimization is enabled, it also runs in the back end, where it
deals with multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive points-to
information. Only warns when the converted pointer is dereferenced.

<p>This option is only active when signed overflow is undefined. It warns
about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the assumption that
signed overflow does not occur. Note that it does not warn about all
cases where the code might overflow: it only warns about cases where the
compiler implements some optimization. Thus this warning depends on the
optimization level. An optimization that assumes that signed overflow
does not occur is perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved
are such that overflow never does, in fact, occur. Therefore this
warning can easily give a false positive: a warning about code that is
not actually a problem. To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined. No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
requires, in particular when determining whether a loop will be executed
at all.</p>

example, the call to <code class="verbatim">strncpy</code> specifies the size of the destination

<p>Warn about function pointers that might be candidates for <code class="verbatim">format</code>

these are only possible candidates. GCC guesses that <code class="verbatim">format</code>
attributes might be appropriate for any function that calls a function
like <code class="verbatim">vprintf</code> or <code class="verbatim">vscanf</code>, but this might not always be the case, and

<dt>
-Walloca-larger-than=byte-size
</dt>
<dd>This option warns on calls to
<code class="verbatim">alloca</code> with an integer argument whose value is either zero, or that
is not bounded by a controlling predicate that limits its value to at
most <em>byte-size</em>. It also warns for calls to <code class="verbatim">alloca</code> where the bound
value is unknown. Arguments of non-integer types are considered
unbounded even if they appear to be constrained to the expected range.
For example, a bounded case of <code class="verbatim">alloca</code> could be: void func (size_t n)
{ void *p; if (n &lt;= 1000) p = alloca (n); else p = malloc (n); f (p);
} In the above example, passing <code class="verbatim">-Walloca-larger-than=1000</code> would not
issue a warning because the call to <code class="verbatim">alloca</code> is known to be at most
1000 bytes. However, if <code class="verbatim">-Walloca-larger-than=500</code> were passed, the
compiler would emit a warning. Unbounded uses, on the other hand, are
uses of <code class="verbatim">alloca</code> with no controlling predicate constraining its
integer argument. For example: void func () { void *p = alloca (n); f
(p); } If <code class="verbatim">-Walloca-larger-than=500</code> were passed, the above would
trigger a warning, but this time because of the lack of bounds
checking. Note, that even seemingly correct code involving signed
integers could cause a warning: void func (signed int n) { if (n
&lt; 500) { p = alloca (n); f (p); } } In the above example, <em>n</em> could be
negative, causing a larger than expected argument to be implicitly
cast into the <code class="verbatim">alloca</code> call. This option also warns when <code class="verbatim">alloca</code> is
used in a loop. <strong>-Walloca-larger-than=PTRDIFF_MAX</strong> is enabled by

the bound specified in the array is assumed to be the minimum number of
elements expected to be provided in calls to the function and the
maximum number of elements accessed by it. Failing to provide arguments
of sufficient size or accessing more than the maximum number of elements
may be diagnosed by warnings such as <strong>-Warray-bounds</strong>. At level 1 the
warning diagnoses inconsistencies involving array parameters declared
using the <code class="verbatim">T[static N]</code> form. For example, the warning triggers for the
following redeclarations because the first one allows an array of any
size to be passed to <code class="verbatim">f</code> while the second one with the keyword <code class="verbatim">static</code>
specifies that the array argument must have at least four elements. void
f (int[static 4]); void f (int[]); <em>/ warning (inconsistent array form)
void g (void) { int *p = (int *)malloc (4); f (p); /</em> warning (array too

considered equivalent and do not trigger a warning. void g (int*); void
g (int[]); <em>/ no warning void g (int[8]); /</em> warning (inconsistent array

This may be dangerous; for instance, it may seem that a piece of code

warning supported by GCC. The default is <strong>-Wbidi-chars=unpaired</strong>,
which warns about improperly terminated bidi contexts.
<strong>-Wbidi-chars=none</strong> turns the warning off. <strong>-Wbidi-chars=any</strong> warns

by <strong>-Wall</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wtrampolines
</dt>
<dd>Warn about trampolines generated for pointers to
nested functions. A trampoline is a small piece of data or code that
is created at run time on the stack when the address of a nested
function is taken, and is used to call the nested function indirectly.
For some targets, it is made up of data only and thus requires no
special treatment. But, for most targets, it is made up of code and
thus requires the stack to be made executable in order for the program
to work properly.</dd>
<dt>
-Wfloat-equal
</dt>
<dd>Warn if floating-point values are used in equality
comparisons. The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient
(for the programmer) to consider floating-point values as
approximations to infinitely precise real numbers. If you are doing
this, then you need to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some
other way) the maximum or likely maximum error that the computation
introduces, and allow for it when performing comparisons (and when
producing output, but that&#39;s a different problem). In particular,
instead of testing for equality, you should check to see whether the
two values have ranges that overlap; and this is done with the
relational operators, so equality comparisons are probably mistaken.</dd>
<dt>
-Wtraditional (C and Objective-C only)

<p>Warn about certain
constructs that behave differently in traditional and ISO C. Also warn
about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C equivalent, and/or
problematic constructs that should be avoided.</p>
<ul>
<li>Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro
body. In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string
literals, but in ISO C it does not.</li>
<li>In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
Traditional preprocessors only considered a line to be a directive
if the <strong>#</strong> appeared in column 1 on the line. Therefore
<strong>-Wtraditional</strong> warns about directives that traditional C
understands but ignores because the <strong>#</strong> does not appear as the first
character on the line. It also suggests you hide directives like
<code class="verbatim">#pragma</code> not understood by traditional C by indenting them. Some
traditional implementations do not recognize <code class="verbatim">#elif</code>, so this option
suggests avoiding it altogether.</li>
<li>A function-like macro that appears without arguments.</li>
<li>The unary plus operator.</li>
<li>The <strong>U</strong> integer constant suffix, or the <strong>F</strong> or <strong>L</strong> floating-point
constant suffixes. (Traditional C does support the <strong>L</strong> suffix on
integer constants.) Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in
the system headers of most modern systems, e.g. the <strong>_MIN*/*_MAX</strong>
macros in <code class="verbatim">&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>. Use of these macros in user code might
normally lead to spurious warnings, however GCC&#39;s integrated
preprocessor has enough context to avoid warning in these cases.</li>
<li>A function declared external in one block and then used after the
end of the block.</li>
<li>A <code class="verbatim">switch</code> statement has an operand of type <code class="verbatim">long</code>.</li>
<li>A non-<code class="verbatim">static</code> function declaration follows a <code class="verbatim">static</code> one. This
construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.</li>
<li>The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type. This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten. I.e. hexadecimal or octal values,
which typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.</li>
<li>Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.</li>
<li>Initialization of automatic aggregates.</li>
<li>Identifier conflicts with labels. Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.</li>
<li>Initialization of unions. If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted. This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer
in user code appears conditioned on e.g. <code class="verbatim">_ _STDC_ _</code> to avoid
missing initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to
zero in the traditional C case.</li>
<li>Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating-point values and
vice versa. The absence of these prototypes when compiling with
traditional C causes serious problems. This is a subset of the
possible conversion warnings; for the full set use
<strong>-Wtraditional-conversion</strong>.</li>
<li>Use of ISO C style function definitions. This warning intentionally
is <em>not</em> issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these ISO C features appear in your code when using
libiberty&#39;s traditional C compatibility macros, <code class="verbatim">PARAMS</code> and
<code class="verbatim">VPARAMS</code>. This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a GCC extension and thus not
relevant to traditional C compatibility.</li>
</ul>

<dt>
-Wtraditional-conversion (C and Objective-C only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn if a
prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what would
happen to the same argument in the absence of a prototype. This

conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed-point argument
except when the same as the default promotion.</dd>
<dt>
-Wdeclaration-after-statement (C and Objective-C only)
</dt>

-Wshadow
</dt>
<dd>Warn whenever a local variable or type declaration shadows
another variable, parameter, type, class member (in C++), or instance
variable (in Objective-C) or whenever a built-in function is shadowed.
Note that in C++, the compiler warns if a local variable shadows an
explicit typedef, but not if it shadows a struct/class/enum. If this
warning is enabled, it includes also all instances of local shadowing.
This means that <strong>-Wno-shadow=local</strong> and <strong>-Wno-shadow=compatible-local</strong>
are ignored when <strong>-Wshadow</strong> is used. Same as <strong>-Wshadow=global</strong>.</dd>

variable or parameter.</dd>
<dt>
-Wshadow=compatible-local
</dt>
<dd>Warn when a local variable shadows
another local variable or parameter whose type is compatible with that
of the shadowing variable. In C++, type compatibility here means the
type of the shadowing variable can be converted to that of the
shadowed variable. The creation of this flag (in addition to
<strong>-Wshadow=local</strong>) is based on the idea that when a local variable
shadows another one of incompatible type, it is most likely
intentional, not a bug or typo, as shown in the following example: for
(SomeIterator i = SomeObj.begin(); i != SomeObj.end(); ++i) { for (int
i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i) { … } … } Since the two variable <code class="verbatim">i</code> in the
example above have incompatible types, enabling only
<strong>-Wshadow=compatible-local</strong> does not emit a warning. Because their
types are incompatible, if a programmer accidentally uses one in place
of the other, type checking is expected to catch that and emit an
error or warning. Use of this flag instead of <strong>-Wshadow=local</strong> can
possibly reduce the number of warnings triggered by intentional
shadowing. Note that this also means that shadowing <code class="verbatim">const char *i</code> by
<code class="verbatim">char *i</code> does not emit a warning. This warning is also enabled by
<strong>-Wshadow=local</strong>.</dd>

-Wpointer-arith
</dt>
<dd>Warn about anything that depends on the &#34;size of&#34; a
function type or of <code class="verbatim">void</code>. GNU C assigns these types a size of 1, for
convenience in calculations with <code class="verbatim">void *</code> pointers and pointers to

<dt>
-Wno-pointer-compare
</dt>
<dd>Do not warn if a pointer is compared with a
zero character constant. This usually means that the pointer was meant
to be dereferenced. For example: const char *p = foo (); if (p == \0)
return 42; Note that the code above is invalid in C++11. This warning
is enabled by default.</dd>

<dd>Warn if a comparison is always true or always false
due to the limited range of the data type, but do not warn for
constant expressions. For example, warn if an unsigned variable is

<dt>
-Wabsolute-value (C and Objective-C only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn for calls to
standard functions that compute the absolute value of an argument when
a more appropriate standard function is available. For example,
calling <code class="verbatim">abs(3.14)</code> triggers the warning because the appropriate
function to call to compute the absolute value of a double argument is

warning is also enabled by <strong>-Wpedantic</strong> and <strong>-Wextra</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wunused-macros
</dt>
<dd>Warn about macros defined in the main file that are
unused. A macro is <em>used</em> if it is expanded or tested for existence at
least once. The preprocessor also warns if the macro has not been used
at the time it is redefined or undefined. Built-in macros, macros
defined on the command line, and macros defined in include files are
not warned about. <em>Note:</em> If a macro is actually used, but only used
in skipped conditional blocks, then the preprocessor reports it as
unused. To avoid the warning in such a case, you might improve the
scope of the macro&#39;s definition by, for example, moving it into the
first skipped block. Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with
something like: #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning #endif</dd>

-Wcast-qual
</dt>
<dd>Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type
qualifier from the target type. For example, warn if a <code class="verbatim">const char *</code>
is cast to an ordinary <code class="verbatim">char *</code>. Also warn when making a cast that
introduces a type qualifier in an unsafe way. For example, casting
<code class="verbatim">char **</code> to <code class="verbatim">const char **</code> is unsafe, as in this example: <em>* p is
char ** value. *</em> const char <strong>*q = (const char *</strong>) p; <em>* Assignment of
readonly string to const char * is OK. *</em> <strong>q = &#34;string&#34;; /</strong> Now char**
pointer points to read-only memory. */ **p = b;</dd>
<dt>
-Wcast-align
</dt>
<dd>Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required
alignment of the target is increased. For example, warn if a <code class="verbatim">char *</code>
is cast to an <code class="verbatim">int *</code> on machines where integers can only be accessed
at two- or four-byte boundaries.</dd>
<dt>
-Wcast-align=strict
</dt>
<dd>Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the

<code class="verbatim">char *</code> is cast to an <code class="verbatim">int *</code> regardless of the target machine.</dd>
<dt>
-Wcast-function-type
</dt>
<dd>Warn when a function pointer is cast to an
incompatible function pointer. In a cast involving function types with
a variable argument list only the types of initial arguments that are
provided are considered. Any parameter of pointer-type matches any
other pointer-type. Any benign differences in integral types are
ignored, like <code class="verbatim">int</code> vs. <code class="verbatim">long</code> on ILP32 targets. Likewise type
qualifiers are ignored. The function type <code class="verbatim">void (*) (void)</code> is special
and matches everything, which can be used to suppress this warning. In
a cast involving pointer to member types this warning warns whenever
the type cast is changing the pointer to member type. This warning is
enabled by <strong>-Wextra</strong>.</dd>

<dd>When compiling C, give string constants the type
<code class="verbatim">const</code> char[/=length=/=]= so that copying the address of one into a

you find at compile time code that can try to write into a string
constant, but only if you have been very careful about using <code class="verbatim">const</code>
in declarations and prototypes. Otherwise, it is just a nuisance. This
is why we did not make <strong>-Wall</strong> request these warnings. When compiling
C++, warn about the deprecated conversion from string literals to
<code class="verbatim">char *</code>. This warning is enabled by default for C++ programs.</dd>

<dd>By default, language front ends complain
when a command-line option is valid, but not applicable to that front
end. This may be disabled with <strong>-Wno-complain-wrong-lang</strong>, which is
mostly useful when invoking a single compiler driver for multiple
source files written in different languages, for example: $ g++
-fno-rtti a.cc b.f90 The driver <em>g++</em> invokes the C++ front end to
compile <em>a.cc</em> and the Fortran front end to compile <em>b.f90</em>. The
latter front end diagnoses <strong>f951: Warning: command-line option
&#39;-fno-rtti&#39; is valid for C++/D/ObjC++ but not for Fortran</strong>, which may
be disabled with <strong>-Wno-complain-wrong-lang</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wconversion
</dt>
<dd>Warn for implicit conversions that may alter a value.
This includes conversions between real and integer, like <code class="verbatim">abs (x)</code>
when <code class="verbatim">x</code> is <code class="verbatim">double</code>; conversions between signed and unsigned, like
<code class="verbatim">unsigned ui = -1</code>; and conversions to smaller types, like
<code class="verbatim">sqrtf (M_PI)</code>. Do not warn for explicit casts like <code class="verbatim">abs</code> ((int) x)
and <code class="verbatim">ui = (unsigned) -1</code>, or if the value is not changed by the
conversion like in <code class="verbatim">abs (2.0)</code>. Warnings about conversions between
signed and unsigned integers can be disabled by using
<strong>-Wno-sign-conversion</strong>. For C++, also warn for confusing overload
resolution for user-defined conversions; and conversions that never
use a type conversion operator: conversions to <code class="verbatim">void</code>, the same type,
a base class or a reference to them. Warnings about conversions
between signed and unsigned integers are disabled by default in C++
unless <strong>-Wsign-conversion</strong> is explicitly enabled. Warnings about
conversion from arithmetic on a small type back to that type are only
given with <strong>-Warith-conversion</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wdangling-else
</dt>
<dd>Warn about constructions where there may be
confusion to which <code class="verbatim">if</code> statement an <code class="verbatim">else</code> branch belongs. Here is an
example of such a case: { if (a) if (b) foo (); else bar (); } In
C/C++, every <code class="verbatim">else</code> branch belongs to the innermost possible <code class="verbatim">if</code>
statement, which in this example is <code class="verbatim">if (b)</code>. This is often not what
the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above example by
indentation the programmer chose. When there is the potential for this
confusion, GCC issues a warning when this flag is specified. To
eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around the innermost <code class="verbatim">if</code>
statement so there is no way the <code class="verbatim">else</code> can belong to the enclosing
<code class="verbatim">if</code>. The resulting code looks like this: { if (a) { if (b) foo ();
else bar (); } } This warning is enabled by <strong>-Wparentheses</strong>.</dd>

<p>Warn about uses of pointers (or C++ references) to objects with
automatic storage duration after their lifetime has ended. This includes
local variables declared in nested blocks, compound literals and other
unnamed temporary objects. In addition, warn about storing the address

optimization levels but may yield different results with optimization
than without.</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
-Wdangling-pointer=1
</dt>
<dd>At level 1 the warning diagnoses only
unconditional uses of dangling pointers. For example int f (int c1,
int c2, x) { char *p = strchr ((char[]){ c1, c2 }, c3); // warning:
dangling pointer to a compound literal return p ? *p : x; } In the
following function the store of the address of the local variable <code class="verbatim">x</code>

in *p *p = &amp;x; }</dd>
<dt>
-Wdangling-pointer=2
</dt>
<dd>At level 2, in addition to unconditional uses
the warning also diagnoses conditional uses of dangling pointers. For
example, because the array <em>a</em> in the following function is out of

between an enumerated type and an integer type in declarations. For
example: enum E { l = -1, z = 0, g = 1 }; int foo(void); enum E
foo(void); In C, an enumerated type is compatible with <code class="verbatim">char</code>, a
signed integer type, or an unsigned integer type. However, since the
choice of the underlying type of an enumerated type is
implementation-defined, such mismatches may cause portability issues.
In C++, such mismatches are an error. In C, this warning is enabled by

-Wsizeof-array-div
</dt>
<dd>Warn about divisions of two sizeof operators
when the first one is applied to an array and the divisor does not
equal the size of the array element. In such a case, the computation
will not yield the number of elements in the array, which is likely
what the user intended. This warning warns e.g. about int fn () { int
arr[10]; return sizeof (arr) / sizeof (short); } This warning is
enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wsizeof-pointer-div
</dt>
<dd>Warn for suspicious divisions of two sizeof

pointer, and suggests a possible fix, or about
<code class="verbatim">memcpy (&amp;foo, ptr, sizeof (&amp;foo));</code>. <strong>-Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess</strong>
also warns about calls to bounded string copy functions like <code class="verbatim">strncat</code>
or <code class="verbatim">strncpy</code> that specify as the bound a <code class="verbatim">sizeof</code> expression of the
source array. For example, in the following function the call to
<code class="verbatim">strncat</code> specifies the size of the source string as the bound. That
is almost certainly a mistake and so the call is diagnosed. void
make_file (const char *name) { char path[PATH_MAX]; strncpy (path,
name, sizeof path - 1); strncat (path, &#34;.text&#34;, sizeof &#34;.text&#34;); … }

<dd>Warn for suspicious calls to the <code class="verbatim">memset</code>
built-in function, if the first argument references an array, and the
third argument is a number equal to the number of elements, but not
equal to the size of the array in memory. This indicates that the user
has omitted a multiplication by the element size. This warning is
enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wmemset-transposed-args
</dt>
<dd>Warn for suspicious calls to the <code class="verbatim">memset</code>
built-in function where the second argument is not zero and the third
argument is zero. For example, the call <code class="verbatim">memset (buf, sizeof buf, 0)</code>
is diagnosed because <code class="verbatim">memset (buf, 0, sizeof buf)</code> was meant instead.
The diagnostic is only emitted if the third argument is a literal
zero. Otherwise, if it is an expression that is folded to zero, or a
cast of zero to some type, it is far less likely that the arguments
have been mistakenly transposed and no warning is emitted. This
warning is enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong>.</dd>

<p>Warn about suspicious uses of address expressions. These
include comparing the address of a function or a declared object to
the null pointer constant such as in void f (void); void g (void) { if

of a pointer to a string literal, such as in void f (const char *x) {

subtraction for equality to null, such as in void f (const int *p, int</p>
<ol>
<li>{ return p + i == NULL; } Such uses typically indicate a programmer</li>
</ol>
<p>error: the address of most functions and objects necessarily evaluates
to true (the exception are weak symbols), so their use in a
conditional might indicate missing parentheses in a function call or a
missing dereference in an array expression. The subset of the warning
for object pointers can be suppressed by casting the pointer operand
to an integer type such as <code class="verbatim">intptr_t</code> or <code class="verbatim">uintptr_t</code>. Comparisons
against string literals result in unspecified behavior and are not
portable, and suggest the intent was to call <code class="verbatim">strcmp</code>. The warning is
suppressed if the suspicious expression is the result of macro
expansion. <strong>-Waddress</strong> warning is enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-address-of-packed-member

&amp;&amp; a &lt; 0) { … }</dd>
<dt>
-Wlogical-not-parentheses
</dt>
<dd>Warn about logical not used on the left
hand side operand of a comparison. This option does not warn if the
right operand is considered to be a boolean expression. Its purpose is

… } It is possible to suppress the warning by wrapping the LHS into
parentheses: if ((!a) &gt; 1) { … } This warning is enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong>.</dd>

-Waggregate-return
</dt>
<dd>Warn if any functions that return structures or
unions are defined or called. (In languages where you can return an
array, this also elicits a warning.)</dd>

</dt>
<dd>Warn if in a loop with constant
number of iterations the compiler detects undefined behavior in some
statement during one or more of the iterations.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-attributes
</dt>
<dd>Do not warn if an unexpected <code class="verbatim">_ _attribute_ _</code> is
used, such as unrecognized attributes, function attributes applied to
variables, etc. This does not stop errors for incorrect use of
supported attributes. Additionally, using <strong>-Wno-attributes=</strong>, it is
possible to suppress warnings about unknown scoped attributes (in
C++11 and C2X). For example, <strong>-Wno-attributes=vendor::attr</strong> disables
warning about the following declaration: <a href="vendor::attr">vendor::attr</a> void f(); It
is also possible to disable warning about all attributes in a
namespace using <strong>-Wno-attributes=vendor::</strong> which prevents warning
about both of these declarations: <a href="vendor::safe">vendor::safe</a> void f();
<a href="vendor::unsafe">vendor::unsafe</a> void f2(); Note that <strong>-Wno-attributes=</strong> does not
imply <strong>-Wno-attributes</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-builtin-declaration-mismatch
</dt>
<dd>Warn if a built-in function is
declared with an incompatible signature or as a non-function, or when
a built-in function declared with a type that does not include a
prototype is called with arguments whose promoted types do not match
those expected by the function. When <strong>-Wextra</strong> is specified, also warn
when a built-in function that takes arguments is declared without a
prototype. The <strong>-Wbuiltin-declaration-mismatch</strong> warning is enabled by
default. To avoid the warning include the appropriate header to bring
the prototypes of built-in functions into scope. For example, the call
to <code class="verbatim">memset</code> below is diagnosed by the warning because the function
expects a value of type <code class="verbatim">size_t</code> as its argument but the type of <code class="verbatim">32</code>
is <code class="verbatim">int</code>. With <strong>-Wextra</strong>, the declaration of the function is diagnosed
as well. extern void* memset (); void f (void *d) { memset (d, \0,
32); }</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-builtin-macro-redefined
</dt>
<dd>Do not warn if certain built-in macros
are redefined. This suppresses warnings for redefinition of
<code class="verbatim">_ _TIMESTAMP_ _</code>, <code class="verbatim">_ _TIME_ _</code>, <code class="verbatim">_ _DATE_ _</code>, <code class="verbatim">_ _FILE_ _</code>, and
<code class="verbatim">_ _BASE_FILE_ _</code>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wstrict-prototypes (C and Objective-C only)

old-style function definition is permitted without a warning if
preceded by a declaration that specifies the argument types.)</dd>
<dt>
-Wold-style-declaration (C and Objective-C only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn for
obsolescent usages, according to the C Standard, in a declaration. For
example, warn if storage-class specifiers like <code class="verbatim">static</code> are not the
first things in a declaration. This warning is also enabled by
<strong>-Wextra</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wold-style-definition (C and Objective-C only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn if an
old-style function definition is used. A warning is given even if
there is a previous prototype. A definition using <strong>()</strong> is not
considered an old-style definition in C2X mode, because it is
equivalent to <strong>(void)</strong> in that case, but is considered an old-style
definition for older standards.</dd>
<dt>
-Wmissing-parameter-type (C and Objective-C only)
</dt>
<dd>A function
parameter is declared without a type specifier in K&amp;R-style functions:
void foo(bar) { } This warning is also enabled by <strong>-Wextra</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wmissing-prototypes (C and Objective-C only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn if a global
function is defined without a previous prototype declaration. This
warning is issued even if the definition itself provides a prototype.
Use this option to detect global functions that do not have a matching
prototype declaration in a header file. This option is not valid for
C++ because all function declarations provide prototypes and a
non-matching declaration declares an overload rather than conflict
with an earlier declaration. Use <strong>-Wmissing-declarations</strong> to detect
missing declarations in C++.</dd>
<dt>
-Wmissing-declarations
</dt>
<dd>Warn if a global function is defined without
a previous declaration. Do so even if the definition itself provides a
prototype. Use this option to detect global functions that are not
declared in header files. In C, no warnings are issued for functions
with previous non-prototype declarations; use <strong>-Wmissing-prototypes</strong>
to detect missing prototypes. In C++, no warnings are issued for
function templates, or for inline functions, or for functions in
anonymous namespaces.</dd>
<dt>
-Wmissing-field-initializers
</dt>
<dd>Warn if a structure&#39;s initializer has
some fields missing. For example, the following code causes such a
warning, because <code class="verbatim">x.h</code> is implicitly zero: struct s { int f, g, h; };
struct s x = { 3, 4 }; This option does not warn about designated
initializers, so the following modification does not trigger a
warning: struct s { int f, g, h; }; struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };
In C this option does not warn about the universal zero initializer <strong>{
0 }</strong>: struct s { int f, g, h; }; struct s x = { 0 }; Likewise, in C++
this option does not warn about the empty { } initializer, for
example: struct s { int f, g, h; }; s x = { }; This warning is
included in <strong>-Wextra</strong>. To get other <strong>-Wextra</strong> warnings without this
one, use <strong>-Wextra -Wno-missing-field-initializers</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-missing-requires
</dt>
<dd>By default, the compiler warns about a
concept-id appearing as a C++20 simple-requirement: bool satisfied =
requires { C&lt;T&gt; }; Here <strong>satisfied</strong> will be true if <strong>C&lt;T&gt;</strong> is a valid
expression, which it is for all T. Presumably the user meant to write
bool satisfied = requires { requires C&lt;T&gt; }; so <strong>satisfied</strong> is only
true if concept <strong>C</strong> is satisfied for type <strong>T</strong>. This warning can be
disabled with <strong>-Wno-missing-requires</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-missing-template-keyword
</dt>
<dd>The member access tokens ., -&gt; and ::
must be followed by the <code class="verbatim">template</code> keyword if the parent object is
dependent and the member being named is a template. template &lt;class X&gt;
void DoStuff (X x) { x.template DoSomeOtherStuff&lt;X&gt;(); <em>/ Good.
x.DoMoreStuff&lt;X&gt;(); /</em> Warning, x is dependent. } In rare cases it is
possible to get false positives. To silence this, wrap the expression
in parentheses. For example, the following is treated as a template,
even where m and N are integers: void NotATemplate (my_class t) { int
N = 5; bool test = t.m &lt; N &gt; (0); <em>/ Treated as a template. test =
(t.m &lt; N) &gt; (0); /</em> Same meaning, but not treated as a template. }
This warning can be disabled with <strong>-Wno-missing-template-keyword</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-multichar
</dt>
<dd>Do not warn if a multicharacter constant (<strong>&#39;FOOF&#39;</strong>)
is used. Usually they indicate a typo in the user&#39;s code, as they have
implementation-defined values, and should not be used in portable
code.</dd>
<dt>
-Wnormalized=[none|id|nfc|nfkc]
</dt>
<dd>In ISO C and ISO C++, two
identifiers are different if they are different sequences of
characters. However, sometimes when characters outside the basic ASCII
character set are used, you can have two different character sequences
that look the same. To avoid confusion, the ISO 10646 standard sets
out some <em>normalization rules</em> which when applied ensure that two
sequences that look the same are turned into the same sequence. GCC
can warn you if you are using identifiers that have not been
normalized; this option controls that warning. There are four levels
of warning supported by GCC. The default is <strong>-Wnormalized=nfc</strong>, which
warns about any identifier that is not in the ISO 10646 &#34;C&#34; normalized
form, <em>NFC</em>. NFC is the recommended form for most uses. It is
equivalent to <strong>-Wnormalized</strong>. Unfortunately, there are some characters
allowed in identifiers by ISO C and ISO C++ that, when turned into
NFC, are not allowed in identifiers. That is, there&#39;s no way to use
these symbols in portable ISO C or C++ and have all your identifiers
in NFC. <strong>-Wnormalized=id</strong> suppresses the warning for these characters.
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will
correct this, which is why this option is not the default. You can
switch the warning off for all characters by writing
<strong>-Wnormalized=none</strong> or <strong>-Wno-normalized</strong>. You should only do this if
you are using some other normalization scheme (like &#34;D&#34;), because
otherwise you can easily create bugs that are literally impossible to
see. Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look
identical in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once
formatting has been applied. For instance <code class="verbatim">\u207F</code>, &#34;SUPERSCRIPT LATIN
SMALL LETTER N&#34;, displays just like a regular <code class="verbatim">n</code> that has been placed
in a superscript. ISO 10646 defines the <em>NFKC</em> normalization scheme to
convert all these into a standard form as well, and GCC warns if your
code is not in NFKC if you use <strong>-Wnormalized=nfkc</strong>. This warning is
comparable to warning about every identifier that contains the letter
O because it might be confused with the digit 0, and so is not the
default, but may be useful as a local coding convention if the
programming environment cannot be fixed to display these characters
distinctly.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-attribute-warning

<dd>Do not warn about usage of functions
declared with <code class="verbatim">warning</code> attribute. By default, this warning is

option can be used to relax the cost model.</dd>
<dt>
-Woverride-init (C and Objective-C only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn if an initialized
field without side effects is overridden when using designated

-Wno-override-init-side-effects (C and Objective-C only)
</dt>
<dd>Do not
warn if an initialized field with side effects is overridden when
using designated initializers. This warning is enabled by default.</dd>
<dt>
-Wpacked
</dt>
<dd>Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the
packed attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure.
Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit. For instance,
in this code, the variable <code class="verbatim">f.x</code> in <code class="verbatim">struct bar</code> is misaligned even
though <code class="verbatim">struct bar</code> does not itself have the packed attribute: struct
foo { int x; char a, b, c, d; } _ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">attribute</span> _((packed)); struct bar
{ char z; struct foo f; };</dd>
<dt>
-Wnopacked-bitfield-compat
</dt>
<dd>The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of GCC
ignore the <code class="verbatim">packed</code> attribute on bit-fields of type <code class="verbatim">char</code>. This was
fixed in GCC 4.4 but the change can lead to differences in the
structure layout. GCC informs you when the offset of such a field has
changed in GCC 4.4. For example there is no longer a 4-bit padding
between field <code class="verbatim">a</code> and <code class="verbatim">b</code> in this structure: struct foo { char a:4;
char b:8; } _ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">attribute</span> _ ((packed)); This warning is enabled by
default. Use <strong>-Wno-packed-bitfield-compat</strong> to disable this warning.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd>-Wpacked-not-aligned (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++
only) :: Warn if a structure field with explicitly specified alignment
in a packed struct or union is misaligned. For example, a warning will
be issued on <code class="verbatim">struct S</code>, like, <code class="verbatim">warning: alignment 1 of</code> struct S is
less than 8, in this code: struct _ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">attribute</span> _ ((aligned (8))) S8 {
char a[8]; }; struct _ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">attribute</span> _ ((packed)) S { struct S8 s8; };
This warning is enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wpadded
</dt>
<dd>Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to
align an element of the structure or to align the whole structure.
Sometimes when this happens it is possible to rearrange the fields of
the structure to reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.</dd>
<dt>
-Wredundant-decls
</dt>
<dd>Warn if anything is declared more than once in
the same scope, even in cases where multiple declaration is valid and
changes nothing.</dd>
<dt>
-Wrestrict
</dt>
<dd>Warn when an object referenced by a <code class="verbatim">restrict</code>-qualified
parameter (or, in C++, a <code class="verbatim">_ _restrict</code>-qualified parameter) is aliased
by another argument, or when copies between such objects overlap. For
example, the call to the <code class="verbatim">strcpy</code> function below attempts to truncate
the string by replacing its initial characters with the last four.
However, because the call writes the terminating NUL into <code class="verbatim">a[4]</code>, the
copies overlap and the call is diagnosed. void foo (void) { char a[] =
&#34;abcd1234&#34;; strcpy (a, a + 4); … } The <strong>-Wrestrict</strong> option detects
some instances of simple overlap even without optimization but works
best at <strong>-O2</strong> and above. It is included in <strong>-Wall</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wnested-externs (C and Objective-C only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn if an <code class="verbatim">extern</code>
declaration is encountered within a function.</dd>
<dt>
-Winline
</dt>
<dd>Warn if a function that is declared as inline cannot be
inlined. Even with this option, the compiler does not warn about
failures to inline functions declared in system headers. The compiler
uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not to inline a
function. For example, the compiler takes into account the size of the
function being inlined and the amount of inlining that has already
been done in the current function. Therefore, seemingly insignificant
changes in the source program can cause the warnings produced by
<strong>-Winline</strong> to appear or disappear.</dd>
<dt>
-Winterference-size
</dt>
<dd>Warn about use of C++17
<code class="verbatim">std::hardware_destructive_interference_size</code> without specifying its
value with <strong>–param destructive-interference-size</strong>. Also warn about
questionable values for that option. This variable is intended to be
used for controlling class layout, to avoid false sharing in
concurrent code: struct independent_fields {
alignas(std::hardware_destructive_interference_size) std::atomic&lt;int&gt;
one; alignas(std::hardware_destructive_interference_size)
std::atomic&lt;int&gt; two; }; Here <strong>one</strong> and <strong>two</strong> are intended to be far
enough apart that stores to one won&#39;t require accesses to the other to
reload the cache line. By default, <strong>–param
destructive-interference-size</strong> and <strong>–param
constructive-interference-size</strong> are set based on the current <strong>-mtune</strong>
option, typically to the L1 cache line size for the particular target
CPU, sometimes to a range if tuning for a generic target. So all
translation units that depend on ABI compatibility for the use of
these variables must be compiled with the same <strong>-mtune</strong> (or <strong>-mcpu</strong>).
If ABI stability is important, such as if the use is in a header for a
library, you should probably not use the hardware interference size
variables at all. Alternatively, you can force a particular value with
<strong>–param</strong>. If you are confident that your use of the variable does not
affect ABI outside a single build of your project, you can turn off
the warning with <strong>-Wno-interference-size</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wint-in-bool-context
</dt>
<dd>Warn for suspicious use of integer values
where boolean values are expected, such as conditional expressions
(?:) using non-boolean integer constants in boolean context, like
<code class="verbatim">if (a &lt;</code> b ? 2 : 3)=. Or left shifting of signed integers in boolean
context, like <code class="verbatim">for (a = 0; 1 &lt;&lt; a; a++);</code>. Likewise for all kinds of
multiplications regardless of the data type. This warning is enabled
by <strong>-Wall</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast
</dt>
<dd>Suppress warnings from casts to pointer
type of an integer of a different size. In C++, casting to a pointer
type of smaller size is an error. <strong>Wint-to-pointer-cast</strong> is enabled by
default.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast (C and Objective-C only)
</dt>

<dd>Don&#39;t diagnose invalid forms of delimited or named
escape sequences which are treated as separate tokens. <strong>Wunicode</strong> is

<dd>Warn if <code class="verbatim">long long</code> type is used. This is enabled by
either <strong>-Wpedantic</strong> or <strong>-Wtraditional</strong> in ISO C90 and C++98 modes. To
inhibit the warning messages, use <strong>-Wno-long-long</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wvariadic-macros
</dt>
<dd>Warn if variadic macros are used in ISO C90 mode,
or if the GNU alternate syntax is used in ISO C99 mode. This is
enabled by either <strong>-Wpedantic</strong> or <strong>-Wtraditional</strong>. To inhibit the
warning messages, use <strong>-Wno-variadic-macros</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-varargs
</dt>
<dd>Do not warn upon questionable usage of the macros used
to handle variable arguments like <code class="verbatim">va_start</code>. These warnings are
enabled by default.</dd>
<dt>
-Wvector-operation-performance
</dt>
<dd>Warn if vector operation is not
implemented via SIMD capabilities of the architecture. Mainly useful
for the performance tuning. Vector operation can be implemented
<code class="verbatim">piecewise</code>, which means that the scalar operation is performed on
every vector element; <code class="verbatim">in parallel</code>, which means that the vector
operation is implemented using scalars of wider type, which normally
is more performance efficient; and <code class="verbatim">as a single scalar</code>, which means
that vector fits into a scalar type.</dd>
<dt>
-Wvla
</dt>
<dd>Warn if a variable-length array is used in the code.
<strong>-Wno-vla</strong> prevents the <strong>-Wpedantic</strong> warning of the variable-length
array.</dd>
<dt>
-Wvla-larger-than=byte-size
</dt>
<dd>If this option is used, the compiler
warns for declarations of variable-length arrays whose size is either
unbounded, or bounded by an argument that allows the array size to
exceed <em>byte-size</em> bytes. This is similar to how
*-Walloca-larger-than=*/byte-size/ works, but with variable-length
arrays. Note that GCC may optimize small variable-length arrays of a
known value into plain arrays, so this warning may not get triggered
for such arrays. <strong>-Wvla-larger-than=PTRDIFF_MAX</strong> is enabled by default
but is typically only effective when <strong>-ftree-vrp</strong> is active (default
for <strong>-O2</strong> and above). See also *-Walloca-larger-than=*/byte-size/.</dd>
<dt>
-Wno-vla-larger-than
</dt>
<dd>Disable <strong>-Wvla-larger-than=</strong> warnings. The
option is equivalent to <strong>-Wvla-larger-than=SIZE_MAX</strong> or larger.</dd>
<dt>
-Wvla-parameter
</dt>
<dd>Warn about redeclarations of functions involving
arguments of Variable Length Array types of inconsistent kinds or
forms, and enable the detection of out-of-bounds accesses to such
parameters by warnings such as <strong>-Warray-bounds</strong>. If the first function
declaration uses the VLA form the bound specified in the array is
assumed to be the minimum number of elements expected to be provided
in calls to the function and the maximum number of elements accessed
by it. Failing to provide arguments of sufficient size or accessing
more than the maximum number of elements may be diagnosed. For
example, the warning triggers for the following redeclarations because
the first one allows an array of any size to be passed to <code class="verbatim">f</code> while
the second one specifies that the array argument must have at least
<code class="verbatim">n</code> elements. In addition, calling <code class="verbatim">f</code> with the associated VLA bound
parameter in excess of the actual VLA bound triggers a warning as
well. void f (int n, int[n]); // warning: argument 2 previously
declared as a VLA void f (int, int[]); void g (int n) { if (n &gt; 4)
return; int a[n]; // warning: access to a by f may be out of bounds f
(sizeof a, a); … } <strong>-Wvla-parameter</strong> is included in <strong>-Wall</strong>. The
<strong>-Warray-parameter</strong> option triggers warnings for similar problems
involving ordinary array arguments.</dd>
<dt>
-Wvolatile-register-var
</dt>
<dd>Warn if a register variable is declared
volatile. The volatile modifier does not inhibit all optimizations
that may eliminate reads and/or writes to register variables. This
warning is enabled by <strong>-Wall</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wxor-used-as-pow (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn
about uses of <code class="verbatim">^</code>, the exclusive or operator, where it appears the
user meant exponentiation. Specifically, the warning occurs when the
left-hand side is the decimal constant 2 or 10 and the right-hand side
is also a decimal constant. In C and C++, <code class="verbatim">^</code> means exclusive or,
whereas in some other languages (e.g. TeX and some versions of BASIC)
it means exponentiation. This warning is enabled by default. It can be
silenced by converting one of the operands to hexadecimal.</dd>
<dt>
-Wdisabled-optimization
</dt>
<dd>Warn if a requested optimization pass is
disabled. This warning does not generally indicate that there is
anything wrong with your code; it merely indicates that GCC&#39;s
optimizers are unable to handle the code effectively. Often, the
problem is that your code is too big or too complex; GCC refuses to
optimize programs when the optimization itself is likely to take
inordinate amounts of time.</dd>
<dt>
-Wpointer-sign (C and Objective-C only)
</dt>
<dd>Warn for pointer argument
passing or assignment with different signedness. This option is only
supported for C and Objective-C. It is implied by <strong>-Wall</strong> and by
<strong>-Wpedantic</strong>, which can be disabled with <strong>-Wno-pointer-sign</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wstack-protector
</dt>
<dd>This option is only active when
<strong>-fstack-protector</strong> is active. It warns about functions that are not
protected against stack smashing.</dd>
<dt>
-Woverlength-strings
</dt>
<dd>Warn about string constants that are longer
than the &#34;minimum maximum&#34; length specified in the C standard. Modern
compilers generally allow string constants that are much longer than
the standard&#39;s minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
using longer strings. The limit applies <em>after</em> string constant
concatenation, and does not count the trailing NUL. In C90, the limit
was 509 characters; in C99, it was raised to 4095. C++98 does not
specify a normative minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength
strings in C++. This option is implied by <strong>-Wpedantic</strong>, and can be
disabled with <strong>-Wno-overlength-strings</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Wunsuffixed-float-constants (C and Objective-C only)
</dt>
<dd>Issue a
warning for any floating constant that does not have a suffix. When
used together with <strong>-Wsystem-headers</strong> it warns about such constants in
system header files. This can be useful when preparing code to use

floating-point extension to C99.</dd>

<dd>This option enables an static analysis of program flow
which looks for &#34;interesting&#34; interprocedural paths through the code,

more expensive than other GCC warnings. In technical terms, it
performs coverage-guided symbolic execution of the code being

-Wno-analyzer-deref-before-check

<dd>This warning requires
<strong>-fanalyzer</strong>, which enables it; use <strong>-Wno-analyzer-deref-before-check</strong>
to disable it. This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in
which a pointer is checked for <code class="verbatim">NULL</code> <strong>after</strong> it has already been
dereferenced, suggesting that the pointer could have been NULL. Such
cases suggest that the check for NULL is either redundant, or that it
needs to be moved to before the pointer is dereferenced. This
diagnostic also considers values passed to a function argument marked
with <code class="verbatim">_ _attribute_ _((nonnull))</code> as requiring a non-NULL value, and
thus will complain if such values are checked for <code class="verbatim">NULL</code> after
returning from such a function call. This diagnostic is unlikely to be
reported when any level of optimization is enabled, as GCC&#39;s
optimization logic will typically consider such checks for NULL as
being redundant, and optimize them away before the analyzer &#34;sees&#34;
them. Hence optimization should be disabled when attempting to trigger
this diagnostic.</dd>

appear to lead to infinite recursion. Specifically, when the analyzer
&#34;sees&#34; a recursive call, it will compare the state of memory at the
entry to the new frame with that at the entry to the previous frame of
that function on the stack. The warning is issued if nothing in memory
appears to be changing; any changes observed to parameters or globals
are assumed to lead to termination of the recursion and thus suppress
the warning. This diagnostic is likely to miss cases of infinite
recursion that are convered to iteration by the optimizer before the
analyzer &#34;sees&#34; them. Hence optimization should be disabled when

diagnostic implemented in the C/C++ front ends, but is implemented
based on analyzing interprocedural paths, rather than merely parsing
the syntax tree. However, the analyzer does not prioritize detection
of such paths, so false negatives are more likely relative to other

</dt>
<dd>This warning requires both
<strong>-fanalyzer</strong> and <strong>-fanalyzer-checker=taint</strong> to enable it; use
<strong>-Wno-analyzer-tainted-allocation-size</strong> to disable it. This diagnostic
warns for paths through the code in which a value that could be under
an attacker&#39;s control is used as the size of an allocation without
being sanitized, so that an attacker could inject an excessively large
allocation and potentially cause a denial of service attack. See
CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value

-Wno-analyzer-tainted-assertion
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This warning requires both
<strong>-fanalyzer</strong> and <strong>-fanalyzer-checker=taint</strong> to enable it; use
<strong>-Wno-analyzer-tainted-assertion</strong> to disable it. This diagnostic warns
for paths through the code in which a value that could be under an
attacker&#39;s control is used as part of a condition without being first
sanitized, and that condition guards a call to a function marked with
attribute <code class="verbatim">noreturn</code> (such as the function <code class="verbatim">_ _builtin_unreachable</code>).
Such functions typically indicate abnormal termination of the program,
such as for assertion failure handlers. For example: assert
(some_tainted_value &lt; SOME_LIMIT); In such cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>when assertion-checking is enabled: an attacker could trigger a
denial of service by injecting an assertion failure</li>
<li>when assertion-checking is disabled, such as by defining <code class="verbatim">NDEBUG</code>,
an attacker could inject data that subverts the process, since it
presumably violates a precondition that is being assumed by the
code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that when assertion-checking is disabled, the assertions are
typically removed by the preprocessor before the analyzer has a chance
to &#34;see&#34; them, so this diagnostic can only generate warnings on builds
in which assertion-checking is enabled. For the purpose of this
warning, any function marked with attribute <code class="verbatim">noreturn</code> is considered
as a possible assertion failure handler, including
<code class="verbatim">_ _builtin_unreachable</code>. Note that these functions are sometimes
removed by the optimizer before the analyzer &#34;sees&#34; them. Hence
optimization should be disabled when attempting to trigger this
diagnostic. See CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
(<code class="verbatim">https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/617.html</code>). The warning can
also report problematic constructions such as switch
(some_tainted_value) { case 0: <em>* […etc; various valid cases
omitted…] *</em> break; default: _ _builtin_unreachable (); <em>* BUG:
attacker can trigger this *</em> } despite the above not being an
assertion failure, strictly speaking.</p>

</dl>
<p>The following options control the analyzer.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-fanalyzer-call-summaries
</dt>
<dd>Simplify interprocedural analysis by
computing the effect of certain calls, rather than exploring all paths
through the function from callsite to each possible return. If
enabled, call summaries are only used for functions with more than one
call site, and that are sufficiently complicated (as per *–param
analyzer-min-snodes-for-call-summary=*/value/).</dd>
<dt>
-fanalyzer-checker=name
</dt>
<dd>Restrict the analyzer to run just the named
checker, and enable it. Some checkers are disabled by default (even
with <strong>-fanalyzer</strong>), such as the <code class="verbatim">taint</code> checker that implements
<strong>-Wanalyzer-tainted-array-index</strong>, and this option is required to
enable them. <em>Note:</em> currently, <strong>-fanalyzer-checker=taint</strong> disables
the following warnings from <strong>-fanalyzer</strong>:
<strong>-Wanalyzer-deref-before-check</strong> -Wanalyzer-double-fclose
-Wanalyzer-double-free -Wanalyzer-exposure-through-output-file
-Wanalyzer-fd-access-mode-mismatch -Wanalyzer-fd-double-close

-Wanalyzer-unsafe-call-within-signal-handler -Wanalyzer-use-after-free
-Wanalyzer-va-list-leak -Wanalyzer-va-list-use-after-va-end</dd>
<dt>
-fno-analyzer-feasibility
</dt>
<dd>This option is intended for analyzer
developers. By default the analyzer verifies that there is a feasible
control flow path for each diagnostic it emits: that the conditions
that hold are not mutually exclusive. Diagnostics for which no
feasible path can be found are rejected. This filtering can be
suppressed with <strong>-fno-analyzer-feasibility</strong>, for debugging issues in
this code.</dd>
<dt>
-fanalyzer-fine-grained
</dt>
<dd>This option is intended for analyzer
developers. Internally the analyzer builds an &#34;exploded graph&#34; that
combines control flow graphs with data flow information. By default,
an edge in this graph can contain the effects of a run of multiple
statements within a basic block. With <strong>-fanalyzer-fine-grained</strong>, each
statement gets its own edge.</dd>
<dt>
-fanalyzer-show-duplicate-count
</dt>
<dd>This option is intended for
analyzer developers: if multiple diagnostics have been detected as
being duplicates of each other, it emits a note when reporting the
best diagnostic, giving the number of additional diagnostics that were
suppressed by the deduplication logic.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-analyzer-state-merge
</dt>
<dd>This option is intended for analyzer
developers. By default the analyzer attempts to simplify analysis by
merging sufficiently similar states at each program point as it builds
its &#34;exploded graph&#34;. With <strong>-fno-analyzer-state-merge</strong> this merging
can be suppressed, for debugging state-handling issues.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-analyzer-state-purge
</dt>
<dd>This option is intended for analyzer
developers. By default the analyzer attempts to simplify analysis by
purging aspects of state at a program point that appear to no longer
be relevant e.g. the values of locals that aren&#39;t accessed later in
the function and which aren&#39;t relevant to leak analysis. With
<strong>-fno-analyzer-state-purge</strong> this purging of state can be suppressed,
for debugging state-handling issues.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-analyzer-suppress-followups
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option is intended for
analyzer developers. By default the analyzer will stop exploring an
execution path after encountering certain diagnostics, in order to
avoid potentially issuing a cascade of follow-up diagnostics. The
diagnostics that terminate analysis along a path are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
*&lt;-Wanalyzer-null-argument&gt;
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
*&lt;-Wanalyzer-null-dereference&gt;
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
*&lt;-Wanalyzer-use-after-free&gt;
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
*&lt;-Wanalyzer-use-of-pointer-in-stale-stack-frame&gt;
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
*&lt;-Wanalyzer-use-of-uninitialized-value&gt;
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>With <strong>-fno-analyzer-suppress-followups</strong> the analyzer will continue to
explore such paths even after such diagnostics, which may be helpful
for debugging issues in the analyzer, or for microbenchmarks for
detecting undefined behavior.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-fanalyzer-transitivity
</dt>
<dd>This option enables transitivity of
constraints within the analyzer.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-analyzer-undo-inlining
</dt>
<dd>This option is intended for analyzer
developers. <strong>-fanalyzer</strong> runs relatively late compared to other code
analysis tools, and some optimizations have already been applied to
the code. In particular function inlining may have occurred, leading
to the interprocedural execution paths emitted by the analyzer
containing function frames that don&#39;t correspond to those in the
original source code. By default the analyzer attempts to reconstruct
the original function frames, and to emit events showing the inlined
calls. With <strong>-fno-analyzer-undo-inlining</strong> this attempt to reconstruct
the original frame information can be be disabled, which may be of
help when debugging issues in the analyzer.</dd>
<dt>
-fanalyzer-verbose-edges
</dt>
<dd>This option is intended for analyzer
developers. It enables more verbose, lower-level detail in the
descriptions of control flow within diagnostic paths.</dd>
<dt>
-fanalyzer-verbose-state-changes
</dt>
<dd>This option is intended for
analyzer developers. It enables more verbose, lower-level detail in
the descriptions of events relating to state machines within
diagnostic paths.</dd>
<dt>
-fanalyzer-verbosity=level
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option controls the complexity of
the control flow paths that are emitted for analyzer diagnostics. The
<em>level</em> can be one of:</p>
<ol>
<li value="0">At this level, interprocedural call and return events are
displayed, along with the most pertinent state-change events
relating to a diagnostic. For example, for a double-<code class="verbatim">free</code>
diagnostic, both calls to <code class="verbatim">free</code> will be shown.</li>
<li>As per the previous level, but also show events for the entry to
each function.</li>
<li>As per the previous level, but also show events relating to control
flow that are significant to triggering the issue (e.g. &#34;true path
taken&#34; at a conditional). This level is the default.</li>
<li>As per the previous level, but show all control flow events, not
just significant ones.</li>
<li>This level is intended for analyzer developers; it adds various
other events intended for debugging the analyzer.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>
-fdump-analyzer
</dt>
<dd>Dump internal details about what the analyzer is
doing to <em>file.analyzer.txt</em>. <strong>-fdump-analyzer-stderr</strong> overrides this
option.</dd>
<dt>
-fdump-analyzer-stderr
</dt>
<dd>Dump internal details about what the
analyzer is doing to stderr. This option overrides <strong>-fdump-analyzer</strong>.</dd>

<dd>Dump a textual representation of
the &#34;exploded graph&#34; to <em>file.eg.txt</em>.</dd>

-fdump-analyzer-exploded-nodes-3
</dt>
<dd>Dump a textual representation of
the &#34;exploded graph&#34; to one dump file per node, to <em>file.eg-id.txt</em>.
This is typically a large number of dump files.</dd>
<dt>
-fdump-analyzer-exploded-paths
</dt>
<dd>Dump a textual representation of the
&#34;exploded path&#34; for each diagnostic to <em>file.idx.kind.epath.txt</em>.</dd>
<dt>
-fdump-analyzer-feasibility
</dt>
<dd>Dump internal details about the
analyzer&#39;s search for feasible paths. The details are written in a
form suitable for viewing with GraphViz to filenames of the form
<em>file.*.fg.dot</em>, <em>file.*.tg.dot</em>, and <em>file.*.fpath.txt</em>.</dd>
<dt>
-fdump-analyzer-json
</dt>
<dd>Dump a compressed JSON representation of
analyzer internals to <em>file.analyzer.json.gz</em>. The precise format is
subject to change.</dd>
<dt>
-fdump-analyzer-state-purge
</dt>
<dd>As per <strong>-fdump-analyzer-supergraph</strong>,
dump a representation of the &#34;supergraph&#34; suitable for viewing with

<dd>Dump representations of the &#34;supergraph&#34;
suitable for viewing with GraphViz to <em>file.supergraph.dot</em> and to

the program, with interprocedural edges for calls and returns. The
second dump contains annotations showing nodes in the &#34;exploded graph&#34;

Options for Debugging Your Program
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-3">
<p>To tell GCC to emit extra information for use by a debugger, in almost
all cases you need only to add <strong>-g</strong> to your other options. Some debug
formats can co-exist (like DWARF with CTF) when each of them is enabled
explicitly by adding the respective command line option to your other
options.</p>
<p>
GCC allows you to use <strong>-g</strong> with <strong>-O</strong>. The shortcuts taken by optimized
code may occasionally be surprising: some variables you declared may not
exist at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect
it; some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values are already at hand; some statements may execute
in different places because they have been moved out of loops.
Nevertheless it is possible to debug optimized output. This makes it
reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.</p>
<p>
If you are not using some other optimization option, consider using
<strong>-Og</strong> with <strong>-g</strong>. With no <strong>-O</strong> option at all, some compiler passes that
collect information useful for debugging do not run at all, so that
<strong>-Og</strong> may result in a better debugging experience.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-g
</dt>
<dd>Produce debugging information in the operating system&#39;s native
format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF). GDB can work with this
debugging information. On most systems that use stabs format, <strong>-g</strong>
enables use of extra debugging information that only GDB can use; this
extra information makes debugging work better in GDB but probably
makes other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program. If you want
to control for certain whether to generate the extra information, use
<strong>-gvms</strong> (see below).</dd>
<dt>
-ggdb
</dt>
<dd>Produce debugging information for use by GDB. This means to
use the most expressive format available (DWARF, stabs, or the native
format if neither of those are supported), including GDB extensions if
at all possible.</dd>
<dt>
-gdwarf
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-gdwarf-version
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is supported).
The value of <em>version</em> may be either 2, 3, 4 or 5; the default version
for most targets is 5 (with the exception of VxWorks, TPF and Darwin/Mac
OS X, which default to version 2, and AIX, which defaults to version 4).
Note that with DWARF Version 2, some ports require and always use some
non-conflicting DWARF 3 extensions in the unwind tables. Version 4 may
require GDB 7.0 and <strong>-fvar-tracking-assignments</strong> for maximum benefit.
Version 5 requires GDB 8.0 or higher. GCC no longer supports DWARF
Version 1, which is substantially different than Version 2 and later.
For historical reasons, some other DWARF-related options such as
<strong>-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm</strong>) retain a reference to DWARF Version 2 in their
names, but apply to all currently-supported versions of DWARF.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-gbtf
</dt>
<dd>Request BTF debug information. BTF is the default debugging
format for the eBPF target. On other targets, like x86, BTF debug
information can be generated along with DWARF debug information when
both of the debug formats are enabled explicitly via their respective
command line options.</dd>
<dt>
-gctf
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-gctflevel
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Request CTF debug information and use level to specify how much CTF
debug information should be produced. If <strong>-gctf</strong> is specified without a
value for level, the default level of CTF debug information is 2. CTF
debug information can be generated along with DWARF debug information
when both of the debug formats are enabled explicitly via their
respective command line options. Level 0 produces no CTF debug
information at all. Thus, <strong>-gctf0</strong> negates <strong>-gctf</strong>. Level 1 produces CTF
information for tracebacks only. This includes callsite information, but
does not include type information. Level 2 produces type information for
entities (functions, data objects etc.) at file-scope or global-scope
only.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-gvms
</dt>
<dd>Produce debugging information in Alpha/VMS debug format (if
that is supported). This is the format used by DEBUG on Alpha/VMS
systems.</dd>
<dt>
-glevel
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-ggdblevel
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-gvmslevel
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Request debugging information and also use <em>level</em> to specify how much
information. The default level is 2. Level 0 produces no debug
information at all. Thus, <strong>-g0</strong> negates <strong>-g</strong>. Level 1 produces minimal
information, enough for making backtraces in parts of the program that
you don&#39;t plan to debug. This includes descriptions of functions and
external variables, and line number tables, but no information about
local variables. Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the
macro definitions present in the program. Some debuggers support macro
expansion when you use <strong>-g3</strong>. If you use multiple <strong>-g</strong> options, with or
without level numbers, the last such option is the one that is
effective. <strong>-gdwarf</strong> does not accept a concatenated debug level, to
avoid confusion with *-gdwarf-*/level/. Instead use an additional
*-g*/level/ option to change the debug level for DWARF.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-symbols
</dt>
<dd>By default, no debug
information is produced for symbols that are not actually used. Use
this option if you want debug information for all symbols.</dd>
<dt>
-femit-class-debug-always
</dt>
<dd>Instead of emitting debugging information
for a C++ class in only one object file, emit it in all object files
using the class. This option should be used only with debuggers that
are unable to handle the way GCC normally emits debugging information
for classes because using this option increases the size of debugging
information by as much as a factor of two.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-merge-debug-strings
</dt>
<dd>Direct the linker to not merge together
strings in the debugging information that are identical in different
object files. Merging is not supported by all assemblers or linkers.
Merging decreases the size of the debug information in the output file
at the cost of increasing link processing time. Merging is enabled by
default.</dd>
<dt>
-fdebug-prefix-map=old=new
</dt>
<dd>When compiling files residing in
directory <em>old</em>, record debugging information describing them as if
the files resided in directory <em>new</em> instead. This can be used to
replace a build-time path with an install-time path in the debug info.
It can also be used to change an absolute path to a relative path by
using <em>.</em> for <em>new</em>. This can give more reproducible builds, which are
location independent, but may require an extra command to tell GDB
where to find the source files. See also <strong>-ffile-prefix-map</strong> and
<strong>-fcanon-prefix-map</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fvar-tracking
</dt>
<dd>Run variable tracking pass. It computes where
variables are stored at each position in code. Better debugging
information is then generated (if the debugging information format
supports this information). It is enabled by default when compiling
with optimization (<strong>-Os</strong>, <strong>-O</strong>, <strong>-O2</strong>, …), debugging information
(<strong>-g</strong>) and the debug info format supports it.</dd>
<dt>
-fvar-tracking-assignments
</dt>
<dd>Annotate assignments to user variables
early in the compilation and attempt to carry the annotations over
throughout the compilation all the way to the end, in an attempt to
improve debug information while optimizing. Use of <strong>-gdwarf-4</strong> is
recommended along with it. It can be enabled even if var-tracking is
disabled, in which case annotations are created and maintained, but
discarded at the end. By default, this flag is enabled together with
<strong>-fvar-tracking</strong>, except when selective scheduling is enabled.</dd>
<dt>
-gsplit-dwarf
</dt>
<dd>If DWARF debugging information is enabled, separate
as much debugging information as possible into a separate output file
with the extension <em>.dwo</em>. This option allows the build system to
avoid linking files with debug information. To be useful, this option
requires a debugger capable of reading <em>.dwo</em> files.</dd>
<dt>
-gdwarf32
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-gdwarf64
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>If DWARF debugging information is enabled, the <strong>-gdwarf32</strong> selects the
32-bit DWARF format and the <strong>-gdwarf64</strong> selects the 64-bit DWARF format.
The default is target specific, on most targets it is <strong>-gdwarf32</strong>
though. The 32-bit DWARF format is smaller, but can&#39;t support more than
2GiB of debug information in any of the DWARF debug information
sections. The 64-bit DWARF format allows larger debug information and
might not be well supported by all consumers yet.</p>

<p>Augment variable location lists with progressive view numbers implied
from the line number table. This enables debug information consumers to
inspect state at certain points of the program, even if no instructions
associated with the corresponding source locations are present at that
point. If the assembler lacks support for view numbers in line number
tables, this will cause the compiler to emit the line number table,
which generally makes them somewhat less compact. The augmented line
number tables and location lists are fully backward-compatible, so they
can be consumed by debug information consumers that are not aware of
these augmentations, but they won&#39;t derive any benefit from them either.
This is enabled by default when outputting DWARF 2 debug information at
the normal level, as long as there is assembler support,
<strong>-fvar-tracking-assignments</strong> is enabled and <strong>-gstrict-dwarf</strong> is not.
When assembler support is not available, this may still be enabled, but
it will force GCC to output internal line number tables, and if
<strong>-ginternal-reset-location-views</strong> is not enabled, that will most
certainly lead to silently mismatching location views. There is a
proposed representation for view numbers that is not backward compatible
with the location list format introduced in DWARF 5, that can be enabled
with <strong>-gvariable-location-views=incompat5</strong>. This option may be removed
in the future, is only provided as a reference implementation of the
proposed representation. Debug information consumers are not expected to

<dt>
-femit-struct-debug-detailed[=spec-list]
</dt>
<dd>Specify the struct-like
types for which the compiler generates debug information. The intent
is to reduce duplicate struct debug information between different
object files within the same program. This option is a detailed
version of <strong>-femit-struct-debug-reduced</strong> and
<strong>-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</strong>, which serves for most needs. A
specification has the
syntax[*dir:*|*ind:*][*ord:*|*gen:*](<strong>any*|*sys*|*base*|*none</strong>) The
optional first word limits the specification to structs that are used
directly (<strong>dir:</strong>) or used indirectly (<strong>ind:</strong>). A struct type is used
directly when it is the type of a variable, member. Indirect uses
arise through pointers to structs. That is, when use of an incomplete
struct is valid, the use is indirect. An example is <strong>struct one
direct; struct two * indirect;</strong>. The optional second word limits the
specification to ordinary structs (<strong>ord:</strong>) or generic structs
(<strong>gen:</strong>). Generic structs are a bit complicated to explain. For C++,
these are non-explicit specializations of template classes, or
non-template classes within the above. Other programming languages
have generics, but <strong>-femit-struct-debug-detailed</strong> does not yet
implement them. The third word specifies the source files for those
structs for which the compiler should emit debug information. The
values <strong>none</strong> and <strong>any</strong> have the normal meaning. The value <strong>base</strong>
means that the base of name of the file in which the type declaration
appears must match the base of the name of the main compilation file.
In practice, this means that when compiling <em>foo.c</em>, debug information
is generated for types declared in that file and <em>foo.h</em>, but not
other header files. The value <strong>sys</strong> means those types satisfying
<strong>base</strong> or declared in system or compiler headers. You may need to
experiment to determine the best settings for your application. The
default is <strong>-femit-struct-debug-detailed=all</strong>. This option works only
with DWARF debug output.</dd>

<dd>Normally, when producing DWARF
output, GCC avoids producing debug symbol output for types that are

to have GCC emit debugging information for all types declared in a
compilation unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used
in that compilation unit, for example if, in the debugger, you want to
cast a value to a type that is not actually used in your program (but
is declared). More often, however, this results in a significant
amount of wasted space.</dd>

Options That Control Optimization
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-3">
<p>These options control various sorts of optimizations.</p>
<p>
Without any optimization option, the compiler&#39;s goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results.
Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a breakpoint
between statements, you can then assign a new value to any variable or
change the program counter to any other statement in the function and
get exactly the results you expect from the source code.</p>
<p>
Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve the
performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time and
possibly the ability to debug the program.</p>
<p>
The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the
program. Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file mode
allows the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when
compiling each of them.</p>
<p>
Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag. Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.</p>
<p>
Most optimizations are completely disabled at <strong>-O0</strong> or if an <strong>-O</strong> level
is not set on the command line, even if individual optimization flags
are specified. Similarly, <strong>-Og</strong> suppresses many optimization passes.</p>
<p>
Depending on the target and how GCC was configured, a slightly different
set of optimizations may be enabled at each <strong>-O</strong> level than those listed
here. You can invoke GCC with <strong>-Q –help=optimizers</strong> to find out the
exact set of optimizations that are enabled at each level.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-O
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-O1
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Optimize. Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function. With <strong>-O</strong>, the compiler tries to
reduce code size and execution time, without performing any
optimizations that take a great deal of compilation time. <strong>-O</strong> turns on
the following optimization flags: <strong>-fauto-inc-dec</strong> -fbranch-count-reg
-fcombine-stack-adjustments -fcompare-elim -fcprop-registers -fdce
-fdefer-pop -fdelayed-branch -fdse -fforward-propagate

<dl>
<dt>
-O2
</dt>
<dd>Optimize even more. GCC performs nearly all supported
optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff. As compared
to <strong>-O</strong>, this option increases both compilation time and the
performance of the generated code. <strong>-O2</strong> turns on all optimization
flags specified by <strong>-O1</strong>. It also turns on the following optimization
flags: <strong>-falign-functions -falign-jumps</strong> -falign-labels -falign-loops
-fcaller-saves -fcode-hoisting -fcrossjumping -fcse-follow-jumps

computed gotos.</dd>

-O3
</dt>
<dd>Optimize yet more. <strong>-O3</strong> turns on all optimizations specified

<strong>-fgcse-after-reload</strong> -fipa-cp-clone -floop-interchange
-floop-unroll-and-jam -fpeel-loops -fpredictive-commoning
-fsplit-loops -fsplit-paths -ftree-loop-distribution

-O0
</dt>
<dd>Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected
results. This is the default.</dd>
<dt>
-Os
</dt>
<dd>Optimize for size. <strong>-Os</strong> enables all <strong>-O2</strong> optimizations except
those that often increase code size: <strong>-falign-functions -falign-jumps</strong>
-falign-labels -falign-loops -fprefetch-loop-arrays
-freorder-blocks-algorithm=stc It also enables <strong>-finline-functions</strong>,
causes the compiler to tune for code size rather than execution speed,
and performs further optimizations designed to reduce code size.</dd>
<dt>
-Ofast
</dt>
<dd>Disregard strict standards compliance. <strong>-Ofast</strong> enables all
<strong>-O3</strong> optimizations. It also enables optimizations that are not valid
for all standard-compliant programs. It turns on <strong>-ffast-math</strong>,
<strong>-fallow-store-data-races</strong> and the Fortran-specific <strong>-fstack-arrays</strong>,
unless <strong>-fmax-stack-var-size</strong> is specified, and <strong>-fno-protect-parens</strong>.
It turns off <strong>-fsemantic-interposition</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Og
</dt>
<dd>Optimize debugging experience. <strong>-Og</strong> should be the optimization
level of choice for the standard edit-compile-debug cycle, offering a
reasonable level of optimization while maintaining fast compilation
and a good debugging experience. It is a better choice than <strong>-O0</strong> for
producing debuggable code because some compiler passes that collect
debug information are disabled at <strong>-O0</strong>. Like <strong>-O0</strong>, <strong>-Og</strong> completely
disables a number of optimization passes so that individual options
controlling them have no effect. Otherwise <strong>-Og</strong> enables all <strong>-O1</strong>
optimization flags except for those that may interfere with debugging:
<strong>-fbranch-count-reg -fdelayed-branch</strong> -fdse -fif-conversion
-fif-conversion2 -finline-functions-called-once -fmove-loop-invariants
-fmove-loop-stores -fssa-phiopt -ftree-bit-ccp -ftree-dse -ftree-pta
-ftree-sra</dd>
<dt>
-Oz
</dt>
<dd>Optimize aggressively for size rather than speed. This may
increase the number of instructions executed if those instructions
require fewer bytes to encode. <strong>-Oz</strong> behaves similarly to <strong>-Os</strong>
including enabling most <strong>-O2</strong> optimizations.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you use multiple <strong>-O</strong> options, with or without level numbers, the
last such option is the one that is effective.</p>
<p>
Options of the form *-f*/flag/ specify machine-independent flags. Most
flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
<strong>-ffoo</strong> is <strong>-fno-foo</strong>. In the table below, only one of the forms is
listed—the one you typically use. You can figure out the other form by
either removing <strong>no-</strong> or adding it.</p>
<p>
The following options control specific optimizations. They are either
activated by <strong>-O</strong> options or are related to ones that are. You can use
the following flags in the rare cases when &#34;fine-tuning&#34; of
optimizations to be performed is desired.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-fno-defer-pop
</dt>
<dd>For machines that must pop arguments after a
function call, always pop the arguments as soon as each function
returns. At levels <strong>-O1</strong> and higher, <strong>-fdefer-pop</strong> is the default;
this allows the compiler to let arguments accumulate on the stack for
several function calls and pop them all at once.</dd>
<dt>
-fforward-propagate
</dt>
<dd>Perform a forward propagation pass on RTL. The
pass tries to combine two instructions and checks if the result can be
simplified. If loop unrolling is active, two passes are performed and
the second is scheduled after loop unrolling. This option is enabled
by default at optimization levels <strong>-O1</strong>, <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-ffp-contract=style
</dt>
<dd><strong>-ffp-contract=off</strong> disables floating-point
expression contraction. <strong>-ffp-contract=fast</strong> enables floating-point
expression contraction such as forming of fused multiply-add
operations if the target has native support for them.
<strong>-ffp-contract=on</strong> enables floating-point expression contraction if
allowed by the language standard. This is currently not implemented
and treated equal to <strong>-ffp-contract=off</strong>. The default is
<strong>-ffp-contract=fast</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fomit-frame-pointer
</dt>
<dd>Omit the frame pointer in functions that don&#39;t
need one. This avoids the instructions to save, set up and restore the
frame pointer; on many targets it also makes an extra register
available. On some targets this flag has no effect because the
standard calling sequence always uses a frame pointer, so it cannot be
omitted. Note that <strong>-fno-omit-frame-pointer</strong> doesn&#39;t guarantee the
frame pointer is used in all functions. Several targets always omit
the frame pointer in leaf functions. Enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and
higher.</dd>

<dd>Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.
Enabled at levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>

<dd>Optimize various standard C string functions
(e.g. <code class="verbatim">strlen</code>, <code class="verbatim">strchr</code> or <code class="verbatim">strcpy</code>) and their <code class="verbatim">_FORTIFY_SOURCE</code>
counterparts into faster alternatives. Enabled at levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-inline
</dt>
<dd>Do not expand any functions inline apart from those
marked with the <code class="verbatim">always_inline</code> attribute. This is the default when
not optimizing. Single functions can be exempted from inlining by
marking them with the <code class="verbatim">noinline</code> attribute.</dd>
<dt>
-finline-small-functions
</dt>
<dd>Integrate functions into their callers
when their body is smaller than expected function call code (so
overall size of program gets smaller). The compiler heuristically
decides which functions are simple enough to be worth integrating in
this way. This inlining applies to all functions, even those not
declared inline. Enabled at levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-findirect-inlining
</dt>
<dd>Inline also indirect calls that are discovered
to be known at compile time thanks to previous inlining. This option
has any effect only when inlining itself is turned on by the
<strong>-finline-functions</strong> or <strong>-finline-small-functions</strong> options. Enabled at
levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-finline-functions
</dt>
<dd>Consider all functions for inlining, even if
they are not declared inline. The compiler heuristically decides which
functions are worth integrating in this way. If all calls to a given
function are integrated, and the function is declared <code class="verbatim">static</code>, then
the function is normally not output as assembler code in its own
right. Enabled at levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>. Also enabled by
<strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and <strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-finline-functions-called-once
</dt>
<dd>Consider all <code class="verbatim">static</code> functions
called once for inlining into their caller even if they are not marked

<dt>
-fearly-inlining
</dt>
<dd>Inline functions marked by <code class="verbatim">always_inline</code> and
functions whose body seems smaller than the function call overhead
early before doing <strong>-fprofile-generate</strong> instrumentation and real
inlining pass. Doing so makes profiling significantly cheaper and
usually inlining faster on programs having large chains of nested
wrapper functions. Enabled by default.</dd>
<dt>
-fipa-sra
</dt>
<dd>Perform interprocedural scalar replacement of aggregates,
removal of unused parameters and replacement of parameters passed by

<strong>-O3</strong> and <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-finline-limit=n
</dt>
<dd>
<p>By default, GCC limits the size of functions that
can be inlined. This flag allows coarse control of this limit. <em>n</em> is
the size of functions that can be inlined in number of pseudo
instructions. Inlining is actually controlled by a number of
parameters, which may be specified individually by using <strong>–param</strong>
<em>name/*=*/value</em>. The *-finline-limit=*/n/ option sets some of these
parameters as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
max-inline-insns-single
</dt>
<dd>is set to /n//2.</dd>
<dt>
max-inline-insns-auto
</dt>
<dd>is set to /n//2.</dd>
</dl>
<p>See below for a documentation of the individual parameters controlling
inlining and for the defaults of these parameters. <em>Note:</em> there may
be no value to <strong>-finline-limit</strong> that results in default behavior.
<em>Note:</em> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context, an
abstract measurement of function&#39;s size. In no way does it represent a
count of assembly instructions and as such its exact meaning might
change from one release to an another.</p>

<dt>
-fno-keep-inline-dllexport

<dt>
-fkeep-inline-functions
</dt>
<dd>In C, emit <code class="verbatim">static</code> functions that are
declared <code class="verbatim">inline</code> into the object file, even if the function has been

optimization isn&#39;t turned on, even if the variables aren&#39;t referenced.
GCC enables this option by default. If you want to force the compiler
to check if a variable is referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the <strong>-fno-keep-static-consts</strong> option.</dd>
<dt>
-fmerge-constants
</dt>
<dd>Attempt to merge identical constants (string
constants and floating-point constants) across compilation units. This

<dt>
-fmerge-all-constants
</dt>
<dd>Attempt to merge identical constants and
identical variables. This option implies <strong>-fmerge-constants</strong>. In
addition to <strong>-fmerge-constants</strong> this considers e.g. even constant
initialized arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or
floating-point types. Languages like C or C++ require each variable,
including multiple instances of the same variable in recursive calls,
to have distinct locations, so using this option results in
non-conforming behavior.</dd>

-fmodulo-sched
</dt>
<dd>Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before
the first scheduling pass. This pass looks at innermost loops and
reorders their instructions by overlapping different iterations.</dd>
<dt>
-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves
</dt>
<dd>Perform more aggressive SMS-based
modulo scheduling with register moves allowed. By setting this flag
certain anti-dependences edges are deleted, which triggers the
generation of reg-moves based on the life-range analysis. This option
is effective only with <strong>-fmodulo-sched</strong> enabled.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-branch-count-reg
</dt>
<dd>Disable the optimization pass that scans for
opportunities to use &#34;decrement and branch&#34; instructions on a count
register instead of instruction sequences that decrement a register,
compare it against zero, and then branch based upon the result. This
option is only meaningful on architectures that support such
instructions, which include x86, PowerPC, IA-64 and S/390. Note that
the <strong>-fno-branch-count-reg</strong> option doesn&#39;t remove the decrement and
branch instructions from the generated instruction stream introduced
by other optimization passes. The default is <strong>-fbranch-count-reg</strong> at
<strong>-O1</strong> and higher, except for <strong>-Og</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-function-cse
</dt>
<dd>Do not put function addresses in registers; make
each instruction that calls a constant function contain the function&#39;s
address explicitly. This option results in less efficient code, but
some strange hacks that alter the assembler output may be confused by
the optimizations performed when this option is not used. The default
is <strong>-ffunction-cse</strong></dd>
<dt>
-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss
</dt>
<dd>If the target supports a BSS section,
GCC by default puts variables that are initialized to zero into BSS.
This can save space in the resulting code. This option turns off this
behavior because some programs explicitly rely on variables going to
the data section—e.g., so that the resulting executable can find the
beginning of that section and/or make assumptions based on that. The
default is <strong>-fzero-initialized-in-bss</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fthread-jumps
</dt>
<dd>Perform optimizations that check to see if a jump
branches to a location where another comparison subsumed by the first
is found. If so, the first branch is redirected to either the
destination of the second branch or a point immediately following it,
depending on whether the condition is known to be true or false.
Enabled at levels <strong>-O1</strong>, <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fsplit-wide-types
</dt>
<dd>When using a type that occupies multiple
registers, such as <code class="verbatim">long</code> long on a 32-bit system, split the registers
apart and allocate them independently. This normally generates better
code for those types, but may make debugging more difficult. Enabled
at levels <strong>-O1</strong>, <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fsplit-wide-types-early
</dt>
<dd>Fully split wide types early, instead of
very late. This option has no effect unless <strong>-fsplit-wide-types</strong> is
turned on. This is the default on some targets.</dd>
<dt>
-fcse-follow-jumps
</dt>
<dd>In common subexpression elimination (CSE), scan
through jump instructions when the target of the jump is not reached
by any other path. For example, when CSE encounters an <code class="verbatim">if</code> statement
with an <code class="verbatim">else</code> clause, CSE follows the jump when the condition tested
is false. Enabled at levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fcse-skip-blocks
</dt>
<dd>This is similar to <strong>-fcse-follow-jumps</strong>, but
causes CSE to follow jumps that conditionally skip over blocks. When
CSE encounters a simple <code class="verbatim">if</code> statement with no else clause,
<strong>-fcse-skip-blocks</strong> causes CSE to follow the jump around the body of
the <code class="verbatim">if</code>. Enabled at levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-frerun-cse-after-loop
</dt>
<dd>Re-run common subexpression elimination
after loop optimizations are performed. Enabled at levels <strong>-O2</strong>,
<strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fgcse
</dt>
<dd>Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass. This
pass also performs global constant and copy propagation. <em>Note:</em> When
compiling a program using computed gotos, a GCC extension, you may get
better run-time performance if you disable the global common
subexpression elimination pass by adding <strong>-fno-gcse</strong> to the command
line. Enabled at levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fgcse-lm
</dt>
<dd>When <strong>-fgcse-lm</strong> is enabled, global common subexpression
elimination attempts to move loads that are only killed by stores into
themselves. This allows a loop containing a load/store sequence to be
changed to a load outside the loop, and a copy/store within the loop.
Enabled by default when <strong>-fgcse</strong> is enabled.</dd>
<dt>
-fgcse-sm
</dt>
<dd>When <strong>-fgcse-sm</strong> is enabled, a store motion pass is run
after global common subexpression elimination. This pass attempts to
move stores out of loops. When used in conjunction with <strong>-fgcse-lm</strong>,
loops containing a load/store sequence can be changed to a load before
the loop and a store after the loop. Not enabled at any optimization
level.</dd>
<dt>
-fgcse-las
</dt>
<dd>When <strong>-fgcse-las</strong> is enabled, the global common
subexpression elimination pass eliminates redundant loads that come
after stores to the same memory location (both partial and full
redundancies). Not enabled at any optimization level.</dd>
<dt>
-fgcse-after-reload
</dt>
<dd>When <strong>-fgcse-after-reload</strong> is enabled, a
redundant load elimination pass is performed after reload. The purpose
of this pass is to clean up redundant spilling. Enabled by <strong>-O3</strong>,
<strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and <strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-faggressive-loop-optimizations
</dt>
<dd>This option tells the loop
optimizer to use language constraints to derive bounds for the number
of iterations of a loop. This assumes that loop code does not invoke
undefined behavior by for example causing signed integer overflows or
out-of-bound array accesses. The bounds for the number of iterations
of a loop are used to guide loop unrolling and peeling and loop exit
test optimizations. This option is enabled by default.</dd>
<dt>
-funconstrained-commons
</dt>
<dd>This option tells the compiler that
variables declared in common blocks (e.g. Fortran) may later be
overridden with longer trailing arrays. This prevents certain
optimizations that depend on knowing the array bounds.</dd>
<dt>
-fcrossjumping
</dt>
<dd>Perform cross-jumping transformation. This
transformation unifies equivalent code and saves code size. The
resulting code may or may not perform better than without
cross-jumping. Enabled at levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fauto-inc-dec
</dt>
<dd>Combine increments or decrements of addresses with
memory accesses. This pass is always skipped on architectures that do
not have instructions to support this. Enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and
higher on architectures that support this.</dd>
<dt>
-fdce
</dt>
<dd>Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on RTL. Enabled by
default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fdse
</dt>
<dd>Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on RTL. Enabled by
default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fif-conversion
</dt>
<dd>Attempt to transform conditional jumps into
branch-less equivalents. This includes use of conditional moves, min,
max, set flags and abs instructions, and some tricks doable by
standard arithmetics. The use of conditional execution on chips where
it is available is controlled by <strong>-fif-conversion2</strong>. Enabled at levels
<strong>-O1</strong>, <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>, but not with <strong>-Og</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fif-conversion2
</dt>
<dd>Use conditional execution (where available) to
transform conditional jumps into branch-less equivalents. Enabled at
levels <strong>-O1</strong>, <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>, but not with <strong>-Og</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fdeclone-ctor-dtor
</dt>
<dd>The C++ ABI requires multiple entry points for
constructors and destructors: one for a base subobject, one for a
complete object, and one for a virtual destructor that calls operator
delete afterwards. For a hierarchy with virtual bases, the base and
complete variants are clones, which means two copies of the function.
With this option, the base and complete variants are changed to be
thunks that call a common implementation. Enabled by <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fdelete-null-pointer-checks
</dt>
<dd>Assume that programs cannot safely
dereference null pointers, and that no code or data element resides at
address zero. This option enables simple constant folding
optimizations at all optimization levels. In addition, other
optimization passes in GCC use this flag to control global dataflow
analyses that eliminate useless checks for null pointers; these assume
that a memory access to address zero always results in a trap, so that
if a pointer is checked after it has already been dereferenced, it
cannot be null. Note however that in some environments this assumption
is not true. Use <strong>-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks</strong> to disable this
optimization for programs that depend on that behavior. This option is
enabled by default on most targets. On Nios II ELF, it defaults to
off. On AVR and MSP430, this option is completely disabled. Passes
that use the dataflow information are enabled independently at
different optimization levels.</dd>
<dt>
-fdevirtualize
</dt>
<dd>Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to
direct calls. This is done both within a procedure and
interprocedurally as part of indirect inlining (<strong>-findirect-inlining</strong>)
and interprocedural constant propagation (<strong>-fipa-cp</strong>). Enabled at
levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fdevirtualize-speculatively
</dt>
<dd>Attempt to convert calls to virtual
functions to speculative direct calls. Based on the analysis of the
type inheritance graph, determine for a given call the set of likely
targets. If the set is small, preferably of size 1, change the call
into a conditional deciding between direct and indirect calls. The
speculative calls enable more optimizations, such as inlining. When
they seem useless after further optimization, they are converted back
into original form.</dd>
<dt>
-fdevirtualize-at-ltrans
</dt>
<dd>Stream extra information needed for
aggressive devirtualization when running the link-time optimizer in
local transformation mode. This option enables more devirtualization
but significantly increases the size of streamed data. For this reason
it is disabled by default.</dd>
<dt>
-fexpensive-optimizations
</dt>
<dd>Perform a number of minor optimizations
that are relatively expensive. Enabled at levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-free
</dt>
<dd>Attempt to remove redundant extension instructions. This is
especially helpful for the x86-64 architecture, which implicitly
zero-extends in 64-bit registers after writing to their lower 32-bit
half. Enabled for Alpha, AArch64 and x86 at levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>,
<strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-lifetime-dse
</dt>
<dd>In C++ the value of an object is only affected by
changes within its lifetime: when the constructor begins, the object
has an indeterminate value, and any changes during the lifetime of the
object are dead when the object is destroyed. Normally dead store
elimination will take advantage of this; if your code relies on the
value of the object storage persisting beyond the lifetime of the
object, you can use this flag to disable this optimization. To
preserve stores before the constructor starts (e.g. because your
operator new clears the object storage) but still treat the object as
dead after the destructor, you can use <strong>-flifetime-dse=1</strong>. The default
behavior can be explicitly selected with <strong>-flifetime-dse=2</strong>.
<strong>-flifetime-dse=0</strong> is equivalent to <strong>-fno-lifetime-dse</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-flive-range-shrinkage
</dt>
<dd>Attempt to decrease register pressure
through register live range shrinkage. This is helpful for fast
processors with small or moderate size register sets.</dd>
<dt>
-fira-algorithm=algorithm
</dt>
<dd>Use the specified coloring algorithm for
the integrated register allocator. The <em>algorithm</em> argument can be
<strong>priority</strong>, which specifies Chow&#39;s priority coloring, or <strong>CB</strong>, which
specifies Chaitin-Briggs coloring. Chaitin-Briggs coloring is not
implemented for all architectures, but for those targets that do
support it, it is the default because it generates better code.</dd>
<dt>
-fira-region=region
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use specified regions for the integrated
register allocator. The <em>region</em> argument should be one of the
following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
all
</dt>
<dd>Use all loops as register allocation regions. This can give
the best results for machines with a small and/or irregular register
set.</dd>
<dt>
mixed
</dt>
<dd>Use all loops except for loops with small register pressure
as the regions. This value usually gives the best results in most
cases and for most architectures, and is enabled by default when
compiling with optimization for speed (<strong>-O</strong>, <strong>-O2</strong>, …).</dd>
<dt>
one
</dt>
<dd>Use all functions as a single region. This typically results
in the smallest code size, and is enabled by default for <strong>-Os</strong> or
<strong>-O0</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
-fira-hoist-pressure
</dt>
<dd>Use IRA to evaluate register pressure in the
code hoisting pass for decisions to hoist expressions. This option
usually results in smaller code, but it can slow the compiler down.
This option is enabled at level <strong>-Os</strong> for all targets.</dd>
<dt>
-fira-loop-pressure
</dt>
<dd>Use IRA to evaluate register pressure in loops
for decisions to move loop invariants. This option usually results in
generation of faster and smaller code on machines with large register
files (&gt;= 32 registers), but it can slow the compiler down. This
option is enabled at level <strong>-O3</strong> for some targets.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-ira-share-save-slots
</dt>
<dd>Disable sharing of stack slots used for
saving call-used hard registers living through a call. Each hard
register gets a separate stack slot, and as a result function stack
frames are larger.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-ira-share-spill-slots
</dt>
<dd>Disable sharing of stack slots allocated
for pseudo-registers. Each pseudo-register that does not get a hard
register gets a separate stack slot, and as a result function stack
frames are larger.</dd>
<dt>
-flra-remat
</dt>
<dd>Enable CFG-sensitive rematerialization in LRA. Instead
of loading values of spilled pseudos, LRA tries to rematerialize
(recalculate) values if it is profitable. Enabled at levels <strong>-O2</strong>,
<strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fdelayed-branch
</dt>
<dd>If supported for the target machine, attempt to
reorder instructions to exploit instruction slots available after
delayed branch instructions. Enabled at levels <strong>-O1</strong>, <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>,
<strong>-Os</strong>, but not at <strong>-Og</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fschedule-insns
</dt>
<dd>If supported for the target machine, attempt to
reorder instructions to eliminate execution stalls due to required
data being unavailable. This helps machines that have slow floating
point or memory load instructions by allowing other instructions to be
issued until the result of the load or floating-point instruction is
required. Enabled at levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fschedule-insns2
</dt>
<dd>Similar to <strong>-fschedule-insns</strong>, but requests an
additional pass of instruction scheduling after register allocation
has been done. This is especially useful on machines with a relatively
small number of registers and where memory load instructions take more
than one cycle. Enabled at levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-sched-interblock
</dt>
<dd>Disable instruction scheduling across basic
blocks, which is normally enabled when scheduling before register
allocation, i.e. with <strong>-fschedule-insns</strong> or at <strong>-O2</strong> or higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-sched-spec
</dt>
<dd>Disable speculative motion of non-load
instructions, which is normally enabled when scheduling before
register allocation, i.e. with <strong>-fschedule-insns</strong> or at <strong>-O2</strong> or
higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fsched-pressure
</dt>
<dd>Enable register pressure sensitive insn scheduling
before register allocation. This only makes sense when scheduling
before register allocation is enabled, i.e. with <strong>-fschedule-insns</strong> or
at <strong>-O2</strong> or higher. Usage of this option can improve the generated
code and decrease its size by preventing register pressure increase
above the number of available hard registers and subsequent spills in
register allocation.</dd>
<dt>
-fsched-spec-load
</dt>
<dd>Allow speculative motion of some load
instructions. This only makes sense when scheduling before register
allocation, i.e. with <strong>-fschedule-insns</strong> or at <strong>-O2</strong> or higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fsched-spec-load-dangerous
</dt>
<dd>Allow speculative motion of more load
instructions. This only makes sense when scheduling before register
allocation, i.e. with <strong>-fschedule-insns</strong> or at <strong>-O2</strong> or higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fsched-stalled-insns
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-fsched-stalled-insns=n
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Define how many insns (if any) can be moved prematurely from the queue
of stalled insns into the ready list during the second scheduling pass.
<strong>-fno-sched-stalled-insns</strong> means that no insns are moved prematurely,
<strong>-fsched-stalled-insns=0</strong> means there is no limit on how many queued
insns can be moved prematurely. <strong>-fsched-stalled-insns</strong> without a value
is equivalent to <strong>-fsched-stalled-insns=1</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-fsched-stalled-insns-dep
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=n
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Define how many insn groups (cycles) are examined for a dependency on a
stalled insn that is a candidate for premature removal from the queue of
stalled insns. This has an effect only during the second scheduling
pass, and only if <strong>-fsched-stalled-insns</strong> is used.
<strong>-fno-sched-stalled-insns-dep</strong> is equivalent to
<strong>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=0</strong>. <strong>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep</strong> without a
value is equivalent to <strong>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=1</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-fsched2-use-superblocks
</dt>
<dd>When scheduling after register allocation,
use superblock scheduling. This allows motion across basic block
boundaries, resulting in faster schedules. This option is
experimental, as not all machine descriptions used by GCC model the
CPU closely enough to avoid unreliable results from the algorithm.
This only makes sense when scheduling after register allocation, i.e.
with <strong>-fschedule-insns2</strong> or at <strong>-O2</strong> or higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fsched-group-heuristic
</dt>
<dd>Enable the group heuristic in the
scheduler. This heuristic favors the instruction that belongs to a
schedule group. This is enabled by default when scheduling is enabled,
i.e. with <strong>-fschedule-insns</strong> or <strong>-fschedule-insns2</strong> or at <strong>-O2</strong> or
higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fsched-critical-path-heuristic
</dt>
<dd>Enable the critical-path heuristic
in the scheduler. This heuristic favors instructions on the critical
path. This is enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. with
<strong>-fschedule-insns</strong> or <strong>-fschedule-insns2</strong> or at <strong>-O2</strong> or higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fsched-spec-insn-heuristic
</dt>
<dd>Enable the speculative instruction
heuristic in the scheduler. This heuristic favors speculative
instructions with greater dependency weakness. This is enabled by
default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. with <strong>-fschedule-insns</strong> or
<strong>-fschedule-insns2</strong> or at <strong>-O2</strong> or higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fsched-rank-heuristic
</dt>
<dd>Enable the rank heuristic in the scheduler.
This heuristic favors the instruction belonging to a basic block with
greater size or frequency. This is enabled by default when scheduling
is enabled, i.e. with <strong>-fschedule-insns</strong> or <strong>-fschedule-insns2</strong> or at
<strong>-O2</strong> or higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fsched-last-insn-heuristic
</dt>
<dd>Enable the last-instruction heuristic
in the scheduler. This heuristic favors the instruction that is less
dependent on the last instruction scheduled. This is enabled by
default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. with <strong>-fschedule-insns</strong> or
<strong>-fschedule-insns2</strong> or at <strong>-O2</strong> or higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fsched-dep-count-heuristic
</dt>
<dd>Enable the dependent-count heuristic in
the scheduler. This heuristic favors the instruction that has more
instructions depending on it. This is enabled by default when
scheduling is enabled, i.e. with <strong>-fschedule-insns</strong> or
<strong>-fschedule-insns2</strong> or at <strong>-O2</strong> or higher.</dd>
<dt>
-freschedule-modulo-scheduled-loops
</dt>
<dd>Modulo scheduling is performed
before traditional scheduling. If a loop is modulo scheduled, later
scheduling passes may change its schedule. Use this option to control
that behavior.</dd>
<dt>
-fselective-scheduling
</dt>
<dd>Schedule instructions using selective
scheduling algorithm. Selective scheduling runs instead of the first
scheduler pass.</dd>
<dt>
-fselective-scheduling2
</dt>
<dd>Schedule instructions using selective
scheduling algorithm. Selective scheduling runs instead of the second
scheduler pass.</dd>
<dt>
-fsel-sched-pipelining
</dt>
<dd>Enable software pipelining of innermost
loops during selective scheduling. This option has no effect unless
one of <strong>-fselective-scheduling</strong> or <strong>-fselective-scheduling2</strong> is turned
on.</dd>
<dt>
-fsel-sched-pipelining-outer-loops
</dt>
<dd>When pipelining loops during
selective scheduling, also pipeline outer loops. This option has no
effect unless <strong>-fsel-sched-pipelining</strong> is turned on.</dd>
<dt>
-fsemantic-interposition
</dt>
<dd>Some object formats, like ELF, allow
interposing of symbols by the dynamic linker. This means that for
symbols exported from the DSO, the compiler cannot perform
interprocedural propagation, inlining and other optimizations in
anticipation that the function or variable in question may change.
While this feature is useful, for example, to rewrite memory
allocation functions by a debugging implementation, it is expensive in
the terms of code quality. With <strong>-fno-semantic-interposition</strong> the
compiler assumes that if interposition happens for functions the
overwriting function will have precisely the same semantics (and side
effects). Similarly if interposition happens for variables, the
constructor of the variable will be the same. The flag has no effect
for functions explicitly declared inline (where it is never allowed
for interposition to change semantics) and for symbols explicitly
declared weak.</dd>
<dt>
-fshrink-wrap
</dt>
<dd>Emit function prologues only before parts of the
function that need it, rather than at the top of the function. This
flag is enabled by default at <strong>-O</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fshrink-wrap-separate
</dt>
<dd>Shrink-wrap separate parts of the prologue
and epilogue separately, so that those parts are only executed when
needed. This option is on by default, but has no effect unless
<strong>-fshrink-wrap</strong> is also turned on and the target supports this.</dd>
<dt>
-fcaller-saves
</dt>
<dd>Enable allocation of values to registers that are
clobbered by function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save
and restore the registers around such calls. Such allocation is done
only when it seems to result in better code. This option is always
enabled by default on certain machines, usually those which have no
call-preserved registers to use instead. Enabled at levels <strong>-O2</strong>,
<strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fcombine-stack-adjustments
</dt>
<dd>Tracks stack adjustments (pushes and
pops) and stack memory references and then tries to find ways to
combine them. Enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fipa-ra
</dt>
<dd>Use caller save registers for allocation if those
registers are not used by any called function. In that case it is not
necessary to save and restore them around calls. This is only possible
if called functions are part of same compilation unit as current
function and they are compiled before it. Enabled at levels <strong>-O2</strong>,
<strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>, however the option is disabled if generated code will be
instrumented for profiling (<strong>-p</strong>, or <strong>-pg</strong>) or if callee&#39;s register
usage cannot be known exactly (this happens on targets that do not
expose prologues and epilogues in RTL).</dd>
<dt>
-fconserve-stack
</dt>
<dd>Attempt to minimize stack usage. The compiler
attempts to use less stack space, even if that makes the program
slower. This option implies setting the <strong>large-stack-frame</strong> parameter
to 100 and the <strong>large-stack-frame-growth</strong> parameter to 400.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-reassoc
</dt>
<dd>Perform reassociation on trees. This flag is enabled
by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fcode-hoisting
</dt>
<dd>Perform code hoisting. Code hoisting tries to move
the evaluation of expressions executed on all paths to the function
exit as early as possible. This is especially useful as a code size
optimization, but it often helps for code speed as well. This flag is
enabled by default at <strong>-O2</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-pre
</dt>
<dd>Perform partial redundancy elimination (PRE) on trees.
This flag is enabled by default at <strong>-O2</strong> and <strong>-O3</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-partial-pre
</dt>
<dd>Make partial redundancy elimination (PRE) more
aggressive. This flag is enabled by default at <strong>-O3</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-forwprop
</dt>
<dd>Perform forward propagation on trees. This flag is
enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-fre
</dt>
<dd>Perform full redundancy elimination (FRE) on trees. The
difference between FRE and PRE is that FRE only considers expressions
that are computed on all paths leading to the redundant computation.
This analysis is faster than PRE, though it exposes fewer
redundancies. This flag is enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-phiprop
</dt>
<dd>Perform hoisting of loads from conditional pointers
on trees. This pass is enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fhoist-adjacent-loads
</dt>
<dd>Speculatively hoist loads from both branches
of an if-then-else if the loads are from adjacent locations in the
same structure and the target architecture has a conditional move
instruction. This flag is enabled by default at <strong>-O2</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-copy-prop
</dt>
<dd>Perform copy propagation on trees. This pass
eliminates unnecessary copy operations. This flag is enabled by
default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fipa-pure-const
</dt>
<dd>Discover which functions are pure or constant.
Enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fipa-reference
</dt>
<dd>Discover which static variables do not escape the
compilation unit. Enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fipa-reference-addressable
</dt>
<dd>Discover read-only, write-only and
non-addressable static variables. Enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and
higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fipa-stack-alignment
</dt>
<dd>Reduce stack alignment on call sites if
possible. Enabled by default.</dd>
<dt>
-fipa-pta
</dt>
<dd>Perform interprocedural pointer analysis and
interprocedural modification and reference analysis. This option can
cause excessive memory and compile-time usage on large compilation
units. It is not enabled by default at any optimization level.</dd>
<dt>
-fipa-profile
</dt>
<dd>Perform interprocedural profile propagation. The
functions called only from cold functions are marked as cold. Also
functions executed once (such as <code class="verbatim">cold</code>, <code class="verbatim">noreturn</code>, static
constructors or destructors) are identified. Cold functions and loop
less parts of functions executed once are then optimized for size.
Enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fipa-modref
</dt>
<dd>Perform interprocedural mod/ref analysis. This
optimization analyzes the side effects of functions (memory locations
that are modified or referenced) and enables better optimization
across the function call boundary. This flag is enabled by default at
<strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fipa-cp
</dt>
<dd>Perform interprocedural constant propagation. This
optimization analyzes the program to determine when values passed to
functions are constants and then optimizes accordingly. This
optimization can substantially increase performance if the application
has constants passed to functions. This flag is enabled by default at
<strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong> and <strong>-O3</strong>. It is also enabled by <strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and
<strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fipa-cp-clone
</dt>
<dd>Perform function cloning to make interprocedural
constant propagation stronger. When enabled, interprocedural constant
propagation performs function cloning when externally visible function
can be called with constant arguments. Because this optimization can
create multiple copies of functions, it may significantly increase
code size (see <strong>–param ipa-cp-unit-growth=*/value/). This flag is
enabled by default at *-O3</strong>. It is also enabled by <strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and
<strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fipa-bit-cp
</dt>
<dd>When enabled, perform interprocedural bitwise constant
propagation. This flag is enabled by default at <strong>-O2</strong> and by
<strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and <strong>-fauto-profile</strong>. It requires that <strong>-fipa-cp</strong> is
enabled.</dd>
<dt>
-fipa-vrp
</dt>
<dd>When enabled, perform interprocedural propagation of
value ranges. This flag is enabled by default at <strong>-O2</strong>. It requires
that <strong>-fipa-cp</strong> is enabled.</dd>
<dt>
-fipa-icf
</dt>
<dd>Perform Identical Code Folding for functions and
read-only variables. The optimization reduces code size and may
disturb unwind stacks by replacing a function by equivalent one with a
different name. The optimization works more effectively with link-time
optimization enabled. Although the behavior is similar to the Gold
Linker&#39;s ICF optimization, GCC ICF works on different levels and thus
the optimizations are not same - there are equivalences that are found
only by GCC and equivalences found only by Gold. This flag is enabled
by default at <strong>-O2</strong> and <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-flive-patching=level
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Control GCC&#39;s optimizations to produce output
suitable for live-patching. If the compiler&#39;s optimization uses a
function&#39;s body or information extracted from its body to
optimize/change another function, the latter is called an impacted
function of the former. If a function is patched, its impacted
functions should be patched too. The impacted functions are determined
by the compiler&#39;s interprocedural optimizations. For example, a caller
is impacted when inlining a function into its caller, cloning a
function and changing its caller to call this new clone, or extracting
a function&#39;s pureness/constness information to optimize its direct or
indirect callers, etc. Usually, the more IPA optimizations enabled,
the larger the number of impacted functions for each function. In
order to control the number of impacted functions and more easily
compute the list of impacted function, IPA optimizations can be
partially enabled at two different levels. The <em>level</em> argument should
be one of the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
inline-clone
</dt>
<dd>Only enable inlining and cloning optimizations,
which includes inlining, cloning, interprocedural scalar replacement
of aggregates and partial inlining. As a result, when patching a
function, all its callers and its clones&#39; callers are impacted,
therefore need to be patched as well. <strong>-flive-patching=inline-clone</strong>
disables the following optimization flags: <strong>-fwhole-program
-fipa-pta -fipa-reference -fipa-ra</strong> -fipa-icf -fipa-icf-functions
-fipa-icf-variables -fipa-bit-cp -fipa-vrp -fipa-pure-const
-fipa-reference-addressable -fipa-stack-alignment -fipa-modref</dd>
<dt>
inline-only-static
</dt>
<dd>Only enable inlining of static functions. As a
result, when patching a static function, all its callers are
impacted and so need to be patched as well. In addition to all the
flags that <strong>-flive-patching=inline-clone</strong> disables,
<strong>-flive-patching=inline-only-static</strong> disables the following
additional optimization flags: <strong>-fipa-cp-clone -fipa-sra
-fpartial-inlining -fipa-cp</strong></dd>
</dl>
<p>When <strong>-flive-patching</strong> is specified without any value, the default
value is <em>inline-clone</em>. This flag is disabled by default. Note that
<strong>-flive-patching</strong> is not supported with link-time optimization
(<strong>-flto</strong>).</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-fisolate-erroneous-paths-dereference
</dt>
<dd>Detect paths that trigger
erroneous or undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer.
Isolate those paths from the main control flow and turn the statement
with erroneous or undefined behavior into a trap. This flag is enabled
by default at <strong>-O2</strong> and higher and depends on
<strong>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</strong> also being enabled.</dd>
<dt>
-fisolate-erroneous-paths-attribute
</dt>
<dd>Detect paths that trigger
erroneous or undefined behavior due to a null value being used in a
way forbidden by a <code class="verbatim">returns_nonnull</code> or <code class="verbatim">nonnull</code> attribute. Isolate
those paths from the main control flow and turn the statement with
erroneous or undefined behavior into a trap. This is not currently
enabled, but may be enabled by <strong>-O2</strong> in the future.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-sink
</dt>
<dd>Perform forward store motion on trees. This flag is
enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-bit-ccp
</dt>
<dd>Perform sparse conditional bit constant propagation
on trees and propagate pointer alignment information. This pass only
operates on local scalar variables and is enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong>
and higher, except for <strong>-Og</strong>. It requires that <strong>-ftree-ccp</strong> is
enabled.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-ccp
</dt>
<dd>Perform sparse conditional constant propagation (CCP) on
trees. This pass only operates on local scalar variables and is
enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fssa-backprop
</dt>
<dd>Propagate information about uses of a value up the
definition chain in order to simplify the definitions. For example,
this pass strips sign operations if the sign of a value never matters.
The flag is enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fssa-phiopt
</dt>
<dd>Perform pattern matching on SSA PHI nodes to optimize
conditional code. This pass is enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher,
except for <strong>-Og</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-switch-conversion
</dt>
<dd>Perform conversion of simple
initializations in a switch to initializations from a scalar array.
This flag is enabled by default at <strong>-O2</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-tail-merge
</dt>
<dd>Look for identical code sequences. When found,
replace one with a jump to the other. This optimization is known as
tail merging or cross jumping. This flag is enabled by default at
<strong>-O2</strong> and higher. The compilation time in this pass can be limited
using <strong>max-tail-merge-comparisons</strong> parameter and
<strong>max-tail-merge-iterations</strong> parameter.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-dce
</dt>
<dd>Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on trees. This flag
is enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-builtin-call-dce
</dt>
<dd>Perform conditional dead code elimination
(DCE) for calls to built-in functions that may set <code class="verbatim">errno</code> but are
otherwise free of side effects. This flag is enabled by default at
<strong>-O2</strong> and higher if <strong>-Os</strong> is not also specified.</dd>
<dt>
-ffinite-loops
</dt>
<dd>Assume that a loop with an exit will eventually take
the exit and not loop indefinitely. This allows the compiler to remove
loops that otherwise have no side-effects, not considering eventual
endless looping as such. This option is enabled by default at <strong>-O2</strong>
for C++ with -std=c++11 or higher.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-dominator-opts
</dt>
<dd>Perform a variety of simple scalar cleanups
(constant/copy propagation, redundancy elimination, range propagation
and expression simplification) based on a dominator tree traversal.
This also performs jump threading (to reduce jumps to jumps). This
flag is enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-dse
</dt>
<dd>Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on trees. A dead
store is a store into a memory location that is later overwritten by
another store without any intervening loads. In this case the earlier
store can be deleted. This flag is enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and
higher.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-ch
</dt>
<dd>Perform loop header copying on trees. This is beneficial
since it increases effectiveness of code motion optimizations. It also
saves one jump. This flag is enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.
It is not enabled for <strong>-Os</strong>, since it usually increases code size.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-loop-optimize
</dt>
<dd>Perform loop optimizations on trees. This flag
is enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-loop-linear
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-floop-strip-mine
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-floop-block
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Perform loop nest optimizations. Same as <strong>-floop-nest-optimize</strong>. To use
this code transformation, GCC has to be configured with <strong>–with-isl</strong> to
enable the Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-fgraphite-identity
</dt>
<dd>Enable the identity transformation for
graphite. For every SCoP we generate the polyhedral representation and
transform it back to gimple. Using <strong>-fgraphite-identity</strong> we can check
the costs or benefits of the GIMPLE -&gt; GRAPHITE -&gt; GIMPLE
transformation. Some minimal optimizations are also performed by the
code generator isl, like index splitting and dead code elimination in
loops.</dd>
<dt>
-floop-nest-optimize
</dt>
<dd>Enable the isl based loop nest optimizer. This
is a generic loop nest optimizer based on the Pluto optimization
algorithms. It calculates a loop structure optimized for data-locality
and parallelism. This option is experimental.</dd>
<dt>
-floop-parallelize-all
</dt>
<dd>Use the Graphite data dependence analysis to
identify loops that can be parallelized. Parallelize all the loops
that can be analyzed to not contain loop carried dependences without
checking that it is profitable to parallelize the loops.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-coalesce-vars
</dt>
<dd>While transforming the program out of the SSA
representation, attempt to reduce copying by coalescing versions of
different user-defined variables, instead of just compiler
temporaries. This may severely limit the ability to debug an optimized
program compiled with <strong>-fno-var-tracking-assignments</strong>. In the negated
form, this flag prevents SSA coalescing of user variables. This option
is enabled by default if optimization is enabled, and it does very
little otherwise.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-loop-if-convert
</dt>
<dd>Attempt to transform conditional jumps in
the innermost loops to branch-less equivalents. The intent is to
remove control-flow from the innermost loops in order to improve the
ability of the vectorization pass to handle these loops. This is
enabled by default if vectorization is enabled.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-loop-distribution
</dt>
<dd>Perform loop distribution. This flag can
improve cache performance on big loop bodies and allow further loop
optimizations, like parallelization or vectorization, to take place.
For example, the loop DO I = 1, N A(I) = B(I) + C D(I) = E(I) * F
ENDDO is transformed to DO I = 1, N A(I) = B(I) + C ENDDO DO I = 1, N
D(I) = E(I) * F ENDDO This flag is enabled by default at <strong>-O3</strong>. It is
also enabled by <strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and <strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-loop-distribute-patterns
</dt>
<dd>Perform loop distribution of
patterns that can be code generated with calls to a library. This flag
is enabled by default at <strong>-O2</strong> and higher, and by <strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and
<strong>-fauto-profile</strong>. This pass distributes the initialization loops and
generates a call to memset zero. For example, the loop DO I = 1, N
A(I) = 0 B(I) = A(I) + I ENDDO is transformed to DO I = 1, N A(I) = 0
ENDDO DO I = 1, N B(I) = A(I) + I ENDDO and the initialization loop is
transformed into a call to memset zero. This flag is enabled by
default at <strong>-O3</strong>. It is also enabled by <strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and
<strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-floop-interchange
</dt>
<dd>Perform loop interchange outside of graphite.
This flag can improve cache performance on loop nest and allow further
loop optimizations, like vectorization, to take place. For example,
the loop for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) for (int j = 0; j &lt; N; j++) for
(int k = 0; k &lt; N; k++) c[i][j] = c[i][j] + a[i][k]*b[k][j]; is
transformed to for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) for (int k = 0; k &lt; N; k++)
for (int j = 0; j &lt; N; j++) c[i][j] = c[i][j] + a[i][k]*b[k][j]; This
flag is enabled by default at <strong>-O3</strong>. It is also enabled by
<strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and <strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-floop-unroll-and-jam
</dt>
<dd>Apply unroll and jam transformations on
feasible loops. In a loop nest this unrolls the outer loop by some
factor and fuses the resulting multiple inner loops. This flag is
enabled by default at <strong>-O3</strong>. It is also enabled by <strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and
<strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-loop-im
</dt>
<dd>Perform loop invariant motion on trees. This pass
moves only invariants that are hard to handle at RTL level (function
calls, operations that expand to nontrivial sequences of insns). With
<strong>-funswitch-loops</strong> it also moves operands of conditions that are
invariant out of the loop, so that we can use just trivial
invariantness analysis in loop unswitching. The pass also includes
store motion.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-loop-ivcanon
</dt>
<dd>Create a canonical counter for number of
iterations in loops for which determining number of iterations
requires complicated analysis. Later optimizations then may determine
the number easily. Useful especially in connection with unrolling.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-scev-cprop
</dt>
<dd>Perform final value replacement. If a variable is
modified in a loop in such a way that its value when exiting the loop
can be determined using only its initial value and the number of loop
iterations, replace uses of the final value by such a computation,
provided it is sufficiently cheap. This reduces data dependencies and
may allow further simplifications. Enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and
higher.</dd>
<dt>
-fivopts
</dt>
<dd>Perform induction variable optimizations (strength
reduction, induction variable merging and induction variable
elimination) on trees.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-parallelize-loops=n
</dt>
<dd>Parallelize loops, i.e., split their
iteration space to run in n threads. This is only possible for loops
whose iterations are independent and can be arbitrarily reordered. The
optimization is only profitable on multiprocessor machines, for loops
that are CPU-intensive, rather than constrained e.g. by memory
bandwidth. This option implies <strong>-pthread</strong>, and thus is only supported
on targets that have support for <strong>-pthread</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-pta
</dt>
<dd>Perform function-local points-to analysis on trees. This
flag is enabled by default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher, except for <strong>-Og</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-sra
</dt>
<dd>Perform scalar replacement of aggregates. This pass
replaces structure references with scalars to prevent committing
structures to memory too early. This flag is enabled by default at
<strong>-O1</strong> and higher, except for <strong>-Og</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fstore-merging
</dt>
<dd>Perform merging of narrow stores to consecutive
memory addresses. This pass merges contiguous stores of immediate
values narrower than a word into fewer wider stores to reduce the
number of instructions. This is enabled by default at <strong>-O2</strong> and higher
as well as <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-ter
</dt>
<dd>Perform temporary expression replacement during the
SSA-&gt;normal phase. Single use/single def temporaries are replaced at
their use location with their defining expression. This results in
non-GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders much more complex trees to
work on resulting in better RTL generation. This is enabled by default
at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-slsr
</dt>
<dd>Perform straight-line strength reduction on trees. This
recognizes related expressions involving multiplications and replaces
them by less expensive calculations when possible. This is enabled by
default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-vectorize
</dt>
<dd>Perform vectorization on trees. This flag enables
<strong>-ftree-loop-vectorize</strong> and <strong>-ftree-slp-vectorize</strong> if not explicitly
specified.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-loop-vectorize
</dt>
<dd>Perform loop vectorization on trees. This
flag is enabled by default at <strong>-O2</strong> and by <strong>-ftree-vectorize</strong>,
<strong>-fprofile-use</strong>, and <strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-slp-vectorize
</dt>
<dd>Perform basic block vectorization on trees.
This flag is enabled by default at <strong>-O2</strong> and by <strong>-ftree-vectorize</strong>,
<strong>-fprofile-use</strong>, and <strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-ftrivial-auto-var-init=choice
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Initialize automatic variables with
either a pattern or with zeroes to increase the security and
predictability of a program by preventing uninitialized memory
disclosure and use. GCC still considers an automatic variable that
doesn&#39;t have an explicit initializer as uninitialized,
<strong>-Wuninitialized</strong> and <strong>-Wanalyzer-use-of-uninitialized-value</strong> will
still report warning messages on such automatic variables and the
compiler will perform optimization as if the variable were
uninitialized. With this option, GCC will also initialize any padding
of automatic variables that have structure or union types to zeroes.
However, the current implementation cannot initialize automatic
variables that are declared between the controlling expression and the
first case of a <code class="verbatim">switch</code> statement. Using <strong>-Wtrivial-auto-var-init</strong> to
report all such cases. The three values of <em>choice</em> are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>uninitialized</strong> doesn&#39;t initialize any automatic variables. This is
C and C++&#39;s default.</li>
<li><strong>pattern</strong> Initialize automatic variables with values which will
likely transform logic bugs into crashes down the line, are easily
recognized in a crash dump and without being values that programmers
can rely on for useful program semantics. The current value is
byte-repeatable pattern with byte &#34;0xFE&#34;. The values used for
pattern initialization might be changed in the future.</li>
<li><strong>zero</strong> Initialize automatic variables with zeroes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default is <strong>uninitialized</strong>. You can control this behavior for a
specific variable by using the variable attribute <code class="verbatim">uninitialized</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-fvect-cost-model=model
</dt>
<dd>Alter the cost model used for
vectorization. The <em>model</em> argument should be one of <strong>unlimited</strong>,
<strong>dynamic</strong>, <strong>cheap</strong> or <strong>very-cheap</strong>. With the <strong>unlimited</strong> model the
vectorized code-path is assumed to be profitable while with the
<strong>dynamic</strong> model a runtime check guards the vectorized code-path to
enable it only for iteration counts that will likely execute faster
than when executing the original scalar loop. The <strong>cheap</strong> model
disables vectorization of loops where doing so would be cost
prohibitive for example due to required runtime checks for data
dependence or alignment but otherwise is equal to the <strong>dynamic</strong> model.
The <strong>very-cheap</strong> model only allows vectorization if the vector code
would entirely replace the scalar code that is being vectorized. For
example, if each iteration of a vectorized loop would only be able to
handle exactly four iterations of the scalar loop, the <strong>very-cheap</strong>
model would only allow vectorization if the scalar iteration count is
known to be a multiple of four. The default cost model depends on
other optimization flags and is either <strong>dynamic</strong> or <strong>cheap</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fsimd-cost-model=model
</dt>
<dd>Alter the cost model used for vectorization
of loops marked with the OpenMP simd directive. The <em>model</em> argument
should be one of <strong>unlimited</strong>, <strong>dynamic</strong>, <strong>cheap</strong>. All values of
<em>model</em> have the same meaning as described in <strong>-fvect-cost-model</strong> and
by default a cost model defined with <strong>-fvect-cost-model</strong> is used.</dd>
<dt>
-ftree-vrp
</dt>
<dd>Perform Value Range Propagation on trees. This is
similar to the constant propagation pass, but instead of values,
ranges of values are propagated. This allows the optimizers to remove
unnecessary range checks like array bound checks and null pointer
checks. This is enabled by default at <strong>-O2</strong> and higher. Null pointer
check elimination is only done if <strong>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</strong> is
enabled.</dd>
<dt>
-fsplit-paths
</dt>
<dd>Split paths leading to loop backedges. This can
improve dead code elimination and common subexpression elimination.
This is enabled by default at <strong>-O3</strong> and above.</dd>
<dt>
-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller
</dt>
<dd>Enables expression of values of induction
variables in later iterations of the unrolled loop using the value in
the first iteration. This breaks long dependency chains, thus
improving efficiency of the scheduling passes. A combination of
<strong>-fweb</strong> and CSE is often sufficient to obtain the same effect.
However, that is not reliable in cases where the loop body is more
complicated than a single basic block. It also does not work at all on
some architectures due to restrictions in the CSE pass. This
optimization is enabled by default.</dd>
<dt>
-fvariable-expansion-in-unroller
</dt>
<dd>With this option, the compiler
creates multiple copies of some local variables when unrolling a loop,
which can result in superior code. This optimization is enabled by
default for PowerPC targets, but disabled by default otherwise.</dd>
<dt>
-fpartial-inlining
</dt>
<dd>Inline parts of functions. This option has any
effect only when inlining itself is turned on by the
<strong>-finline-functions</strong> or <strong>-finline-small-functions</strong> options. Enabled at
levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fpredictive-commoning
</dt>
<dd>Perform predictive commoning optimization,
i.e., reusing computations (especially memory loads and stores)
performed in previous iterations of loops. This option is enabled at
level <strong>-O3</strong>. It is also enabled by <strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and
<strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fprefetch-loop-arrays
</dt>
<dd>If supported by the target machine, generate
instructions to prefetch memory to improve the performance of loops
that access large arrays. This option may generate better or worse
code; results are highly dependent on the structure of loops within
the source code. Disabled at level <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-printf-return-value
</dt>
<dd>Do not substitute constants for known
return value of formatted output functions such as <code class="verbatim">sprintf</code>,
<code class="verbatim">snprintf</code>, <code class="verbatim">vsprintf</code>, and <code class="verbatim">vsnprintf</code> (but not <code class="verbatim">printf</code> of
<code class="verbatim">fprintf</code>). This transformation allows GCC to optimize or even
eliminate branches based on the known return value of these functions
called with arguments that are either constant, or whose values are
known to be in a range that makes determining the exact return value
possible. For example, when <strong>-fprintf-return-value</strong> is in effect, both
the branch and the body of the <code class="verbatim">if</code> statement (but not the call to
<code class="verbatim">snprint</code>) can be optimized away when <code class="verbatim">i</code> is a 32-bit or smaller
integer because the return value is guaranteed to be at most 8. char
buf[9]; if (snprintf (buf, &#34;%08x&#34;, i) &gt;= sizeof buf) … The
<strong>-fprintf-return-value</strong> option relies on other optimizations and
yields best results with <strong>-O2</strong> and above. It works in tandem with the
<strong>-Wformat-overflow</strong> and <strong>-Wformat-truncation</strong> options. The
<strong>-fprintf-return-value</strong> option is enabled by default.</dd>
<dt>

</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-fno-peephole2
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations. The difference
between <strong>-fno-peephole</strong> and <strong>-fno-peephole2</strong> is in how they are
implemented in the compiler; some targets use one, some use the other, a
few use both. <strong>-fpeephole</strong> is enabled by default. <strong>-fpeephole2</strong> enabled
at levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-fno-guess-branch-probability
</dt>
<dd>Do not guess branch probabilities
using heuristics. GCC uses heuristics to guess branch probabilities if
they are not provided by profiling feedback (<strong>-fprofile-arcs</strong>). These
heuristics are based on the control flow graph. If some branch
probabilities are specified by <code class="verbatim">_ _builtin_expect</code>, then the
heuristics are used to guess branch probabilities for the rest of the
control flow graph, taking the <code class="verbatim">_ _builtin_expect</code> info into account.
The interactions between the heuristics and <code class="verbatim">_ _builtin_expect</code> can be
complex, and in some cases, it may be useful to disable the heuristics
so that the effects of <code class="verbatim">_ _builtin_expect</code> are easier to understand.
It is also possible to specify expected probability of the expression
with <code class="verbatim">_ _builtin_expect_with_probability</code> built-in function. The
default is <strong>-fguess-branch-probability</strong> at levels <strong>-O</strong>, <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>,
<strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>

-freorder-blocks

<dd>Reorder basic blocks in the compiled function in

<dt>
-freorder-blocks-algorithm=algorithm
</dt>
<dd>Use the specified algorithm
for basic block reordering. The <em>algorithm</em> argument can be <strong>simple</strong>,
which does not increase code size (except sometimes due to secondary
effects like alignment), or <strong>stc</strong>, the &#34;software trace cache&#34;
algorithm, which tries to put all often executed code together,
minimizing the number of branches executed by making extra copies of

blocks in the compiled function, in order to reduce number of taken
branches, partitions hot and cold basic blocks into separate sections
of the assembly and <em>.o</em> files, to improve paging and cache locality
performance. This optimization is automatically turned off in the
presence of exception handling or unwind tables (on targets using
setjump/longjump or target specific scheme), for linkonce sections,
for functions with a user-defined section attribute and on any
architecture that does not support named sections. When
<strong>-fsplit-stack</strong> is used this option is not enabled by default (to
avoid linker errors), but may be enabled explicitly (if using a
working linker). Enabled for x86 at levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-freorder-functions
</dt>
<dd>Reorder functions in the object file in order
to improve code locality. This is implemented by using special
subsections <code class="verbatim">.text.hot</code> for most frequently executed functions and
<code class="verbatim">.text.unlikely</code> for unlikely executed functions. Reordering is done
by the linker so object file format must support named sections and
linker must place them in a reasonable way. This option isn&#39;t
effective unless you either provide profile feedback (see
<strong>-fprofile-arcs</strong> for details) or manually annotate functions with
<code class="verbatim">hot</code> or <code class="verbatim">cold</code> attributes. Enabled at levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fstrict-aliasing
</dt>
<dd>Allow the compiler to assume the strictest
aliasing rules applicable to the language being compiled. For C (and
C++), this activates optimizations based on the type of expressions.
In particular, an object of one type is assumed never to reside at the
same address as an object of a different type, unless the types are
almost the same. For example, an <code class="verbatim">unsigned int</code> can alias an <code class="verbatim">int</code>,
but not a <code class="verbatim">void*</code> or a <code class="verbatim">double</code>. A character type may alias any other
type. Pay special attention to code like this: union a_union { int i;
double d; }; int f() { union a_union t; t.d = 3.0; return t.i; } The
practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called &#34;type-punning&#34;) is common. Even with
<strong>-fstrict-aliasing</strong>, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory is
accessed through the union type. So, the code above works as expected.
However, this code might not: int f() { union a_union t; int* ip; t.d
= 3.0; ip = &amp;t.i; return *ip; } Similarly, access by taking the
address, casting the resulting pointer and dereferencing the result
has undefined behavior, even if the cast uses a union type, e.g.: int
f() { double d = 3.0; return ((union a_union <strong>) &amp;d)-&gt;i; } The
*-fstrict-aliasing</strong> option is enabled at levels <strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>

<p>Align the start of functions to the next power-of-two greater than or

first <em>m</em> bytes of the function can be fetched by the CPU without
crossing an <em>n</em>-byte alignment boundary. If <em>m</em> is not specified, it
defaults to <em>n</em>. Examples: <strong>-falign-functions=32</strong> aligns functions to
the next 32-byte boundary, <strong>-falign-functions=24</strong> aligns to the next
32-byte boundary only if this can be done by skipping 23 bytes or less,
<strong>-falign-functions=32:7</strong> aligns to the next 32-byte boundary only if
this can be done by skipping 6 bytes or less. The second pair of
<em>n2</em>:/m2/ values allows you to specify a secondary alignment:
<strong>-falign-functions=64:7:32:3</strong> aligns to the next 64-byte boundary if
this can be done by skipping 6 bytes or less, otherwise aligns to the
next 32-byte boundary if this can be done by skipping 2 bytes or less.
If <em>m2</em> is not specified, it defaults to <em>n2</em>. Some assemblers only
support this flag when <em>n</em> is a power of two; in that case, it is
rounded up. <strong>-fno-align-functions</strong> and <strong>-falign-functions=1</strong> are

is better to use attributes when possible. <strong>-ftoplevel-reorder</strong> is the
default at <strong>-O1</strong> and higher, and also at <strong>-O0</strong> if <strong>-fsection-anchors</strong>

<strong>-flto</strong> this option has a limited use. In most cases the precise list
of symbols used or exported from the binary is known the resolution
info passed to the link-time optimizer by the linker plugin. It is
still useful if no linker plugin is used or during incremental link
step when final code is produced (with <strong>-flto</strong>
<strong>-flinker-output=nolto-rel</strong>).</dd>
<dt>
-flto[=n]
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option runs the standard link-time optimizer. When
invoked with source code, it generates GIMPLE (one of GCC&#39;s internal
representations) and writes it to special ELF sections in the object
file. When the object files are linked together, all the function
bodies are read from these ELF sections and instantiated as if they
had been part of the same translation unit. To use the link-time
optimizer, <strong>-flto</strong> and optimization options should be specified at
compile time and during the final link. It is recommended that you
compile all the files participating in the same link with the same
options and also specify those options at link time. For example: gcc
-c -O2 -flto foo.c gcc -c -O2 -flto bar.c gcc -o myprog -flto -O2
foo.o bar.o The first two invocations to GCC save a bytecode
representation of GIMPLE into special ELF sections inside <em>foo.o</em> and
<em>bar.o</em>. The final invocation reads the GIMPLE bytecode from <em>foo.o</em>
and <em>bar.o</em>, merges the two files into a single internal image, and
compiles the result as usual. Since both <em>foo.o</em> and <em>bar.o</em> are
merged into a single image, this causes all the interprocedural
analyses and optimizations in GCC to work across the two files as if
they were a single one. This means, for example, that the inliner is
able to inline functions in <em>bar.o</em> into functions in <em>foo.o</em> and
vice-versa. Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:
gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c bar.c The above generates bytecode for
<em>foo.c</em> and <em>bar.c</em>, merges them together into a single GIMPLE
representation and optimizes them as usual to produce <em>myprog</em>. The
important thing to keep in mind is that to enable link-time
optimizations you need to use the GCC driver to perform the link step.
GCC automatically performs link-time optimization if any of the
objects involved were compiled with the <strong>-flto</strong> command-line option.
You can always override the automatic decision to do link-time
optimization by passing <strong>-fno-lto</strong> to the link command. To make whole
program optimization effective, it is necessary to make certain whole
program assumptions. The compiler needs to know what functions and
variables can be accessed by libraries and runtime outside of the
link-time optimized unit. When supported by the linker, the linker
plugin (see <strong>-fuse-linker-plugin</strong>) passes information to the compiler
about used and externally visible symbols. When the linker plugin is
not available, <strong>-fwhole-program</strong> should be used to allow the compiler
to make these assumptions, which leads to more aggressive optimization
decisions. When a file is compiled with <strong>-flto</strong> without
<strong>-fuse-linker-plugin</strong>, the generated object file is larger than a
regular object file because it contains GIMPLE bytecodes and the usual
final code (see <strong>-ffat-lto-objects</strong>). This means that object files
with LTO information can be linked as normal object files; if
<strong>-fno-lto</strong> is passed to the linker, no interprocedural optimizations
are applied. Note that when <strong>-fno-fat-lto-objects</strong> is enabled the
compile stage is faster but you cannot perform a regular, non-LTO link
on them. When producing the final binary, GCC only applies link-time
optimizations to those files that contain bytecode. Therefore, you can
mix and match object files and libraries with GIMPLE bytecodes and
final object code. GCC automatically selects which files to optimize
in LTO mode and which files to link without further processing.
Generally, options specified at link time override those specified at
compile time, although in some cases GCC attempts to infer link-time
options from the settings used to compile the input files. If you do
not specify an optimization level option <strong>-O</strong> at link time, then GCC
uses the highest optimization level used when compiling the object
files. Note that it is generally ineffective to specify an
optimization level option only at link time and not at compile time,
for two reasons. First, compiling without optimization suppresses
compiler passes that gather information needed for effective
optimization at link time. Second, some early optimization passes can
be performed only at compile time and not at link time. There are some
code generation flags preserved by GCC when generating bytecodes, as
they need to be used during the final link. Currently, the following
options and their settings are taken from the first object file that
explicitly specifies them: <strong>-fcommon</strong>, <strong>-fexceptions</strong>,
<strong>-fnon-call-exceptions</strong>, <strong>-fgnu-tm</strong> and all the <strong>-m</strong> target flags. The
following options <strong>-fPIC</strong>, <strong>-fpic</strong>, <strong>-fpie</strong> and <strong>-fPIE</strong> are combined
based on the following scheme: B&lt;-fPIC&gt; + B&lt;-fpic&gt; = B&lt;-fpic&gt; B&lt;-fPIC&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li>B&lt;-fno-pic&gt; = B&lt;-fno-pic&gt; B&lt;-fpic/-fPIC&gt; + (no option) = (no option)</li>
</ul>
<p>B&lt;-fPIC&gt; + B&lt;-fPIE&gt; = B&lt;-fPIE&gt; B&lt;-fpic&gt; + B&lt;-fPIE&gt; = B&lt;-fpie&gt;
B&lt;-fPIC/-fpic&gt; + B&lt;-fpie&gt; = B&lt;-fpie&gt; Certain ABI-changing flags are
required to match in all compilation units, and trying to override
this at link time with a conflicting value is ignored. This includes
options such as <strong>-freg-struct-return</strong> and <strong>-fpcc-struct-return</strong>. Other
options such as <strong>-ffp-contract</strong>, <strong>-fno-strict-overflow</strong>, <strong>-fwrapv</strong>,
<strong>-fno-trapv</strong> or <strong>-fno-strict-aliasing</strong> are passed through to the link
stage and merged conservatively for conflicting translation units.
Specifically <strong>-fno-strict-overflow</strong>, <strong>-fwrapv</strong> and <strong>-fno-trapv</strong> take
precedence; and for example <strong>-ffp-contract=off</strong> takes precedence over
<strong>-ffp-contract=fast</strong>. You can override them at link time. Diagnostic
options such as <strong>-Wstringop-overflow</strong> are passed through to the link
stage and their setting matches that of the compile-step at function
granularity. Note that this matters only for diagnostics emitted
during optimization. Note that code transforms such as inlining can
lead to warnings being enabled or disabled for regions if code not
consistent with the setting at compile time. When you need to pass
options to the assembler via <strong>-Wa</strong> or <strong>-Xassembler</strong> make sure to
either compile such translation units with <strong>-fno-lto</strong> or consistently
use the same assembler options on all translation units. You can
alternatively also specify assembler options at LTO link time. To
enable debug info generation you need to supply <strong>-g</strong> at compile time.
If any of the input files at link time were built with debug info
generation enabled the link will enable debug info generation as well.
Any elaborate debug info settings like the dwarf level <strong>-gdwarf-5</strong>
need to be explicitly repeated at the linker command line and mixing
different settings in different translation units is discouraged. If
LTO encounters objects with C linkage declared with incompatible types
in separate translation units to be linked together (undefined
behavior according to ISO C99 6.2.7), a non-fatal diagnostic may be
issued. The behavior is still undefined at run time. Similar
diagnostics may be raised for other languages. Another feature of LTO
is that it is possible to apply interprocedural optimizations on files
written in different languages: gcc -c -flto foo.c g++ -c -flto bar.cc
gfortran -c -flto baz.f90 g++ -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o
-lgfortran Notice that the final link is done with <strong>g++</strong> to get the
C++ runtime libraries and <strong>-lgfortran</strong> is added to get the Fortran
runtime libraries. In general, when mixing languages in LTO mode, you
should use the same link command options as when mixing languages in a
regular (non-LTO) compilation. If object files containing GIMPLE
bytecode are stored in a library archive, say <em>libfoo.a</em>, it is
possible to extract and use them in an LTO link if you are using a
linker with plugin support. To create static libraries suitable for
LTO, use <strong>gcc-ar</strong> and <strong>gcc-ranlib</strong> instead of <strong>ar</strong> and <strong>ranlib</strong>; to
show the symbols of object files with GIMPLE bytecode, use <strong>gcc-nm</strong>.
Those commands require that <strong>ar</strong>, <strong>ranlib</strong> and <strong>nm</strong> have been compiled
with plugin support. At link time, use the flag <strong>-fuse-linker-plugin</strong>
to ensure that the library participates in the LTO optimization
process: gcc -o myprog -O2 -flto -fuse-linker-plugin a.o b.o -lfoo
With the linker plugin enabled, the linker extracts the needed GIMPLE
files from <em>libfoo.a</em> and passes them on to the running GCC to make
them part of the aggregated GIMPLE image to be optimized. If you are
not using a linker with plugin support and/or do not enable the linker
plugin, then the objects inside <em>libfoo.a</em> are extracted and linked as
usual, but they do not participate in the LTO optimization process. In
order to make a static library suitable for both LTO optimization and
usual linkage, compile its object files with <strong>-flto</strong>
<strong>-ffat-lto-objects</strong>. Link-time optimizations do not require the
presence of the whole program to operate. If the program does not
require any symbols to be exported, it is possible to combine <strong>-flto</strong>
and <strong>-fwhole-program</strong> to allow the interprocedural optimizers to use
more aggressive assumptions which may lead to improved optimization
opportunities. Use of <strong>-fwhole-program</strong> is not needed when linker
plugin is active (see <strong>-fuse-linker-plugin</strong>). The current
implementation of LTO makes no attempt to generate bytecode that is
portable between different types of hosts. The bytecode files are
versioned and there is a strict version check, so bytecode files
generated in one version of GCC do not work with an older or newer
version of GCC. Link-time optimization does not work well with
generation of debugging information on systems other than those using
a combination of ELF and DWARF. If you specify the optional <em>n</em>, the
optimization and code generation done at link time is executed in
parallel using <em>n</em> parallel jobs by utilizing an installed <strong>make</strong>
program. The environment variable <strong>MAKE</strong> may be used to override the
program used. You can also specify <strong>-flto=jobserver</strong> to use GNU make&#39;s
job server mode to determine the number of parallel jobs. This is
useful when the Makefile calling GCC is already executing in parallel.
You must prepend a <strong>+</strong> to the command recipe in the parent Makefile
for this to work. This option likely only works if <strong>MAKE</strong> is GNU make.
Even without the option value, GCC tries to automatically detect a
running GNU make&#39;s job server. Use <strong>-flto=auto</strong> to use GNU make&#39;s job
server, if available, or otherwise fall back to autodetection of the
number of CPU threads present in your system.</p>

Specifying <strong>none</strong> as an algorithm disables partitioning and streaming
completely. The default value is <strong>balanced</strong>. While <strong>1to1</strong> can be used
as an workaround for various code ordering issues, the <strong>max</strong>
partitioning is intended for internal testing only. The value <strong>one</strong>

supports values from 0 to 9. Values outside this range are clamped to
either minimum or maximum of the supported values. If the option is

-fuse-linker-plugin

<dd>Enables the use of a linker plugin during
link-time optimization. This option relies on plugin support in the
linker, which is available in gold or in GNU ld 2.21 or newer. This
option enables the extraction of object files with GIMPLE bytecode out
of library archives. This improves the quality of optimization by
exposing more code to the link-time optimizer. This information
specifies what symbols can be accessed externally (by non-LTO object
or during dynamic linking). Resulting code quality improvements on
binaries (and shared libraries that use hidden visibility) are similar
to <strong>-fwhole-program</strong>. See <strong>-flto</strong> for a description of the effect of
this flag and how to use it. This option is enabled by default when
LTO support in GCC is enabled and GCC was configured for use with a
linker supporting plugins (GNU ld 2.21 or newer or gold).</dd>
<dt>
-ffat-lto-objects
</dt>
<dd>Fat LTO objects are object files that contain
both the intermediate language and the object code. This makes them

effective only when compiling with <strong>-flto</strong> and is ignored at link
time. <strong>-fno-fat-lto-objects</strong> improves compilation time over plain LTO,
but requires the complete toolchain to be aware of LTO. It requires a
linker with linker plugin support for basic functionality.
Additionally, <strong>nm</strong>, <strong>ar</strong> and <strong>ranlib</strong> need to support linker plugins
to allow a full-featured build environment (capable of building static
libraries etc). GCC provides the <strong>gcc-ar</strong>, <strong>gcc-nm</strong>, <strong>gcc-ranlib</strong>
wrappers to pass the right options to these tools. With non fat LTO
makefiles need to be modified to use them. Note that modern binutils
provide plugin auto-load mechanism. Installing the linker plugin into
<em>=$libdir=/bfd-plugins</em> has the same effect as usage of the command
wrappers (<strong>gcc-ar</strong>, <strong>gcc-nm</strong> and <strong>gcc-ranlib</strong>). The default is
<strong>-fno-fat-lto-objects</strong> on targets with linker plugin support.</dd>

-ftree-loop-distribute-patterns -fprofile-reorder-functions Before you
can use this option, you must first generate profiling information. By
default, GCC emits an error message if the feedback profiles do not
match the source code. This error can be turned into a warning by using
<strong>-Wno-error=coverage-mismatch</strong>. Note this may result in poorly optimized
code. Additionally, by default, GCC also emits a warning message if the
feedback profiles do not exist (see <strong>-Wmissing-profile</strong>). If <em>path</em> is
specified, GCC looks at the <em>path</em> to find the profile feedback data
files. See <strong>-fprofile-dir</strong>.</p>

of a file containing AutoFDO profile information. If omitted, it
defaults to <em>fbdata.afdo</em> in the current directory. Producing an AutoFDO
profile data file requires running your program with the <strong>perf</strong> utility
on a supported GNU/Linux target system. For more information, see

br_inst_retired:near_taken -b -o perf.data \ – your_program Then use
the <strong>create_gcov</strong> tool to convert the raw profile data to a format that
can be used by GCC. You must also supply the unstripped binary for your
program to this tool. See &lt;*<a href="https://github.com/google/autofdo*">https://github.com/google/autofdo*</a>&gt;. E.g.

<p>
The following options control compiler behavior regarding floating-point
arithmetic. These options trade off between speed and correctness. All
must be specifically enabled.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-ffloat-store
</dt>
<dd>Do not store floating-point variables in registers,
and inhibit other options that might change whether a floating-point
value is taken from a register or memory. This option prevents
undesirable excess precision on machines such as the 68000 where the
floating registers (of the 68881) keep more precision than a <code class="verbatim">double</code>
is supposed to have. Similarly for the x86 architecture. For most
programs, the excess precision does only good, but a few programs rely
on the precise definition of IEEE floating point. Use <strong>-ffloat-store</strong>
for such programs, after modifying them to store all pertinent
intermediate computations into variables.</dd>
<dt>
-fexcess-precision=style
</dt>
<dd>This option allows further control over
excess precision on machines where floating-point operations occur in
a format with more precision or range than the IEEE standard and
interchange floating-point types. By default,
<strong>-fexcess-precision=fast</strong> is in effect; this means that operations may
be carried out in a wider precision than the types specified in the
source if that would result in faster code, and it is unpredictable
when rounding to the types specified in the source code takes place.
When compiling C or C++, if <strong>-fexcess-precision=standard</strong> is specified
then excess precision follows the rules specified in ISO C99 or C++;
in particular, both casts and assignments cause values to be rounded
to their semantic types (whereas <strong>-ffloat-store</strong> only affects
assignments). This option is enabled by default for C or C++ if a
strict conformance option such as <strong>-std=c99</strong> or <strong>-std=c++17</strong> is used.
<strong>-ffast-math</strong> enables <strong>-fexcess-precision=fast</strong> by default regardless
of whether a strict conformance option is used.
<strong>-fexcess-precision=standard</strong> is not implemented for languages other
than C or C++. On the x86, it has no effect if <strong>-mfpmath=sse</strong> or
<strong>-mfpmath=sse+387</strong> is specified; in the former case, IEEE semantics
apply without excess precision, and in the latter, rounding is
unpredictable.</dd>
<dt>
-ffast-math
</dt>
<dd>Sets the options <strong>-fno-math-errno</strong>,
<strong>-funsafe-math-optimizations</strong>, <strong>-ffinite-math-only</strong>,
<strong>-fno-rounding-math</strong>, <strong>-fno-signaling-nans</strong>, <strong>-fcx-limited-range</strong> and
<strong>-fexcess-precision=fast</strong>. This option causes the preprocessor macro
<code class="verbatim">_ _FAST_MATH_ _</code> to be defined. This option is not turned on by any
<strong>-O</strong> option besides <strong>-Ofast</strong> since it can result in incorrect output
for programs that depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO
rules/specifications for math functions. It may, however, yield faster
code for programs that do not require the guarantees of these
specifications.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-math-errno
</dt>
<dd>Do not set <code class="verbatim">errno</code> after calling math functions
that are executed with a single instruction, e.g., <code class="verbatim">sqrt</code>. A program
that relies on IEEE exceptions for math error handling may want to use
this flag for speed while maintaining IEEE arithmetic compatibility.
This option is not turned on by any <strong>-O</strong> option since it can result in
incorrect output for programs that depend on an exact implementation
of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math functions. It may,
however, yield faster code for programs that do not require the
guarantees of these specifications. The default is <strong>-fmath-errno</strong>. On
Darwin systems, the math library never sets <code class="verbatim">errno</code>. There is
therefore no reason for the compiler to consider the possibility that
it might, and <strong>-fno-math-errno</strong> is the default.</dd>
<dt>
-funsafe-math-optimizations
</dt>
<dd>Allow optimizations for floating-point
arithmetic that (a) assume that arguments and results are valid and
(b) may violate IEEE or ANSI standards. When used at link time, it may
include libraries or startup files that change the default FPU control
word or other similar optimizations. This option is not turned on by
any <strong>-O</strong> option since it can result in incorrect output for programs
that depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO
rules/specifications for math functions. It may, however, yield faster
code for programs that do not require the guarantees of these
specifications. Enables <strong>-fno-signed-zeros</strong>, <strong>-fno-trapping-math</strong>,
<strong>-fassociative-math</strong> and <strong>-freciprocal-math</strong>. The default is
<strong>-fno-unsafe-math-optimizations</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fassociative-math
</dt>
<dd>Allow re-association of operands in series of
floating-point operations. This violates the ISO C and C++ language
standard by possibly changing computation result. NOTE: re-ordering
may change the sign of zero as well as ignore NaNs and inhibit or
create underflow or overflow (and thus cannot be used on code that
relies on rounding behavior like <code class="verbatim">(x + 2**52) - 2**52</code>. May also
reorder floating-point comparisons and thus may not be used when
ordered comparisons are required. This option requires that both
<strong>-fno-signed-zeros</strong> and <strong>-fno-trapping-math</strong> be in effect. Moreover,
it doesn&#39;t make much sense with <strong>-frounding-math</strong>. For Fortran the
option is automatically enabled when both <strong>-fno-signed-zeros</strong> and
<strong>-fno-trapping-math</strong> are in effect. The default is
<strong>-fno-associative-math</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-freciprocal-math
</dt>
<dd>Allow the reciprocal of a value to be used
instead of dividing by the value if this enables optimizations. For
example <code class="verbatim">x / y</code> can be replaced with <code class="verbatim">x * (1/y)</code>, which is useful if
<code class="verbatim">(1/y)</code> is subject to common subexpression elimination. Note that this
loses precision and increases the number of flops operating on the
value. The default is <strong>-fno-reciprocal-math</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-ffinite-math-only
</dt>
<dd>Allow optimizations for floating-point
arithmetic that assume that arguments and results are not NaNs or
+-Infs. This option is not turned on by any <strong>-O</strong> option since it can
result in incorrect output for programs that depend on an exact
implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math functions.
It may, however, yield faster code for programs that do not require
the guarantees of these specifications. The default is
<strong>-fno-finite-math-only</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-signed-zeros
</dt>
<dd>Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic
that ignore the signedness of zero. IEEE arithmetic specifies the
behavior of distinct +0.0 and -0.0 values, which then prohibits
simplification of expressions such as x+0.0 or 0.0*x (even with
<strong>-ffinite-math-only</strong>). This option implies that the sign of a zero
result isn&#39;t significant. The default is <strong>-fsigned-zeros</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-trapping-math
</dt>
<dd>Compile code assuming that floating-point
operations cannot generate user-visible traps. These traps include
division by zero, overflow, underflow, inexact result and invalid
operation. This option requires that <strong>-fno-signaling-nans</strong> be in
effect. Setting this option may allow faster code if one relies on
&#34;non-stop&#34; IEEE arithmetic, for example. This option should never be
turned on by any <strong>-O</strong> option since it can result in incorrect output
for programs that depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO
rules/specifications for math functions. The default is
<strong>-ftrapping-math</strong>. Future versions of GCC may provide finer control of
this setting using C99&#39;s <code class="verbatim">FENV_ACCESS</code> pragma. This command-line
option will be used along with <strong>-frounding-math</strong> to specify the
default state for <code class="verbatim">FENV_ACCESS</code>.</dd>
<dt>
-frounding-math
</dt>
<dd>Disable transformations and optimizations that
assume default floating-point rounding behavior. This is round-to-zero
for all floating point to integer conversions, and round-to-nearest
for all other arithmetic truncations. This option should be specified
for programs that change the FP rounding mode dynamically, or that may
be executed with a non-default rounding mode. This option disables
constant folding of floating-point expressions at compile time (which
may be affected by rounding mode) and arithmetic transformations that
are unsafe in the presence of sign-dependent rounding modes. The
default is <strong>-fno-rounding-math</strong>. This option is experimental and does
not currently guarantee to disable all GCC optimizations that are
affected by rounding mode. Future versions of GCC may provide finer
control of this setting using C99&#39;s <code class="verbatim">FENV_ACCESS</code> pragma. This
command-line option will be used along with <strong>-ftrapping-math</strong> to
specify the default state for <code class="verbatim">FENV_ACCESS</code>.</dd>
<dt>
-fsignaling-nans
</dt>
<dd>Compile code assuming that IEEE signaling NaNs may
generate user-visible traps during floating-point operations. Setting
this option disables optimizations that may change the number of
exceptions visible with signaling NaNs. This option implies
<strong>-ftrapping-math</strong>. This option causes the preprocessor macro
<code class="verbatim">_ _SUPPORT_SNAN_ _</code> to be defined. The default is
<strong>-fno-signaling-nans</strong>. This option is experimental and does not
currently guarantee to disable all GCC optimizations that affect
signaling NaN behavior.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-fp-int-builtin-inexact
</dt>
<dd>Do not allow the built-in functions
<code class="verbatim">ceil</code>, <code class="verbatim">floor</code>, <code class="verbatim">round</code> and <code class="verbatim">trunc</code>, and their <code class="verbatim">float</code> and <code class="verbatim">long</code>
double variants, to generate code that raises the &#34;inexact&#34;
floating-point exception for noninteger arguments. ISO C99 and C11
allow these functions to raise the &#34;inexact&#34; exception, but ISO/IEC TS
18661-1:2014, the C bindings to IEEE 754-2008, as integrated into ISO
C2X, does not allow these functions to do so. The default is
<strong>-ffp-int-builtin-inexact</strong>, allowing the exception to be raised,
unless C2X or a later C standard is selected. This option does nothing
unless <strong>-ftrapping-math</strong> is in effect. Even if
<strong>-fno-fp-int-builtin-inexact</strong> is used, if the functions generate a
call to a library function then the &#34;inexact&#34; exception may be raised
if the library implementation does not follow TS 18661.</dd>
<dt>
-fsingle-precision-constant
</dt>
<dd>Treat floating-point constants as
single precision instead of implicitly converting them to
double-precision constants.</dd>
<dt>
-fcx-limited-range
</dt>
<dd>When enabled, this option states that a range
reduction step is not needed when performing complex division. Also,
there is no checking whether the result of a complex multiplication or
division is <code class="verbatim">NaN</code> + I*NaN, with an attempt to rescue the situation in
that case. The default is <strong>-fno-cx-limited-range</strong>, but is enabled by
<strong>-ffast-math</strong>. This option controls the default setting of the ISO C99
<code class="verbatim">CX_LIMITED_RANGE</code> pragma. Nevertheless, the option applies to all
languages.</dd>
<dt>
-fcx-fortran-rules
</dt>
<dd>Complex multiplication and division follow
Fortran rules. Range reduction is done as part of complex division,
but there is no checking whether the result of a complex
multiplication or division is <code class="verbatim">NaN</code> + I*NaN, with an attempt to rescue
the situation in that case. The default is <strong>-fno-cx-fortran-rules</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following options control optimizations that may improve
performance, but are not enabled by any <strong>-O</strong> options. This section
includes experimental options that may produce broken code.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-fbranch-probabilities
</dt>
<dd>After running a program compiled with
<strong>-fprofile-arcs</strong>, you can compile it a second time using
<strong>-fbranch-probabilities</strong>, to improve optimizations based on the number
of times each branch was taken. When a program compiled with
<strong>-fprofile-arcs</strong> exits, it saves arc execution counts to a file called
<em>sourcename.gcda</em> for each source file. The information in this data
file is very dependent on the structure of the generated code, so you
must use the same source code and the same optimization options for
both compilations. See details about the file naming in
<strong>-fprofile-arcs</strong>. With <strong>-fbranch-probabilities</strong>, GCC puts a
<strong>REG_BR_PROB</strong> note on each <strong>JUMP_INSN</strong> and <strong>CALL_INSN</strong>. These can be
used to improve optimization. Currently, they are only used in one
place: in <em>reorg.cc</em>, instead of guessing which path a branch is most
likely to take, the <strong>REG_BR_PROB</strong> values are used to exactly determine
which path is taken more often. Enabled by <strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and
<strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fprofile-values
</dt>
<dd>If combined with <strong>-fprofile-arcs</strong>, it adds code so
that some data about values of expressions in the program is gathered.
With <strong>-fbranch-probabilities</strong>, it reads back the data gathered from
profiling values of expressions for usage in optimizations. Enabled by
<strong>-fprofile-generate</strong>, <strong>-fprofile-use</strong>, and <strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fprofile-reorder-functions
</dt>
<dd>Function reordering based on profile
instrumentation collects first time of execution of a function and
orders these functions in ascending order. Enabled with
<strong>-fprofile-use</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fvpt
</dt>
<dd>If combined with <strong>-fprofile-arcs</strong>, this option instructs the
compiler to add code to gather information about values of
expressions. With <strong>-fbranch-probabilities</strong>, it reads back the data
gathered and actually performs the optimizations based on them.
Currently the optimizations include specialization of division
operations using the knowledge about the value of the denominator.
Enabled with <strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and <strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-frename-registers
</dt>
<dd>Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled
code by making use of registers left over after register allocation.
This optimization most benefits processors with lots of registers.
Depending on the debug information format adopted by the target,
however, it can make debugging impossible, since variables no longer
stay in a &#34;home register&#34;. Enabled by default with <strong>-funroll-loops</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fschedule-fusion
</dt>
<dd>Performs a target dependent pass over the
instruction stream to schedule instructions of same type together
because target machine can execute them more efficiently if they are
adjacent to each other in the instruction flow. Enabled at levels
<strong>-O2</strong>, <strong>-O3</strong>, <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-ftracer
</dt>
<dd>Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size. This
transformation simplifies the control flow of the function allowing
other optimizations to do a better job. Enabled by <strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and
<strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-funroll-loops
</dt>
<dd>Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be
determined at compile time or upon entry to the loop. <strong>-funroll-loops</strong>
implies <strong>-frerun-cse-after-loop</strong>, <strong>-fweb</strong> and <strong>-frename-registers</strong>. It
also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops
with a small constant number of iterations). This option makes code
larger, and may or may not make it run faster. Enabled by
<strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and <strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-funroll-all-loops
</dt>
<dd>Unroll all loops, even if their number of
iterations is uncertain when the loop is entered. This usually makes
programs run more slowly. <strong>-funroll-all-loops</strong> implies the same
options as <strong>-funroll-loops</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fpeel-loops
</dt>
<dd>Peels loops for which there is enough information that
they do not roll much (from profile feedback or static analysis). It
also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops
with small constant number of iterations). Enabled by <strong>-O3</strong>,
<strong>-fprofile-use</strong>, and <strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fmove-loop-invariants
</dt>
<dd>Enables the loop invariant motion pass in
the RTL loop optimizer. Enabled at level <strong>-O1</strong> and higher, except for
<strong>-Og</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fmove-loop-stores
</dt>
<dd>Enables the loop store motion pass in the GIMPLE
loop optimizer. This moves invariant stores to after the end of the
loop in exchange for carrying the stored value in a register across
the iteration. Note for this option to have an effect <strong>-ftree-loop-im</strong>
has to be enabled as well. Enabled at level <strong>-O1</strong> and higher, except
for <strong>-Og</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fsplit-loops
</dt>
<dd>Split a loop into two if it contains a condition
that&#39;s always true for one side of the iteration space and false for
the other. Enabled by <strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and <strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-funswitch-loops
</dt>
<dd>Move branches with loop invariant conditions out
of the loop, with duplicates of the loop on both branches (modified
according to result of the condition). Enabled by <strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and
<strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fversion-loops-for-strides
</dt>
<dd>If a loop iterates over an array with a
variable stride, create another version of the loop that assumes the
stride is always one. For example: for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) x[i *
stride] = …; becomes: if (stride == 1) for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
x[i] = …; else for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) x[i * stride] = …; This
is particularly useful for assumed-shape arrays in Fortran where (for
example) it allows better vectorization assuming contiguous accesses.
This flag is enabled by default at <strong>-O3</strong>. It is also enabled by
<strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and <strong>-fauto-profile</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-ffunction-sections
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-fdata-sections
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Place each function or data item into its own section in the output file
if the target supports arbitrary sections. The name of the function or
the name of the data item determines the section&#39;s name in the output
file. Use these options on systems where the linker can perform
optimizations to improve locality of reference in the instruction space.
Most systems using the ELF object format have linkers with such
optimizations. On AIX, the linker rearranges sections (CSECTs) based on
the call graph. The performance impact varies. Together with a linker
garbage collection (linker <strong>–gc-sections</strong> option) these options may
lead to smaller statically-linked executables (after stripping). On
ELF/DWARF systems these options do not degenerate the quality of the
debug information. There could be issues with other object files/debug
info formats. Only use these options when there are significant benefits
from doing so. When you specify these options, the assembler and linker
create larger object and executable files and are also slower. These
options affect code generation. They prevent optimizations by the
compiler and assembler using relative locations inside a translation
unit since the locations are unknown until link time. An example of such
an optimization is relaxing calls to short call instructions.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-fstdarg-opt
</dt>
<dd>Optimize the prologue of variadic argument functions
with respect to usage of those arguments.</dd>
<dt>
-fsection-anchors
</dt>
<dd>Try to reduce the number of symbolic address
calculations by using shared &#34;anchor&#34; symbols to address nearby
objects. This transformation can help to reduce the number of GOT
entries and GOT accesses on some targets. For example, the
implementation of the following function <code class="verbatim">foo</code>: static int a, b, c;
int foo (void) { return a + b + c; } usually calculates the addresses
of all three variables, but if you compile it with
<strong>-fsection-anchors</strong>, it accesses the variables from a common anchor
point instead. The effect is similar to the following pseudocode
(which isn&#39;t valid C): int foo (void) { register int *xr = &amp;x; return
xr[&amp;a - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;b - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;c - &amp;x]; } Not all targets support
this option.</dd>
<dt>
-fzero-call-used-regs=choice
</dt>
<dd>Zero call-used registers at function
return to increase program security by either mitigating
Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) attacks or preventing information
leakage through registers. The possible values of <em>choice</em> are the
same as for the <code class="verbatim">zero_call_used_regs</code> attribute. The default is
<strong>skip</strong>. You can control this behavior for a specific function by using
the function attribute <code class="verbatim">zero_call_used_regs</code>.</dd>
<dt>
–param name=value
</dt>
<dd>
<p>In some places, GCC uses various constants to
control the amount of optimization that is done. For example, GCC does
not inline functions that contain more than a certain number of
instructions. You can control some of these constants on the command
line using the <strong>–param</strong> option. The names of specific parameters, and
the meaning of the values, are tied to the internals of the compiler,
and are subject to change without notice in future releases. In order
to get the minimal, maximal and default values of a parameter, use the
<strong>–help=param -Q</strong> options. In each case, the <em>value</em> is an integer.
The following choices of <em>name</em> are recognized for all targets:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
predictable-branch-outcome
</dt>
<dd>When branch is predicted to be taken
with probability lower than this threshold (in percent), then it is
considered well predictable.</dd>
<dt>
max-rtl-if-conversion-insns
</dt>
<dd>RTL if-conversion tries to remove
conditional branches around a block and replace them with
conditionally executed instructions. This parameter gives the
maximum number of instructions in a block which should be considered
for if-conversion. The compiler will also use other heuristics to
decide whether if-conversion is likely to be profitable.</dd>
<dt>
max-rtl-if-conversion-predictable-cost
</dt>
<dd>RTL if-conversion will try
to remove conditional branches around a block and replace them with
conditionally executed instructions. These parameters give the
maximum permissible cost for the sequence that would be generated by
if-conversion depending on whether the branch is statically
determined to be predictable or not. The units for this parameter
are the same as those for the GCC internal seq_cost metric. The
compiler will try to provide a reasonable default for this parameter
using the BRANCH_COST target macro.</dd>
<dt>
max-crossjump-edges
</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of incoming edges to
consider for cross-jumping. The algorithm used by <strong>-fcrossjumping</strong>
is O(N^2) in the number of edges incoming to each block. Increasing
values mean more aggressive optimization, making the compilation
time increase with probably small improvement in executable size.</dd>
<dt>
min-crossjump-insns
</dt>
<dd>The minimum number of instructions that must
be matched at the end of two blocks before cross-jumping is
performed on them. This value is ignored in the case where all
instructions in the block being cross-jumped from are matched.</dd>
<dt>
max-grow-copy-bb-insns
</dt>
<dd>The maximum code size expansion factor
when copying basic blocks instead of jumping. The expansion is
relative to a jump instruction.</dd>
<dt>
max-goto-duplication-insns
</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of instructions to
duplicate to a block that jumps to a computed goto. To avoid O(N^2)
behavior in a number of passes, GCC factors computed gotos early in
the compilation process, and unfactors them as late as possible.
Only computed jumps at the end of a basic blocks with no more than
max-goto-duplication-insns are unfactored.</dd>
<dt>
max-delay-slot-insn-search
</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of instructions to
consider when looking for an instruction to fill a delay slot. If
more than this arbitrary number of instructions are searched, the
time savings from filling the delay slot are minimal, so stop
searching. Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization,
making the compilation time increase with probably small improvement
in execution time.</dd>
<dt>
max-delay-slot-live-search
</dt>
<dd>When trying to fill delay slots, the
maximum number of instructions to consider when searching for a
block with valid live register information. Increasing this
arbitrarily chosen value means more aggressive optimization,
increasing the compilation time. This parameter should be removed
when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the control-flow
graph.</dd>
<dt>
max-gcse-memory
</dt>
<dd>The approximate maximum amount of memory in <code class="verbatim">kB</code>
that can be allocated in order to perform the global common
subexpression elimination optimization. If more memory than
specified is required, the optimization is not done.</dd>
<dt>
max-gcse-insertion-ratio
</dt>
<dd>If the ratio of expression insertions to
deletions is larger than this value for any expression, then RTL PRE
inserts or removes the expression and thus leaves partially
redundant computations in the instruction stream.</dd>
<dt>
max-pending-list-length
</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of pending
dependencies scheduling allows before flushing the current state and
starting over. Large functions with few branches or calls can create
excessively large lists which needlessly consume memory and
resources.</dd>
<dt>
max-modulo-backtrack-attempts
</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of backtrack
attempts the scheduler should make when modulo scheduling a loop.
Larger values can exponentially increase compilation time.</dd>
<dt>
max-inline-functions-called-once-loop-depth
</dt>
<dd>Maximal loop depth of
a call considered by inline heuristics that tries to inline all
functions called once.</dd>
<dt>
max-inline-functions-called-once-insns
</dt>
<dd>Maximal estimated size of
functions produced while inlining functions called once.</dd>
<dt>
max-inline-insns-single
</dt>
<dd>Several parameters control the tree
inliner used in GCC. This number sets the maximum number of
instructions (counted in GCC&#39;s internal representation) in a single
function that the tree inliner considers for inlining. This only
affects functions declared inline and methods implemented in a class
declaration (C++).</dd>
<dt>
max-inline-insns-auto
</dt>
<dd>When you use <strong>-finline-functions</strong> (included

<dd>This is bound applied to calls which are
considered relevant with <strong>-finline-small-functions</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
max-inline-insns-size

<dd>This is bound applied to calls which are
optimized for size. Small growth may be desirable to anticipate
optimization oppurtunities exposed by inlining.</dd>

<dt>
large-function-insns
</dt>
<dd>The limit specifying really large functions.
For functions larger than this limit after inlining, inlining is

useful primarily to avoid extreme compilation time caused by
non-linear algorithms used by the back end.</dd>
<dt>

limits large function growth to 2.0 times the original size.</dd>
<dt>
large-unit-insns
</dt>
<dd>The limit specifying large translation unit.
Growth caused by inlining of units larger than this limit is limited
by <strong>–param inline-unit-growth</strong>. For small units this might be too
tight. For example, consider a unit consisting of function A that is
inline and B that just calls A three times. If B is small relative
to A, the growth of unit is 300\% and yet such inlining is very
sane. For very large units consisting of small inlineable functions,
however, the overall unit growth limit is needed to avoid
exponential explosion of code size. Thus for smaller units, the size
is increased to <strong>–param large-unit-insns</strong> before applying <strong>–param
inline-unit-growth</strong>.</dd>

min-inline-recursive-probability
</dt>
<dd>Recursive inlining is profitable
only for function having deep recursion in average and can hurt for

size or complexity of function body to other optimizers. When

recursion depth can be guessed from the probability that function
recurses via a given call expression. This parameter limits inlining
only to call expressions whose probability exceeds the given
threshold (in percents).</dd>

profile-func-internal-id
</dt>
<dd>A parameter to control whether to use
function internal id in profile database lookup. If the value is 0,
the compiler uses an id that is based on function assembler name and

gcse-unrestricted-cost
</dt>
<dd>Cost, roughly measured as the cost of a
single typical machine instruction, at which GCSE optimizations do
not constrain the distance an expression can travel. This is
currently supported only in the code hoisting pass. The lesser the

<dd>The denominator n of fraction 1/n of the
maximal execution count of a basic block in the entire program that
a basic block needs to at least have in order to be considered hot.
The default is 10000, which means that a basic block is considered
hot if its execution count is greater than 1/10000 of the maximal
execution count. 0 means that it is never considered hot. Used in

<dd>The maximum number of loop iterations we
predict statically. This is useful in cases where a function
contains a single loop with known bound and another loop with
unknown bound. The known number of iterations is predicted
correctly, while the unknown number of iterations average to
roughly 10. This means that the loop without bounds appears
artificially cold relative to the other one.</dd>

<p>This value is used to limit superblock formation once the given
percentage of executed instructions is covered. This limits
unnecessary code size expansion. The
<strong>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</strong> parameter is used only when profile

estimated ones) are much less balanced allowing the threshold to be
larger value.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
tracer-max-code-growth
</dt>
<dd>Stop tail duplication once code growth has
reached given percentage. This is a rather artificial limit, as most

<p>Stop forward growth if the best edge has probability lower than this

provided. <strong>tracer-min-branch-probability-feedback</strong> is used for
compilation with profile feedback and <strong>tracer-min-branch-probability</strong>
compilation without. The value for compilation with profile feedback
needs to be more conservative (higher) in order to make tracer

<dd>Stack clash protection
involves probing stack space as it is allocated. This param controls
the maximum distance between probes into the stack as 2 raised to

<dt>
ggc-min-expand
</dt>
<dd>GCC uses a garbage collector to manage its own
memory allocation. This parameter specifies the minimum percentage
by which the garbage collector&#39;s heap should be allowed to expand
between collections. Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it
has no effect on code generation. The default is 30% + 70% *
(RAM/1GB) with an upper bound of 100% when RAM &gt;= 1GB. If
<code class="verbatim">getrlimit</code> is available, the notion of &#34;RAM&#34; is the smallest of
actual RAM and <code class="verbatim">RLIMIT_DATA</code> or <code class="verbatim">RLIMIT_AS</code>. If GCC is not able to
calculate RAM on a particular platform, the lower bound of 30% is
used. Setting this parameter and <strong>ggc-min-heapsize</strong> to zero causes a
full collection to occur at every opportunity. This is extremely
slow, but can be useful for debugging.</dd>
<dt>
ggc-min-heapsize
</dt>
<dd>Minimum size of the garbage collector&#39;s heap
before it begins bothering to collect garbage. The first collection
occurs after the heap expands by <strong>ggc-min-expand*% beyond
*ggc-min-heapsize</strong>. Again, tuning this may improve compilation
speed, and has no effect on code generation. The default is the
smaller of RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS, or a limit that tries to ensure that
RLIMIT_DATA or RLIMIT_AS are not exceeded, but with a lower bound of
4096 (four megabytes) and an upper bound of 131072 (128 megabytes).
If GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a particular platform, the
lower bound is used. Setting this parameter very large effectively
disables garbage collection. Setting this parameter and
<strong>ggc-min-expand</strong> to zero causes a full collection to occur at every
opportunity.</dd>

should be issued for non-constant strides. Set to 0 if prefetch
hints should be issued only for strides that are known to be
constant and below <strong>prefetch-minimum-stride</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
prefetch-minimum-stride
</dt>
<dd>Minimum constant stride, in bytes, to
start using prefetch hints for. If the stride is less than this
threshold, prefetch hints will not be issued. This setting is useful
for processors that have hardware prefetchers, in which case there
may be conflicts between the hardware prefetchers and the software
prefetchers. If the hardware prefetchers have a maximum stride they
can handle, it should be used here to improve the use of software
prefetchers. A value of -1 means we don&#39;t have a threshold and
therefore prefetch hints can be issued for any constant stride. This
setting is only useful for strides that are known and constant.</dd>

</dl>
<p>The values for the C++17 variables
<code class="verbatim">std::hardware_destructive_interference_size</code> and
<code class="verbatim">std::hardware_constructive_interference_size</code>. The destructive
interference size is the minimum recommended offset between two
independent concurrently-accessed objects; the constructive
interference size is the maximum recommended size of contiguous memory
accessed together. Typically both will be the size of an L1 cache line
for the target, in bytes. For a generic target covering a range of L1
cache line sizes, typically the constructive interference size will be
the small end of the range and the destructive size will be the large
end. The destructive interference size is intended to be used for
layout, and thus has ABI impact. The default value is not expected to
be stable, and on some targets varies with <strong>-mtune</strong>, so use of this
variable in a context where ABI stability is important, such as the
public interface of a library, is strongly discouraged; if it is used
in that context, users can stabilize the value using this option. The
constructive interference size is less sensitive, as it is typically
only used in a <strong>static_assert</strong> to make sure that a type fits within a
cache line. See also <strong>-Winterference-size</strong>.</p>

(<strong>-ftree-pre</strong>) when optimizing at <strong>-O3</strong> and above. For some sorts of
source code the enhanced partial redundancy elimination optimization
can run away, consuming all of the memory available on the host
machine. This parameter sets a limit on the length of the sets that

ira-max-conflict-table-size
</dt>
<dd>Although IRA uses a sophisticated

optimization performed on them.</dd>
<dt>
loop-max-datarefs-for-datadeps

<dt>
max-vartrack-size
</dt>
<dd>Sets a maximum number of hash table slots to
use during variable tracking dataflow analysis of any function. If
this limit is exceeded with variable tracking at assignments
enabled, analysis for that function is retried without it, after

even without debug insns, var tracking analysis is completely
disabled for the function. Setting the parameter to zero makes it
unlimited.</dd>
<dt>
max-vartrack-expr-depth

<dd>Sets a maximum number of recursion levels
when attempting to map variable names or debug temporaries to value
expressions. This trades compilation time for more complete debug

available and could be represented in debug information may end up
not being used; setting this higher may enable the compiler to find
more complex debug expressions, but compile time and memory use may
grow.</dd>
<dt>
max-debug-marker-count
</dt>
<dd>Sets a threshold on the number of debug
markers (e.g. begin stmt markers) to avoid complexity explosion at
inlining or expanding to RTL. If a function has more such gimple
stmts than the set limit, such stmts will be dropped from the
inlined copy of a function, and from its RTL expansion.</dd>

Program Instrumentation Options
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-16" class="outline-text-3">
<p>GCC supports a number of command-line options that control adding
run-time instrumentation to the code it normally generates. For example,
one purpose of instrumentation is collect profiling statistics for use
in finding program hot spots, code coverage analysis, or profile-guided
optimizations. Another class of program instrumentation is adding
run-time checking to detect programming errors like invalid pointer
dereferences or out-of-bounds array accesses, as well as deliberately
hostile attacks such as stack smashing or C++ vtable hijacking. There is
also a general hook which can be used to implement other forms of
tracing or function-level instrumentation for debug or program analysis
purposes.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-p
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-pg
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <strong>prof</strong> (for <strong>-p</strong>) or <strong>gprof</strong> (for <strong>-pg</strong>). You must use
this option when compiling the source files you want data about, and you
must also use it when linking. You can use the function attribute
<code class="verbatim">no_instrument_function</code> to suppress profiling of individual functions
when compiling with these options.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-fprofile-arcs
</dt>
<dd>Add code so that program flow <em>arcs</em> are
instrumented. During execution the program records how many times each
branch and call is executed and how many times it is taken or returns.
On targets that support constructors with priority support, profiling
properly handles constructors, destructors and C++ constructors (and
destructors) of classes which are used as a type of a global variable.
When the compiled program exits it saves this data to a file called
<em>auxname.gcda</em> for each source file. The data may be used for
profile-directed optimizations (<strong>-fbranch-probabilities</strong>), or for test
coverage analysis (<strong>-ftest-coverage</strong>). Each object file&#39;s <em>auxname</em> is
generated from the name of the output file, if explicitly specified
and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is the basename of
the source file. In both cases any suffix is removed (e.g. <em>foo.gcda</em>
for input file <em>dir/foo.c</em>, or <em>dir/foo.gcda</em> for output file
specified as <strong>-o dir/foo.o</strong>). Note that if a command line directly
links source files, the corresponding <em>.gcda</em> files will be prefixed
with the unsuffixed name of the output file. E.g.
<code class="verbatim">gcc a.c b.c -o binary</code> would generate <em>binary-a.gcda</em> and
<em>binary-b.gcda</em> files.</dd>
<dt>
–coverage
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option is used to compile and link code
instrumented for coverage analysis. The option is a synonym for
<strong>-fprofile-arcs</strong> <strong>-ftest-coverage</strong> (when compiling) and <strong>-lgcov</strong> (when
linking). See the documentation for those options for more details.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile the source files with <strong>-fprofile-arcs</strong> plus optimization and
code generation options. For test coverage analysis, use the
additional <strong>-ftest-coverage</strong> option. You do not need to profile
every source file in a program.</li>
<li>Compile the source files additionally with <strong>-fprofile-abs-path</strong> to
create absolute path names in the <em>.gcno</em> files. This allows <strong>gcov</strong>
to find the correct sources in projects where compilations occur
with different working directories.</li>
<li>Link your object files with <strong>-lgcov</strong> or <strong>-fprofile-arcs</strong> (the latter
implies the former).</li>
<li>Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc
profile information. This may be repeated any number of times. You
can run concurrent instances of your program, and provided that the
file system supports locking, the data files will be correctly
updated. Unless a strict ISO C dialect option is in effect, <code class="verbatim">fork</code>
calls are detected and correctly handled without double counting.
Moreover, an object file can be recompiled multiple times and the
corresponding <em>.gcda</em> file merges as long as the source file and the
compiler options are unchanged.</li>
<li>For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files again
with the same optimization and code generation options plus
<strong>-fbranch-probabilities</strong>.</li>
<li>For test coverage analysis, use <strong>gcov</strong> to produce human readable
information from the <em>.gcno</em> and <em>.gcda</em> files. Refer to the <strong>gcov</strong>
documentation for further information.</li>
</ul>
<p>With <strong>-fprofile-arcs</strong>, for each function of your program GCC creates a
program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph. Only
arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the
compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are
executed. When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block,
the instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a new
basic block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-ftest-coverage
</dt>
<dd>Produce a notes file that the <strong>gcov</strong> code-coverage
utility can use to show program coverage. Each source file&#39;s note file
is called <em>auxname.gcno</em>. Refer to the <strong>-fprofile-arcs</strong> option above
for a description of <em>auxname</em> and instructions on how to generate
test coverage data. Coverage data matches the source files more
closely if you do not optimize.</dd>
<dt>
-fprofile-abs-path
</dt>
<dd>Automatically convert relative source file names
to absolute path names in the <em>.gcno</em> files. This allows <strong>gcov</strong> to
find the correct sources in projects where compilations occur with
different working directories.</dd>
<dt>
-fprofile-dir=path
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the directory to search for the profile data
files in to <em>path</em>. This option affects only the profile data
generated by <strong>-fprofile-generate</strong>, <strong>-ftest-coverage</strong>, <strong>-fprofile-arcs</strong>
and used by <strong>-fprofile-use</strong> and <strong>-fbranch-probabilities</strong> and its
related options. Both absolute and relative paths can be used. By
default, GCC uses the current directory as <em>path</em>, thus the profile
data file appears in the same directory as the object file. In order
to prevent the file name clashing, if the object file name is not an
absolute path, we mangle the absolute path of the <em>sourcename.gcda</em>
file and use it as the file name of a <em>.gcda</em> file. See details about
the file naming in <strong>-fprofile-arcs</strong>. See similar option
<strong>-fprofile-note</strong>. When an executable is run in a massive parallel
environment, it is recommended to save profile to different folders.
That can be done with variables in <em>path</em> that are exported during
run-time:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
%p
</dt>
<dd>process ID.</dd>
<dt>
%q{VAR}
</dt>
<dd>value of environment variable <em>VAR</em></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
-fprofile-generate
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-fprofile-generate=path
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Enable options usually used for instrumenting application to produce
profile useful for later recompilation with profile feedback based
optimization. You must use <strong>-fprofile-generate</strong> both when compiling and
when linking your program. The following options are enabled:
<strong>-fprofile-arcs</strong>, <strong>-fprofile-values</strong>, <strong>-finline-functions</strong>, and
<strong>-fipa-bit-cp</strong>. If <em>path</em> is specified, GCC looks at the <em>path</em> to find
the profile feedback data files. See <strong>-fprofile-dir</strong>. To optimize the
program based on the collected profile information, use <strong>-fprofile-use</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-fprofile-info-section
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-fprofile-info-section=name
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Register the profile information in the specified section instead of
using a constructor/destructor. The section name is <em>name</em> if it is
specified, otherwise the section name defaults to <code class="verbatim">.gcov_info</code>. A
pointer to the profile information generated by <strong>-fprofile-arcs</strong> is
placed in the specified section for each translation unit. This option
disables the profile information registration through a constructor and
it disables the profile information processing through a destructor.
This option is not intended to be used in hosted environments such as
GNU/Linux. It targets freestanding environments (for example embedded
systems) with limited resources which do not support
constructors/destructors or the C library file I/O. The linker could
collect the input sections in a continuous memory block and define start
and end symbols. A GNU linker script example which defines a linker
output section follows: .gcov_info : { PROVIDE (_ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gcov_info_start = .);
KEEP (*(.gcov_info)) PROVIDE (</span> _gcov_info_end = .); } The program could
dump the profiling information registered in this linker set for example
like this: #include &lt;gcov.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
extern const struct gcov_info *const _ _gcov_info_start[]; extern const
struct gcov_info *const _ _gcov_info_end[]; static void dump (const void
​*d, unsigned n, void *arg) { const unsigned char *c = d; for (unsigned i
= 0; i &lt; n; ++i) printf (&#34;%02x&#34;, c[i]); } static void filename (const
char *f, void *arg) { _ _gcov_filename_to_gcfn (f, dump, arg ); } static
void * allocate (unsigned length, void *arg) { return malloc (length); }
static void dump_gcov_info (void) { const struct gcov_info *const *info
= _ _gcov_info_start; const struct gcov_info <strong>const *end =
_ _gcov_info_end; /</strong> Obfuscate variable to prevent compiler
optimizations. */ _ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">asm</span> _ (&#34;&#34; : &#34;+r&#34; (info)); while (info != end) {
void *arg = NULL; _ _gcov_info_to_gcda (*info, filename, dump, allocate,
arg); putchar (\n); ++info; } } int main (void) { dump_gcov_info ();
return 0; } The <strong>merge-stream</strong> subcommand of <strong>gcov-tool</strong> may be used to
deserialize the data stream generated by the <code class="verbatim">_ _gcov_filename_to_gcfn</code>
and <code class="verbatim">_ _gcov_info_to_gcda</code> functions and merge the profile information
into <em>.gcda</em> files on the host filesystem.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-fprofile-note=path
</dt>
<dd>If <em>path</em> is specified, GCC saves <em>.gcno</em> file

files, the <em>.gcno</em> file will be overwritten.</dd>
<dt>
-fprofile-prefix-path=path
</dt>
<dd>This option can be used in combination
with *profile-generate=*/profile_dir/ and *profile-use=*/profile_dir/
to inform GCC where is the base directory of built source tree. By
default <em>profile_dir</em> will contain files with mangled absolute paths
of all object files in the built project. This is not desirable when
directory used to build the instrumented binary differs from the
directory used to build the binary optimized with profile feedback
because the profile data will not be found during the optimized build.
In such setups *-fprofile-prefix-path=*/path/ with <em>path</em> pointing to
the base directory of the build can be used to strip the irrelevant
part of the path and keep all file names relative to the main build
directory.</dd>
<dt>
-fprofile-prefix-map=old=new
</dt>
<dd>When compiling files residing in
directory <em>old</em>, record profiling information (with <strong>–coverage</strong>)
describing them as if the files resided in directory <em>new</em> instead.
See also <strong>-ffile-prefix-map</strong> and <strong>-fcanon-prefix-map</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fprofile-update=method
</dt>
<dd>Alter the update method for an application
instrumented for profile feedback based optimization. The <em>method</em>
argument should be one of <strong>single</strong>, <strong>atomic</strong> or <strong>prefer-atomic</strong>. The
first one is useful for single-threaded applications, while the second
one prevents profile corruption by emitting thread-safe code.
<strong>Warning:</strong> When an application does not properly join all threads (or
creates an detached thread), a profile file can be still corrupted.
Using <strong>prefer-atomic</strong> would be transformed either to <strong>atomic</strong>, when
supported by a target, or to <strong>single</strong> otherwise. The GCC driver
automatically selects <strong>prefer-atomic</strong> when <strong>-pthread</strong> is present in
the command line.</dd>
<dt>
-fprofile-filter-files=regex
</dt>
<dd>Instrument only functions from files
whose name matches any of the regular expressions (separated by
semi-colons). For example,
<strong>-fprofile-filter-files=main\.c;module.</strong>\.c* will instrument only
<em>main.c</em> and all C files starting with &#39;module&#39;.</dd>
<dt>
-fprofile-exclude-files=regex
</dt>
<dd>Instrument only functions from files
whose name does not match any of the regular expressions (separated by
semi-colons). For example, <strong>-fprofile-exclude-files=/usr/.*</strong> will
prevent instrumentation of all files that are located in the <em><em>usr</em></em>
folder.</dd>
<dt>
-fprofile-reproducible=[multithreaded|parallel-runs|serial]
</dt>
<dd>Control
level of reproducibility of profile gathered by <code class="verbatim">-fprofile-generate</code>.
This makes it possible to rebuild program with same outcome which is
useful, for example, for distribution packages. With
<strong>-fprofile-reproducible=serial</strong> the profile gathered by
<strong>-fprofile-generate</strong> is reproducible provided the trained program
behaves the same at each invocation of the train run, it is not
multi-threaded and profile data streaming is always done in the same
order. Note that profile streaming happens at the end of program run
but also before <code class="verbatim">fork</code> function is invoked. Note that it is quite
common that execution counts of some part of programs depends, for
example, on length of temporary file names or memory space
randomization (that may affect hash-table collision rate). Such
non-reproducible part of programs may be annotated by
<code class="verbatim">no_instrument_function</code> function attribute. <strong>gcov-dump</strong> with <strong>-l</strong> can
be used to dump gathered data and verify that they are indeed
reproducible. With <strong>-fprofile-reproducible=parallel-runs</strong> collected
profile stays reproducible regardless the order of streaming of the
data into gcda files. This setting makes it possible to run multiple
instances of instrumented program in parallel (such as with
<code class="verbatim">make -j</code>). This reduces quality of gathered data, in particular of
indirect call profiling.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=address
</dt>
<dd>Enable AddressSanitizer, a fast memory error
detector. Memory access instructions are instrumented to detect
out-of-bounds and use-after-free bugs. The option enables
<strong>-fsanitize-address-use-after-scope</strong>. See
&lt;*<a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer*">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer*</a>&gt; for
more details. The run-time behavior can be influenced using the
<strong>ASAN_OPTIONS</strong> environment variable. When set to <code class="verbatim">help=1</code>, the
available options are shown at startup of the instrumented program.
See
&lt;*<a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerFlags#run-time-flags*">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerFlags#run-time-flags*</a>&gt;
for a list of supported options. The option cannot be combined with
<strong>-fsanitize=thread</strong> or <strong>-fsanitize=hwaddress</strong>. Note that the only
target <strong>-fsanitize=hwaddress</strong> is currently supported on is AArch64. To
get more accurate stack traces, it is possible to use options such as
<strong>-O0</strong>, <strong>-O1</strong>, or <strong>-Og</strong> (which, for instance, prevent most function
inlining), <strong>-fno-optimize-sibling-calls</strong> (which prevents optimizing
sibling and tail recursive calls; this option is implicit for <strong>-O0</strong>,
<strong>-O1</strong>, or <strong>-Og</strong>), or <strong>-fno-ipa-icf</strong> (which disables Identical Code
Folding for functions). Since multiple runs of the program may yield
backtraces with different addresses due to ASLR (Address Space Layout
Randomization), it may be desirable to turn ASLR off. On Linux, this
can be achieved with <strong>setarch `uname -m` -R ./prog</strong>.</dd>

AddressSanitizer for compilation of the Linux kernel. Similar to
<strong>-fsanitize=kernel-address</strong> but using an alternate instrumentation
method, and similar to <strong>-fsanitize=hwaddress</strong> but with instrumentation
differences necessary for compiling the Linux kernel. These
differences are to avoid hwasan library initialization calls and to
account for the stack pointer having a different value in its top
byte. <em>Note:</em> This option has different defaults to the
<strong>-fsanitize=hwaddress</strong>. Instrumenting the stack and alloca calls are
not on by default but are still possible by specifying the
command-line options <strong>–param hwasan-instrument-stack=1</strong> and <strong>–param
hwasan-instrument-allocas=1</strong> respectively. Using a random frame tag is
not implemented for kernel instrumentation.</dd>
<dt>

disabled at run time. To enable it, add
<code class="verbatim">detect_invalid_pointer_pairs=2</code> to the environment variable
<strong>ASAN_OPTIONS</strong>. Using <code class="verbatim">detect_invalid_pointer_pairs=1</code> detects invalid
operation only when both pointers are non-null.</dd>

<dd>Instrument subtraction with pointer
operands. The option must be combined with either
<strong>-fsanitize=kernel-address</strong> or <strong>-fsanitize=address</strong> The option cannot

<dt>
-fsanitize=shadow-call-stack
</dt>
<dd>Enable ShadowCallStack, a security
enhancement mechanism used to protect programs against return address
overwrites (e.g. stack buffer overflows.) It works by saving a
function&#39;s return address to a separately allocated shadow call stack
in the function prologue and restoring the return address from the
shadow call stack in the function epilogue. Instrumentation only
occurs in functions that need to save the return address to the stack.
Currently it only supports the aarch64 platform. It is specifically
designed for linux kernels that enable the CONFIG_SHADOW_CALL_STACK
option. For the user space programs, runtime support is not currently
provided in libc and libgcc. Users who want to use this feature in
user space need to provide their own support for the runtime. It
should be noted that this may cause the ABI rules to be broken. On
aarch64, the instrumentation makes use of the platform register <code class="verbatim">x18</code>.
This generally means that any code that may run on the same thread as
code compiled with ShadowCallStack must be compiled with the flag
<strong>-ffixed-x18</strong>, otherwise functions compiled without <strong>-ffixed-x18</strong>
might clobber <code class="verbatim">x18</code> and so corrupt the shadow stack pointer. Also,
because there is no userspace runtime support, code compiled with
ShadowCallStack cannot use exception handling. Use <strong>-fno-exceptions</strong>
to turn off exceptions. See
&lt;*<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ShadowCallStack.html*">https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ShadowCallStack.html*</a>&gt; for more details.</dd>

builtins cannot throw exceptions when operating on invalid memory
addresses with non-call exceptions (<strong>-fnon-call-exceptions</strong>).</dd>

<dd>Enable LeakSanitizer, a memory leak detector. This
option only matters for linking of executables. The executable is
linked against a library that overrides <code class="verbatim">malloc</code> and other allocator

<strong>UBSAN_OPTIONS</strong> environment variable. Current suboptions are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-fsanitize=shift
</dt>
<dd>This option enables checking that the result of
a shift operation is not undefined. Note that what exactly is
considered undefined differs slightly between C and C++, as well as
between ISO C90 and C99, etc. This option has two suboptions,
<strong>-fsanitize=shift-base</strong> and <strong>-fsanitize=shift-exponent</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=shift-exponent
</dt>
<dd>This option enables checking that the
second argument of a shift operation is not negative and is smaller
than the precision of the promoted first argument.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=shift-base
</dt>
<dd>If the second argument of a shift operation
is within range, check that the result of a shift operation is not
undefined. Note that what exactly is considered undefined differs
slightly between C and C++, as well as between ISO C90 and C99, etc.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=integer-divide-by-zero
</dt>
<dd>Detect integer division by
zero.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=unreachable
</dt>
<dd>With this option, the compiler turns the
<code class="verbatim">_ _builtin_unreachable</code> call into a diagnostics message call
instead. When reaching the <code class="verbatim">_ _builtin_unreachable</code> call, the
behavior is undefined.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=vla-bound
</dt>
<dd>This option instructs the compiler to check
that the size of a variable length array is positive.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=null
</dt>
<dd>This option enables pointer checking.
Particularly, the application built with this option turned on will
issue an error message when it tries to dereference a NULL pointer,
or if a reference (possibly an rvalue reference) is bound to a NULL
pointer, or if a method is invoked on an object pointed by a NULL
pointer.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=return
</dt>
<dd>This option enables return statement checking.
Programs built with this option turned on will issue an error
message when the end of a non-void function is reached without
actually returning a value. This option works in C++ only.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow
</dt>
<dd>This option enables signed
integer overflow checking. We check that the result of <code class="verbatim">+</code>, <code class="verbatim">*</code>, and
both unary and binary <code class="verbatim">-</code> does not overflow in the signed
arithmetics. This also detects <code class="verbatim">INT_MIN / -1</code> signed division. Note,
integer promotion rules must be taken into account. That is, the
following is not an overflow: signed char a = SCHAR_MAX; a++;</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=bounds
</dt>
<dd>This option enables instrumentation of array
bounds. Various out of bounds accesses are detected. Flexible array
members, flexible array member-like arrays, and initializers of
variables with static storage are not instrumented, with the
exception of flexible array member-like arrays for which
<code class="verbatim">-fstrict-flex-arrays</code> or <code class="verbatim">-fstrict-flex-arrays=</code> options or
<code class="verbatim">strict_flex_array</code> attributes say they shouldn&#39;t be treated like
flexible array member-like arrays.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=bounds-strict
</dt>
<dd>This option enables strict
instrumentation of array bounds. Most out of bounds accesses are
detected, including flexible array member-like arrays. Initializers
of variables with static storage are not instrumented.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=alignment
</dt>
<dd>This option enables checking of alignment of
pointers when they are dereferenced, or when a reference is bound to
insufficiently aligned target, or when a method or constructor is
invoked on insufficiently aligned object.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=object-size
</dt>
<dd>This option enables instrumentation of
memory references using the <code class="verbatim">_ _builtin_dynamic_object_size</code>
function. Various out of bounds pointer accesses are detected.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero
</dt>
<dd>Detect floating-point division by
zero. Unlike other similar options,
<strong>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</strong> is not enabled by
<strong>-fsanitize=undefined</strong>, since floating-point division by zero can be
a legitimate way of obtaining infinities and NaNs.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow
</dt>
<dd>This option enables floating-point
type to integer conversion checking. We check that the result of the
conversion does not overflow. Unlike other similar options,
<strong>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</strong> is not enabled by
<strong>-fsanitize=undefined</strong>. This option does not work well with
<code class="verbatim">FE_INVALID</code> exceptions enabled.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=nonnull-attribute
</dt>
<dd>This option enables instrumentation
of calls, checking whether null values are not passed to arguments
marked as requiring a non-null value by the <code class="verbatim">nonnull</code> function
attribute.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=returns-nonnull-attribute
</dt>
<dd>This option enables
instrumentation of return statements in functions marked with
<code class="verbatim">returns_nonnull</code> function attribute, to detect returning of null
values from such functions.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=bool
</dt>
<dd>This option enables instrumentation of loads from
bool. If a value other than 0/1 is loaded, a run-time error is
issued.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=enum
</dt>
<dd>This option enables instrumentation of loads from
an enum type. If a value outside the range of values for the enum
type is loaded, a run-time error is issued.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=vptr
</dt>
<dd>This option enables instrumentation of C++ member
function calls, member accesses and some conversions between
pointers to base and derived classes, to verify the referenced
object has the correct dynamic type.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=pointer-overflow
</dt>
<dd>This option enables instrumentation
of pointer arithmetics. If the pointer arithmetics overflows, a
run-time error is issued.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize=builtin
</dt>
<dd>This option enables instrumentation of
arguments to selected builtin functions. If an invalid value is
passed to such arguments, a run-time error is issued. E.g. passing 0
as the argument to <code class="verbatim">_ _builtin_ctz</code> or <code class="verbatim">_ _builtin_clz</code> invokes
undefined behavior and is diagnosed by this option.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that sanitizers tend to increase the rate of false positive
warnings, most notably those around <strong>-Wmaybe-uninitialized</strong>. We
recommend against combining <strong>-Werror</strong> and [the use of] sanitizers.
While <strong>-ftrapv</strong> causes traps for signed overflows to be emitted,
<strong>-fsanitize=undefined</strong> gives a diagnostic message. This currently
works only for the C family of languages.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-fno-sanitize=all
</dt>
<dd>This option disables all previously enabled
sanitizers. <strong>-fsanitize=all</strong> is not allowed, as some sanitizers cannot
be used together.</dd>
<dt>
-fasan-shadow-offset=number
</dt>
<dd>This option forces GCC to use custom
shadow offset in AddressSanitizer checks. It is useful for
experimenting with different shadow memory layouts in Kernel
AddressSanitizer.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize-sections=s1,s2,…
</dt>
<dd>Sanitize global variables in selected
user-defined sections. <em>si</em> may contain wildcards.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize-recover[=opts]
</dt>
<dd><strong>-fsanitize-recover=</strong> controls error
recovery mode for sanitizers mentioned in comma-separated list of
<em>opts</em>. Enabling this option for a sanitizer component causes it to
attempt to continue running the program as if no error happened. This
means multiple runtime errors can be reported in a single program run,
and the exit code of the program may indicate success even when errors
have been reported. The <strong>-fno-sanitize-recover=</strong> option can be used to
alter this behavior: only the first detected error is reported and
program then exits with a non-zero exit code. Currently this feature
only works for <strong>-fsanitize=undefined</strong> (and its suboptions except for
<strong>-fsanitize=unreachable</strong> and <strong>-fsanitize=return</strong>),
<strong>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</strong>, <strong>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</strong>,
<strong>-fsanitize=bounds-strict</strong>, <strong>-fsanitize=kernel-address</strong> and
<strong>-fsanitize=address</strong>. For these sanitizers error recovery is turned on
by default, except <strong>-fsanitize=address</strong>, for which this feature is
experimental. <strong>-fsanitize-recover=all</strong> and <strong>-fno-sanitize-recover=all</strong>
is also accepted, the former enables recovery for all sanitizers that
support it, the latter disables recovery for all sanitizers that
support it. Even if a recovery mode is turned on the compiler side, it
needs to be also enabled on the runtime library side, otherwise the
failures are still fatal. The runtime library defaults to
<code class="verbatim">halt_on_error=0</code> for ThreadSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer,
while default value for AddressSanitizer is <code class="verbatim">halt_on_error=1</code>. This
can be overridden through setting the <code class="verbatim">halt_on_error</code> flag in the
corresponding environment variable. Syntax without an explicit <em>opts</em>
parameter is deprecated. It is equivalent to specifying an <em>opts</em> list
of: undefined,float-cast-overflow,float-divide-by-zero,bounds-strict</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize-address-use-after-scope
</dt>
<dd>Enable sanitization of local

<strong>-fstack-reuse</strong> to <strong>none</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fsanitize-trap[=opts]
</dt>
<dd>The <strong>-fsanitize-trap=</strong> option instructs the
compiler to report for sanitizers mentioned in comma-separated list of
<em>opts</em> undefined behavior using <code class="verbatim">_ _builtin_trap</code> rather than a
<code class="verbatim">libubsan</code> library routine. If this option is enabled for certain
sanitizer, it takes precedence over the <strong>-fsanitizer-recover=</strong> for
that sanitizer, <code class="verbatim">_ _builtin_trap</code> will be emitted and be fatal
regardless of whether recovery is enabled or disabled using
<strong>-fsanitize-recover=</strong>. The advantage of this is that the <code class="verbatim">libubsan</code>
library is not needed and is not linked in, so this is usable even in
freestanding environments. Currently this feature works with
<strong>-fsanitize=undefined</strong> (and its suboptions except for
<strong>-fsanitize=vptr</strong>), <strong>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</strong>,
<strong>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</strong> and <strong>-fsanitize=bounds-strict</strong>.
<code class="verbatim">-fsanitize-trap=all</code> can be also specified, which enables it for
<code class="verbatim">undefined</code> suboptions, <strong>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</strong>,
<strong>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</strong> and <strong>-fsanitize=bounds-strict</strong>. If
<code class="verbatim">-fsanitize-trap=undefined</code> or <code class="verbatim">-fsanitize-trap=all</code> is used and
<code class="verbatim">-fsanitize=vptr</code> is enabled on the command line, the instrumentation
is silently ignored as the instrumentation always needs <code class="verbatim">libubsan</code>
support, <strong>-fsanitize-trap=vptr</strong> is not allowed.</dd>

<dt>
-fcf-protection=[full|branch|return|none|check]
</dt>
<dd>Enable code
instrumentation of control-flow transfers to increase program security
by checking that target addresses of control-flow transfer
instructions (such as indirect function call, function return,
indirect jump) are valid. This prevents diverting the flow of control
to an unexpected target. This is intended to protect against such
threats as Return-oriented Programming (ROP), and similarly
call/jmp-oriented programming (COP/JOP). The value <code class="verbatim">branch</code> tells the
compiler to implement checking of validity of control-flow transfer at
the point of indirect branch instructions, i.e. call/jmp instructions.
The value <code class="verbatim">return</code> implements checking of validity at the point of
returning from a function. The value <code class="verbatim">full</code> is an alias for specifying
both <code class="verbatim">branch</code> and <code class="verbatim">return</code>. The value <code class="verbatim">none</code> turns off
instrumentation. The value <code class="verbatim">check</code> is used for the final link with
link-time optimization (LTO). An error is issued if LTO object files
are compiled with different <strong>-fcf-protection</strong> values. The value
<code class="verbatim">check</code> is ignored at the compile time. The macro <code class="verbatim">_ _CET_ _</code> is
defined when <strong>-fcf-protection</strong> is used. The first bit of <code class="verbatim">_ _CET_ _</code>
is set to 1 for the value <code class="verbatim">branch</code> and the second bit of <code class="verbatim">_ _CET_ _</code>
is set to 1 for the <code class="verbatim">return</code>. You can also use the <code class="verbatim">nocf_check</code>
attribute to identify which functions and calls should be skipped from
instrumentation. Currently the x86 GNU/Linux target provides an
implementation based on Intel Control-flow Enforcement Technology
(CET) which works for i686 processor or newer.</dd>

variable to functions with vulnerable objects. This includes functions

8 bytes. The guards are initialized when a function is entered and
then checked when the function exits. If a guard check fails, an error
message is printed and the program exits. Only variables that are
actually allocated on the stack are considered, optimized away
variables or variables allocated in registers don&#39;t count.</dd>

-fstack-check
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the
boundary of the stack. You should specify this flag if you are running
in an environment with multiple threads, but you only rarely need to
specify it in a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is
automatically detected on nearly all systems if there is only one
stack. Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be
done; the operating system or the language runtime must do that. The
switch causes generation of code to ensure that they see the stack
being extended. You can additionally specify a string parameter: <strong>no</strong>
means no checking, <strong>generic</strong> means force the use of old-style
checking, <strong>specific</strong> means use the best checking method and is
equivalent to bare <strong>-fstack-check</strong>. Old-style checking is a generic
mechanism that requires no specific target support in the compiler but
comes with the following drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Modified allocation strategy for large objects: they are always
allocated dynamically if their size exceeds a fixed threshold. Note
this may change the semantics of some code.</li>
<li>Fixed limit on the size of the static frame of functions: when it
is topped by a particular function, stack checking is not reliable
and a warning is issued by the compiler.</li>
<li>Inefficiency: because of both the modified allocation strategy and
the generic implementation, code performance is hampered.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that old-style stack checking is also the fallback method for
<strong>specific</strong> if no target support has been added in the compiler.
<strong>-fstack-check=</strong> is designed for Ada&#39;s needs to detect infinite
recursion and stack overflows. <strong>specific</strong> is an excellent choice when
compiling Ada code. It is not generally sufficient to protect against
stack-clash attacks. To protect against those you want
<strong>-fstack-clash-protection</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-fstack-clash-protection
</dt>
<dd>Generate code to prevent stack clash style
attacks. When this option is enabled, the compiler will only allocate
one page of stack space at a time and each page is accessed
immediately after allocation. Thus, it prevents allocations from
jumping over any stack guard page provided by the operating system.
Most targets do not fully support stack clash protection. However, on
those targets <strong>-fstack-clash-protection</strong> will protect dynamic stack
allocations. <strong>-fstack-clash-protection</strong> may also provide limited
protection for static stack allocations if the target supports
<strong>-fstack-check=specific</strong>.</dd>

<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain
value, either the value of a register or the address of a symbol. If a
larger stack is required, a signal is raised at run time. For most
targets, the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.
For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address <strong>0x80000000</strong> and
grows downwards, you can use the flags
<strong>-fstack-limit-symbol=_ _stack_limit</strong> and
<strong>-Wl,–defsym,_ _stack_limit=0x7ffe0000</strong> to enforce a stack limit of
128KB. Note that this may only work with the GNU linker. You can locally
override stack limit checking by using the <code class="verbatim">no_stack_limit</code> function
attribute.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-fsplit-stack
</dt>
<dd>Generate code to automatically split the stack before
it overflows. The resulting program has a discontiguous stack which
can only overflow if the program is unable to allocate any more
memory. This is most useful when running threaded programs, as it is
no longer necessary to calculate a good stack size to use for each
thread. This is currently only implemented for the x86 targets running
GNU/Linux. When code compiled with <strong>-fsplit-stack</strong> calls code compiled
without <strong>-fsplit-stack</strong>, there may not be much stack space available
for the latter code to run. If compiling all code, including library
code, with <strong>-fsplit-stack</strong> is not an option, then the linker can fix
up these calls so that the code compiled without <strong>-fsplit-stack</strong>
always has a large stack. Support for this is implemented in the gold
linker in GNU binutils release 2.21 and later.</dd>
<dt>
-fvtable-verify=[std|preinit|none]
</dt>
<dd>This option is only available
when compiling C++ code. It turns on (or off, if using
<strong>-fvtable-verify=none</strong>) the security feature that verifies at run
time, for every virtual call, that the vtable pointer through which
the call is made is valid for the type of the object, and has not been
corrupted or overwritten. If an invalid vtable pointer is detected at
run time, an error is reported and execution of the program is
immediately halted. This option causes run-time data structures to be
built at program startup, which are used for verifying the vtable
pointers. The options <strong>std</strong> and <strong>preinit</strong> control the timing of when
these data structures are built. In both cases the data structures are
built before execution reaches <code class="verbatim">main</code>. Using <strong>-fvtable-verify=std</strong>
causes the data structures to be built after shared libraries have
been loaded and initialized. <strong>-fvtable-verify=preinit</strong> causes them to
be built before shared libraries have been loaded and initialized. If
this option appears multiple times in the command line with different
values specified, <strong>none</strong> takes highest priority over both <strong>std</strong> and
<strong>preinit</strong>; <strong>preinit</strong> takes priority over <strong>std</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fvtv-debug
</dt>
<dd>When used in conjunction with <strong>-fvtable-verify=std</strong> or
<strong>-fvtable-verify=preinit</strong>, causes debug versions of the runtime
functions for the vtable verification feature to be called. This flag
also causes the compiler to log information about which vtable
pointers it finds for each class. This information is written to a
file named <em>vtv_set_ptr_data.log</em> in the directory named by the
environment variable <strong>VTV_LOGS_DIR</strong> if that is defined or the current
working directory otherwise. Note: This feature <em>appends</em> data to the
log file. If you want a fresh log file, be sure to delete any existing
one.</dd>
<dt>
-fvtv-counts
</dt>
<dd>This is a debugging flag. When used in conjunction
with <strong>-fvtable-verify=std</strong> or <strong>-fvtable-verify=preinit</strong>, this causes
the compiler to keep track of the total number of virtual calls it
encounters and the number of verifications it inserts. It also counts
the number of calls to certain run-time library functions that it
inserts and logs this information for each compilation unit. The
compiler writes this information to a file named <em>vtv_count_data.log</em>
in the directory named by the environment variable <strong>VTV_LOGS_DIR</strong> if
that is defined or the current working directory otherwise. It also
counts the size of the vtable pointer sets for each class, and writes
this information to <em>vtv_class_set_sizes.log</em> in the same directory.
Note: This feature <em>appends</em> data to the log files. To get fresh log
files, be sure to delete any existing ones.</dd>
<dt>
-finstrument-functions
</dt>
<dd>Generate instrumentation calls for entry and
exit to functions. Just after function entry and just before function
exit, the following profiling functions are called with the address of
the current function and its call site. (On some platforms,
<code class="verbatim">_ _builtin_return_address</code> does not work beyond the current function,
so the call site information may not be available to the profiling
functions otherwise.) void _ _cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
void *call_site); void _ _cyg_profile_func_exit (void *this_fn, void
​*call_site); The first argument is the address of the start of the
current function, which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.
This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in
other functions. The profiling calls indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited. This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available. If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size. If you use <code class="verbatim">extern inline</code> in your C code, an addressable
version of such functions must be provided. (This is normally the case
anyway, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always expands the
functions inline, you might have gotten away without providing static
copies.) A function may be given the attribute
<code class="verbatim">no_instrument_function</code>, in which case this instrumentation is not
done. This can be used, for example, for the profiling functions
listed above, high-priority interrupt routines, and any functions from
which the profiling functions cannot safely be called (perhaps signal
handlers, if the profiling routines generate output or allocate
memory).</dd>
<dt>
-finstrument-functions-once
</dt>
<dd>This is similar to
<strong>-finstrument-functions</strong>, but the profiling functions are called only
once per instrumented function, i.e. the first profiling function is
called after the first entry into the instrumented function and the
second profiling function is called before the exit corresponding to
this first entry. The definition of <code class="verbatim">once</code> for the purpose of this
option is a little vague because the implementation is not protected
against data races. As a result, the implementation only guarantees
that the profiling functions are called at <em>least</em> once per process
and at <em>most</em> once per thread, but the calls are always paired, that
is to say, if a thread calls the first function, then it will call the
second function, unless it never reaches the exit of the instrumented
function.</dd>
<dt>
-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=file,file,…
</dt>
<dd>Set the list
of functions that are excluded from instrumentation (see the
description of <strong>-finstrument-functions</strong>). If the file that contains a
function definition matches with one of <em>file</em>, then that function is
not instrumented. The match is done on substrings: if the <em>file</em>
parameter is a substring of the file name, it is considered to be a
match. For example:
-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=/bits/stl,include/sys
excludes any inline function defined in files whose pathnames contain
<em>/bits/stl</em> or <em>include/sys</em>. If, for some reason, you want to include
letter <strong>,</strong> in one of <em>sym</em>, write <strong>,</strong>. For example,
<strong>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=&#39;,,tmp&#39;</strong> (note the single
quote surrounding the option).</dd>
<dt>
-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list=sym,sym,…
</dt>
<dd>This is
similar to <strong>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list</strong>, but this option
sets the list of function names to be excluded from instrumentation.
The function name to be matched is its user-visible name, such as
<code class="verbatim">vector&lt;int&gt; blah(const vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;)</code>, not the internal mangled name
(e.g., <code class="verbatim">_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE</code>). The match is done on substrings:
if the <em>sym</em> parameter is a substring of the function name, it is
considered to be a match. For C99 and C++ extended identifiers, the
function name must be given in UTF-8, not using universal character
names.</dd>
<dt>
-fpatchable-function-entry=N[,M]
</dt>
<dd>Generate <em>N</em> NOPs right at the
beginning of each function, with the function entry point before the
<em>M/th NOP. If /M</em> is omitted, it defaults to <code class="verbatim">0</code> so the function entry
points to the address just at the first NOP. The NOP instructions
reserve extra space which can be used to patch in any desired
instrumentation at run time, provided that the code segment is
writable. The amount of space is controllable indirectly via the
number of NOPs; the NOP instruction used corresponds to the
instruction emitted by the internal GCC back-end interface <code class="verbatim">gen_nop</code>.
This behavior is target-specific and may also depend on the
architecture variant and/or other compilation options. For run-time
identification, the starting addresses of these areas, which
correspond to their respective function entries minus <em>M</em>, are
additionally collected in the <code class="verbatim">_ _patchable_function_entries</code> section
of the resulting binary. Note that the value of
<code class="verbatim">_ _attribute_ _ ((patchable_function_entry</code> (N,M))) takes precedence
over command-line option <strong>-fpatchable-function-entry=N,M</strong>. This can be
used to increase the area size or to remove it completely on a single
function. If <code class="verbatim">N=0</code>, no pad location is recorded. The NOP instructions
are inserted at—and maybe before, depending on <em>M</em>—the function
entry address, even before the prologue. On PowerPC with the ELFv2
ABI, for a function with dual entry points, the local entry point is
this function entry address. The maximum value of <em>N</em> and <em>M</em>
is 65535. On PowerPC with the ELFv2 ABI, for a function with dual
entry points, the supported values for <em>M</em> are 0, 2, 6 and 14.</dd>

Options Controlling the Preprocessor
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-17" class="outline-text-3">
<p>These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.</p>
<p>
If you use the <strong>-E</strong> option, nothing is done except preprocessing. Some
of these options make sense only together with <strong>-E</strong> because they cause
the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual compilation.</p>
<p>
In addition to the options listed here, there are a number of options to
control search paths for include files documented in <strong>Directory
Options</strong>. Options to control preprocessor diagnostics are listed in
<strong>Warning Options</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-D name
</dt>
<dd>Predefine <em>name</em> as a macro, with definition <code class="verbatim">1</code>.</dd>
<dt>
-D name=definition
</dt>
<dd>The contents of <em>definition</em> are tokenized and
processed as if they appeared during translation phase three in a
<strong>#define</strong> directive. In particular, the definition is truncated by
embedded newline characters. If you are invoking the preprocessor from
a shell or shell-like program you may need to use the shell&#39;s quoting
syntax to protect characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the
shell syntax. If you wish to define a function-like macro on the
command line, write its argument list with surrounding parentheses
before the equals sign (if any). Parentheses are meaningful to most
shells, so you should quote the option. With <strong>sh</strong> and <strong>csh</strong>,
<strong>-D&#39;*/name/*(*/args…/</strong>)=*/definition/*&#39;* works. <strong>-D</strong> and <strong>-U</strong>
options are processed in the order they are given on the command line.
All <strong>-imacros</strong> <em>file</em> and <strong>-include</strong> <em>file</em> options are processed
after all <strong>-D</strong> and <strong>-U</strong> options.</dd>
<dt>
-U name
</dt>
<dd>Cancel any previous definition of <em>name</em>, either built in
or provided with a <strong>-D</strong> option.</dd>
<dt>
-include file
</dt>
<dd>Process <em>file</em> as if <code class="verbatim">#include &#34;file&#34;</code> appeared as
the first line of the primary source file. However, the first
directory searched for <em>file</em> is the preprocessor&#39;s working directory
<em>instead of</em> the directory containing the main source file. If not
found there, it is searched for in the remainder of the
<code class="verbatim">#include &#34;...&#34;</code> search chain as normal. If multiple <strong>-include</strong>
options are given, the files are included in the order they appear on
the command line.</dd>
<dt>
-imacros file
</dt>
<dd>Exactly like <strong>-include</strong>, except that any output
produced by scanning <em>file</em> is thrown away. Macros it defines remain
defined. This allows you to acquire all the macros from a header
without also processing its declarations. All files specified by
<strong>-imacros</strong> are processed before all files specified by <strong>-include</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-undef
</dt>
<dd>Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.
The standard predefined macros remain defined.</dd>
<dt>
-pthread
</dt>
<dd>Define additional macros required for using the POSIX
threads library. You should use this option consistently for both
compilation and linking. This option is supported on GNU/Linux
targets, most other Unix derivatives, and also on x86 Cygwin and MinGW
targets.</dd>
<dt>
-M
</dt>
<dd>Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for <strong>make</strong> describing the dependencies of the main source
file. The preprocessor outputs one <strong>make</strong> rule containing the object
file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all the
included files, including those coming from <strong>-include</strong> or <strong>-imacros</strong>
command-line options. Unless specified explicitly (with <strong>-MT</strong> or
<strong>-MQ</strong>), the object file name consists of the name of the source file
with any suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading
directory parts removed. If there are many included files then the
rule is split into several lines using <strong>\</strong>-newline. The rule has no
commands. This option does not suppress the preprocessor&#39;s debug
output, such as <strong>-dM</strong>. To avoid mixing such debug output with the
dependency rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output
file with <strong>-MF</strong>, or use an environment variable like
<strong>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</strong>. Debug output is still sent to the regular
output stream as normal. Passing <strong>-M</strong> to the driver implies <strong>-E</strong>, and
suppresses warnings with an implicit <strong>-w</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-MM
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>-M</strong> but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header. This implies that the
choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an <strong>#include</strong> directive
does not in itself determine whether that header appears in <strong>-MM</strong>
dependency output.</dd>
<dt>
-MF file
</dt>
<dd>When used with <strong>-M</strong> or <strong>-MM</strong>, specifies a file to write
the dependencies to. If no <strong>-MF</strong> switch is given the preprocessor
sends the rules to the same place it would send preprocessed output.
When used with the driver options <strong>-MD</strong> or <strong>-MMD</strong>, <strong>-MF</strong> overrides the
default dependency output file. If <em>file</em> is <em>-</em>, then the
dependencies are written to <em>stdout</em>.</dd>
<dt>
-MG
</dt>
<dd>In conjunction with an option such as <strong>-M</strong> requesting
dependency generation, <strong>-MG</strong> assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error. The dependency filename is taken directly from the
<code class="verbatim">#include</code> directive without prepending any path. <strong>-MG</strong> also
suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders this
useless. This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.</dd>
<dt>
-Mno-modules
</dt>
<dd>Disable dependency generation for compiled module
interfaces.</dd>
<dt>
-MP
</dt>
<dd>This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each
dependency other than the main file, causing each to depend on
nothing. These dummy rules work around errors <strong>make</strong> gives if you
remove header files without updating the <em>Makefile</em> to match. This is
typical output: test.o: test.c test.h test.h:</dd>
<dt>
-MT target
</dt>
<dd>Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency
generation. By default CPP takes the name of the main input file,
deletes any directory components and any file suffix such as <strong>.c</strong>, and
appends the platform&#39;s usual object suffix. The result is the target.
An <strong>-MT</strong> option sets the target to be exactly the string you specify.
If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to <strong>-MT</strong>, or use multiple <strong>-MT</strong> options. For example, <strong>-MT
&#39;$(objpfx)foo.o&#39;</strong> might give $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c</dd>
<dt>
-MQ target
</dt>
<dd>Same as <strong>-MT</strong>, but it quotes any characters which are
special to Make. <strong>-MQ &#39;$(objpfx)foo.o&#39;</strong> gives $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
<strong>-MQ</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-MD
</dt>
<dd><strong>-MD</strong> is equivalent to <strong>-M -MF</strong> <em>file</em>, except that <strong>-E</strong> is not
implied. The driver determines <em>file</em> based on whether an <strong>-o</strong> option
is given. If it is, the driver uses its argument but with a suffix of
<em>.d</em>, otherwise it takes the name of the input file, removes any
directory components and suffix, and applies a <em>.d</em> suffix. If <strong>-MD</strong>
is used in conjunction with <strong>-E</strong>, any <strong>-o</strong> switch is understood to
specify the dependency output file, but if used without <strong>-E</strong>, each
<strong>-o</strong> is understood to specify a target object file. Since <strong>-E</strong> is not
implied, <strong>-MD</strong> can be used to generate a dependency output file as a
side effect of the compilation process.</dd>
<dt>
-MMD
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>-MD</strong> except mention only user header files, not system
header files.</dd>
<dt>
-fpreprocessed
</dt>
<dd>Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has
already been preprocessed. This suppresses things like macro
expansion, trigraph conversion, escaped newline splicing, and
processing of most directives. The preprocessor still recognizes and
removes comments, so that you can pass a file preprocessed with <strong>-C</strong>
to the compiler without problems. In this mode the integrated
preprocessor is little more than a tokenizer for the front ends.
<strong>-fpreprocessed</strong> is implicit if the input file has one of the
extensions <strong>.i</strong>, <strong>.ii</strong> or <strong>.mi</strong>. These are the extensions that GCC
uses for preprocessed files created by <strong>-save-temps</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fdirectives-only
</dt>
<dd>When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not
expand macros. The option&#39;s behavior depends on the <strong>-E</strong> and
<strong>-fpreprocessed</strong> options. With <strong>-E</strong>, preprocessing is limited to the
handling of directives such as <code class="verbatim">#define</code>, <code class="verbatim">#ifdef</code>, and <code class="verbatim">#error</code>.
Other preprocessor operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph
conversion are not performed. In addition, the <strong>-dD</strong> option is
implicitly enabled. With <strong>-fpreprocessed</strong>, predefinition of command
line and most builtin macros is disabled. Macros such as <code class="verbatim">_ _LINE_ _</code>,
which are contextually dependent, are handled normally. This enables
compilation of files previously preprocessed with
<code class="verbatim">-E -fdirectives-only</code>. With both <strong>-E</strong> and <strong>-fpreprocessed</strong>, the rules
for <strong>-fpreprocessed</strong> take precedence. This enables full preprocessing
of files previously preprocessed with <code class="verbatim">-E -fdirectives-only</code>.</dd>
<dt>
-fdollars-in-identifiers
</dt>
<dd>Accept <strong>$</strong> in identifiers.</dd>
<dt>
-fextended-identifiers
</dt>
<dd>Accept universal character names and
extended characters in identifiers. This option is enabled by default
for C99 (and later C standard versions) and C++.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-canonical-system-headers
</dt>
<dd>When preprocessing, do not shorten
system header paths with canonicalization.</dd>
<dt>
-fmax-include-depth=depth
</dt>
<dd>Set the maximum depth of the nested
​#include. The default is 200.</dd>
<dt>
-ftabstop=width
</dt>
<dd>Set the distance between tab stops. This helps the
preprocessor report correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even
if tabs appear on the line. If the value is less than 1 or greater
than 100, the option is ignored. The default is 8.</dd>
<dt>
-ftrack-macro-expansion[=level]
</dt>
<dd>Track locations of tokens across
macro expansions. This allows the compiler to emit diagnostic about
the current macro expansion stack when a compilation error occurs in a
macro expansion. Using this option makes the preprocessor and the
compiler consume more memory. The <em>level</em> parameter can be used to
choose the level of precision of token location tracking thus
decreasing the memory consumption if necessary. Value <strong>0</strong> of <em>level</em>
de-activates this option. Value <strong>1</strong> tracks tokens locations in a
degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode
all tokens resulting from the expansion of an argument of a
function-like macro have the same location. Value <strong>2</strong> tracks tokens
locations completely. This value is the most memory hungry. When this
option is given no argument, the default parameter value is <strong>2</strong>. Note
that <code class="verbatim">-ftrack-macro-expansion=2</code> is activated by default.</dd>
<dt>
-fmacro-prefix-map=old=new
</dt>
<dd>When preprocessing files residing in
directory <em>old</em>, expand the <code class="verbatim">_ _FILE_ _</code> and <code class="verbatim">_ _BASE_FILE_ _</code> macros
as if the files resided in directory <em>new</em> instead. This can be used
to change an absolute path to a relative path by using <em>.</em> for <em>new</em>
which can result in more reproducible builds that are location
independent. This option also affects <code class="verbatim">_ _builtin_FILE()</code> during
compilation. See also <strong>-ffile-prefix-map</strong> and <strong>-fcanon-prefix-map</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fexec-charset=charset
</dt>
<dd>Set the execution character set, used for
string and character constants. The default is UTF-8. <em>charset</em> can be
any encoding supported by the system&#39;s <code class="verbatim">iconv</code> library routine.</dd>
<dt>
-fwide-exec-charset=charset
</dt>
<dd>Set the wide execution character set,
used for wide string and character constants. The default is one of
UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE, UTF-16BE, or UTF-16LE, whichever corresponds to
the width of <code class="verbatim">wchar_t</code> and the big-endian or little-endian byte order
being used for code generation. As with <strong>-fexec-charset</strong>, <em>charset</em>
can be any encoding supported by the system&#39;s <code class="verbatim">iconv</code> library routine;
however, you will have problems with encodings that do not fit exactly
in <code class="verbatim">wchar_t</code>.</dd>
<dt>
-finput-charset=charset
</dt>
<dd>Set the input character set, used for
translation from the character set of the input file to the source
character set used by GCC. If the locale does not specify, or GCC
cannot get this information from the locale, the default is UTF-8.
This can be overridden by either the locale or this command-line
option. Currently the command-line option takes precedence if there&#39;s
a conflict. <em>charset</em> can be any encoding supported by the system&#39;s
<code class="verbatim">iconv</code> library routine.</dd>
<dt>
-fpch-deps
</dt>
<dd>When using precompiled headers, this flag causes the
dependency-output flags to also list the files from the precompiled
header&#39;s dependencies. If not specified, only the precompiled header
are listed and not the files that were used to create it, because
those files are not consulted when a precompiled header is used.</dd>
<dt>
-fpch-preprocess
</dt>
<dd>This option allows use of a precompiled header
together with <strong>-E</strong>. It inserts a special <code class="verbatim">#pragma</code>,
<code class="verbatim">#pragma GCC pch_preprocess &#34;=/=filename=/</code>&#34;= in the output to mark
the place where the precompiled header was found, and its <em>filename</em>.
When <strong>-fpreprocessed</strong> is in use, GCC recognizes this <code class="verbatim">#pragma</code> and
loads the PCH. This option is off by default, because the resulting
preprocessed output is only really suitable as input to GCC. It is
switched on by <strong>-save-temps</strong>. You should not write this <code class="verbatim">#pragma</code> in
your own code, but it is safe to edit the filename if the PCH file is
available in a different location. The filename may be absolute or it
may be relative to GCC&#39;s current directory.</dd>
<dt>
-fworking-directory
</dt>
<dd>Enable generation of linemarkers in the
preprocessor output that let the compiler know the current working
directory at the time of preprocessing. When this option is enabled,
the preprocessor emits, after the initial linemarker, a second
linemarker with the current working directory followed by two slashes.
GCC uses this directory, when it&#39;s present in the preprocessed input,
as the directory emitted as the current working directory in some
debugging information formats. This option is implicitly enabled if
debugging information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the
negated form <strong>-fno-working-directory</strong>. If the <strong>-P</strong> flag is present in
the command line, this option has no effect, since no <code class="verbatim">#line</code>
directives are emitted whatsoever.</dd>
<dt>
-A predicate=answer
</dt>
<dd>Make an assertion with the predicate
<em>predicate</em> and answer <em>answer</em>. This form is preferred to the older
form <strong>-A</strong> /predicate/*(<strong><em>answer</em></strong>)*, which is still supported, because
it does not use shell special characters.</dd>
<dt>
-A -predicate=answer
</dt>
<dd>Cancel an assertion with the predicate
<em>predicate</em> and answer <em>answer</em>.</dd>
<dt>
-C
</dt>
<dd>Do not discard comments. All comments are passed through to the
output file, except for comments in processed directives, which are
deleted along with the directive. You should be prepared for side
effects when using <strong>-C</strong>; it causes the preprocessor to treat comments
as tokens in their own right. For example, comments appearing at the
start of what would be a directive line have the effect of turning
that line into an ordinary source line, since the first token on the
line is no longer a <strong>#</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-CC
</dt>
<dd>Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion. This
is like <strong>-C</strong>, except that comments contained within macros are also
passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded. In
addition to the side effects of the <strong>-C</strong> option, the <strong>-CC</strong> option
causes all C++-style comments inside a macro to be converted to
C-style comments. This is to prevent later use of that macro from
inadvertently commenting out the remainder of the source line. The
<strong>-CC</strong> option is generally used to support lint comments.</dd>
<dt>
-P
</dt>
<dd>Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the
preprocessor. This might be useful when running the preprocessor on
something that is not C code, and will be sent to a program which
might be confused by the linemarkers.</dd>
<dt>
-traditional
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-traditional-cpp
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Try to imitate the behavior of pre-standard C preprocessors, as opposed
to ISO C preprocessors. See the GNU CPP manual for details. Note that
GCC does not otherwise attempt to emulate a pre-standard C compiler, and
these options are only supported with the <strong>-E</strong> switch, or when invoking
CPP explicitly.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-trigraphs
</dt>
<dd>Support ISO C trigraphs. These are three-character
sequences, all starting with <strong>??</strong>, that are defined by ISO C to stand
for single characters. For example, <strong>??/</strong> stands for <strong>\</strong>, so <strong>&#39;??/n&#39;</strong>
is a character constant for a newline. The nine trigraphs and their
replacements are Trigraph: ??( ??) ??&lt; ??&gt; ??= ??/ ?? ??! ??-
Replacement: [ ] { } # \ ^ | ~ By default, GCC ignores trigraphs, but
in standard-conforming modes it converts them. See the <strong>-std</strong> and
<strong>-ansi</strong> options.</dd>
<dt>
-remap
</dt>
<dd>Enable special code to work around file systems which only
permit very short file names, such as MS-DOS.</dd>
<dt>
-H
</dt>
<dd>Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other
normal activities. Each name is indented to show how deep in the
<strong>#include</strong> stack it is. Precompiled header files are also printed,
even if they are found to be invalid; an invalid precompiled header
file is printed with <strong>…x</strong> and a valid one with <strong>…!</strong> .</dd>
<dt>
-dletters
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Says to make debugging dumps during compilation as
specified by <em>letters</em>. The flags documented here are those relevant
to the preprocessor. Other <em>letters</em> are interpreted by the compiler
proper, or reserved for future versions of GCC, and so are silently
ignored. If you specify <em>letters</em> whose behavior conflicts, the result
is undefined.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-dM
</dt>
<dd>Instead of the normal output, generate a list of <strong>#define</strong>
directives for all the macros defined during the execution of the
preprocessor, including predefined macros. This gives you a way of
finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor.
Assuming you have no file <em>foo.h</em>, the command touch foo.h; cpp -dM
foo.h shows all the predefined macros. If you use <strong>-dM</strong> without the
<strong>-E</strong> option, <strong>-dM</strong> is interpreted as a synonym for
<strong>-fdump-rtl-mach</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-dD
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>-dM</strong> except in two respects: it does <em>not</em> include the
predefined macros, and it outputs <em>both</em> the <strong>#define</strong> directives
and the result of preprocessing. Both kinds of output go to the
standard output file.</dd>
<dt>
-dN
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>-dD</strong>, but emit only the macro names, not their
expansions.</dd>
<dt>
-dI
</dt>
<dd>Output <strong>#include</strong> directives in addition to the result of
preprocessing.</dd>
<dt>
-dU
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>-dD</strong> except that only macros that are expanded, or
whose definedness is tested in preprocessor directives, are output;
the output is delayed until the use or test of the macro; and
<strong>#undef</strong> directives are also output for macros tested but undefined
at the time.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
-fdebug-cpp
</dt>
<dd>This option is only useful for debugging GCC. When used
from CPP or with <strong>-E</strong>, it dumps debugging information about location
maps. Every token in the output is preceded by the dump of the map its
location belongs to. When used from GCC without <strong>-E</strong>, this option has
no effect.</dd>
<dt>
-Wp,option
</dt>
<dd>You can use *-Wp,*/option/ to bypass the compiler driver
and pass <em>option</em> directly through to the preprocessor. If <em>option</em>
contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.
However, many options are modified, translated or interpreted by the
compiler driver before being passed to the preprocessor, and <strong>-Wp</strong>
forcibly bypasses this phase. The preprocessor&#39;s direct interface is
undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible you should
avoid using <strong>-Wp</strong> and let the driver handle the options instead.</dd>
<dt>
-Xpreprocessor option
</dt>
<dd>Pass <em>option</em> as an option to the
preprocessor. You can use this to supply system-specific preprocessor
options that GCC does not recognize. If you want to pass an option
that takes an argument, you must use <strong>-Xpreprocessor</strong> twice, once for
the option and once for the argument.</dd>
<dt>
-no-integrated-cpp
</dt>
<dd>Perform preprocessing as a separate pass before
compilation. By default, GCC performs preprocessing as an integrated
part of input tokenization and parsing. If this option is provided,
the appropriate language front end (<strong>cc1</strong>, <strong>cc1plus</strong>, or <strong>cc1obj</strong> for
C, C++, and Objective-C, respectively) is instead invoked twice, once
for preprocessing only and once for actual compilation of the
preprocessed input. This option may be useful in conjunction with the
<strong>-B</strong> or <strong>-wrapper</strong> options to specify an alternate preprocessor or
perform additional processing of the program source between normal
preprocessing and compilation.</dd>
<dt>
-flarge-source-files
</dt>
<dd>Adjust GCC to expect large source files, at
the expense of slower compilation and higher memory usage.
Specifically, GCC normally tracks both column numbers and line numbers
within source files and it normally prints both of these numbers in
diagnostics. However, once it has processed a certain number of source
lines, it stops tracking column numbers and only tracks line numbers.
This means that diagnostics for later lines do not include column
numbers. It also means that options like <strong>-Wmisleading-indentation</strong>
cease to work at that point, although the compiler prints a note if
this happens. Passing <strong>-flarge-source-files</strong> significantly increases
the number of source lines that GCC can process before it stops
tracking columns.</dd>

<dt>
-flinker-output=type
</dt>
<dd>This option controls code generation of the
link-time optimizer. By default the linker output is automatically
determined by the linker plugin. For debugging the compiler and if
incremental linking with a non-LTO object file is desired, it may be
useful to control the type manually. If <em>type</em> is <strong>exec</strong>, code
generation produces a static binary. In this case <strong>-fpic</strong> and <strong>-fpie</strong>
are both disabled. If <em>type</em> is <strong>dyn</strong>, code generation produces a
shared library. In this case <strong>-fpic</strong> or <strong>-fPIC</strong> is preserved, but not
enabled automatically. This allows to build shared libraries without
position-independent code on architectures where this is possible,
i.e. on x86. If <em>type</em> is <strong>pie</strong>, code generation produces an <strong>-fpie</strong>
executable. This results in similar optimizations as <strong>exec</strong> except
that <strong>-fpie</strong> is not disabled if specified at compilation time. If
<em>type</em> is <strong>rel</strong>, the compiler assumes that incremental linking is
done. The sections containing intermediate code for link-time
optimization are merged, pre-optimized, and output to the resulting
object file. In addition, if <strong>-ffat-lto-objects</strong> is specified, binary
code is produced for future non-LTO linking. The object file produced
by incremental linking is smaller than a static library produced from
the same object files. At link time the result of incremental linking
also loads faster than a static library assuming that the majority of
objects in the library are used. Finally <strong>nolto-rel</strong> configures the
compiler for incremental linking where code generation is forced, a
final binary is produced, and the intermediate code for later
link-time optimization is stripped. When multiple object files are
linked together the resulting code is better optimized than with
link-time optimizations disabled (for example, cross-module inlining
happens), but most of benefits of whole program optimizations are
lost. During the incremental link (by <strong>-r</strong>) the linker plugin defaults
to <strong>rel</strong>. With current interfaces to GNU Binutils it is however not
possible to incrementally link LTO objects and non-LTO objects into a
single mixed object file. If any of object files in incremental link
cannot be used for link-time optimization, the linker plugin issues a
warning and uses <strong>nolto-rel</strong>. To maintain whole program optimization,
it is recommended to link such objects into static library instead.
Alternatively it is possible to use H.J. Lu&#39;s binutils with support
for mixed objects.</dd>

GCC. Refer to your linker documentation for exact details. The general
description below applies to the GNU linker. The linker searches a
standard list of directories for the library. The directories searched
include several standard system directories plus any that you specify
with <strong>-L</strong>. Static libraries are archives of object files, and have file
names like <em>liblibrary.a</em>. Some targets also support shared libraries,
which typically have names like <em>liblibrary.so</em>. If both static and
shared libraries are found, the linker gives preference to linking with
the shared library unless the <strong>-static</strong> option is used. It makes a
difference where in the command you write this option; the linker
searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they are
specified. Thus, <strong>foo.o -lz bar.o</strong> searches library <strong>z</strong> after file
<em>foo.o</em> but before <em>bar.o</em>. If <em>bar.o</em> refers to functions in <strong>z</strong>, those
functions may not be loaded.</p>

their inclusion are used as well. This typically removes <strong>-lc</strong> from
the link command line, as well as system libraries that normally go

These entry points should be supplied through some other mechanism

by <strong>-nostdlib</strong> and <strong>-nodefaultlibs</strong> is <em>libgcc.a</em>, a library of
internal subroutines which GCC uses to overcome shortcomings of
particular machines, or special needs for some languages. In most
cases, you need <em>libgcc.a</em> even when you want to avoid other standard
libraries. In other words, when you specify <strong>-nostdlib</strong> or
<strong>-nodefaultlibs</strong> you should usually specify <strong>-lgcc</strong> as well. This
ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal GCC library
subroutines. (An example of such an internal subroutine is <code class="verbatim">_ _main</code>,

</dl>
<p>On systems that provide <em>libgcc</em> as a shared library, these options
force the use of either the shared or static version, respectively. If
no shared version of <em>libgcc</em> was built when the compiler was
configured, these options have no effect. There are several situations
in which an application should use the shared <em>libgcc</em> instead of the
static version. The most common of these is when the application wishes
to throw and catch exceptions across different shared libraries. In that
case, each of the libraries as well as the application itself should use
the shared <em>libgcc</em>. Therefore, the G++ driver automatically adds
<strong>-shared-libgcc</strong> whenever you build a shared library or a main
executable, because C++ programs typically use exceptions, so this is
the right thing to do. If, instead, you use the GCC driver to create
shared libraries, you may find that they are not always linked with the
shared <em>libgcc</em>. If GCC finds, at its configuration time, that you have
a non-GNU linker or a GNU linker that does not support option
<strong>–eh-frame-hdr</strong>, it links the shared version of <em>libgcc</em> into shared
libraries by default. Otherwise, it takes advantage of the linker and
optimizes away the linking with the shared version of <em>libgcc</em>, linking
with the static version of libgcc by default. This allows exceptions to
propagate through such shared libraries, without incurring relocation
costs at library load time. However, if a library or main executable is
supposed to throw or catch exceptions, you must link it using the G++
driver, or using the option <strong>-shared-libgcc</strong>, such that it is linked
with the shared <em>libgcc</em>.</p>

If <em>libasan</em> is available as a shared library, and the <strong>-static</strong>

statically.</dd>

-static-libubsan

<dd>When the <strong>-fsanitize=undefined</strong> option is used to

If <em>libubsan</em> is available as a shared library, and the <strong>-static</strong>

<em>libubsan</em>. The <strong>-static-libubsan</strong> option directs the GCC driver to
link <em>libubsan</em> statically, without necessarily linking other
libraries statically.</dd>
<dt>
-static-libstdc++
</dt>
<dd>When the <strong>g++</strong> program is used to link a C++
program, it normally automatically links against <strong>libstdc++</strong>. If
<em>libstdc++</em> is available as a shared library, and the <strong>-static</strong> option
is not used, then this links against the shared version of
<em>libstdc++</em>. That is normally fine. However, it is sometimes useful to
freeze the version of <em>libstdc++</em> used by the program without going
all the way to a fully static link. The <strong>-static-libstdc++</strong> option
directs the <strong>g++</strong> driver to link <em>libstdc++</em> statically, without
necessarily linking other libraries statically.</dd>
<dt>
-symbolic
</dt>
<dd>Bind references to global symbols when building a shared
object. Warn about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the
link editor option <strong>-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs</strong>). Only a few systems
support this option.</dd>
<dt>
-T script
</dt>
<dd>Use <em>script</em> as the linker script. This option is
supported by most systems using the GNU linker. On some targets, such
as bare-board targets without an operating system, the <strong>-T</strong> option may
be required when linking to avoid references to undefined symbols.</dd>
<dt>
-Xlinker option
</dt>
<dd>Pass <em>option</em> as an option to the linker. You can
use this to supply system-specific linker options that GCC does not
recognize. If you want to pass an option that takes a separate
argument, you must use <strong>-Xlinker</strong> twice, once for the option and once
for the argument. For example, to pass <strong>-assert definitions</strong>, you must
write <strong>-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions</strong>. It does not work to
write <strong>-Xlinker &#34;-assert definitions&#34;</strong>, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.
When using the GNU linker, it is usually more convenient to pass
arguments to linker options using the <em>option/*=*/value</em> syntax than
as separate arguments. For example, you can specify <strong>-Xlinker
-Map=output.map</strong> rather than <strong>-Xlinker -Map -Xlinker output.map</strong>.
Other linkers may not support this syntax for command-line options.</dd>
<dt>
-Wl,option
</dt>
<dd>Pass <em>option</em> as an option to the linker. If <em>option</em>
contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas. You
can use this syntax to pass an argument to the option. For example,
<strong>-Wl,-Map,output.map</strong> passes <strong>-Map output.map</strong> to the linker. When
using the GNU linker, you can also get the same effect with
<strong>-Wl,-Map=output.map</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-u symbol
</dt>
<dd>Pretend the symbol <em>symbol</em> is undefined, to force
linking of library modules to define it. You can use <strong>-u</strong> multiple

prefix; see <strong>–sysroot</strong> and <strong>-isysroot</strong>. Directories specified with
<strong>-iquote</strong> apply only to the quote form of the directive,
<code class="verbatim">#include &#34;=/=file=/</code>&#34;<code class="verbatim">. Directories specified with *-I*, *-isystem*, or
*-idirafter* apply to lookup for both the =#include &#34;=/=file=/</code>&#34;= and
<code class="verbatim">#include &lt;=/=file=/=&gt;</code> directives. You can specify any number or
combination of these options on the command line to search for header
files in several directories. The lookup order is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>For the quote form of the include directive, the directory of the
current file is searched first.</li>
<li>For the quote form of the include directive, the directories
specified by <strong>-iquote</strong> options are searched in left-to-right order,

<p>You can use <strong>-I</strong> to override a system header file, substituting your own

directories that contain vendor-supplied system header files; use
<strong>-isystem</strong> for that. The <strong>-isystem</strong> and <strong>-idirafter</strong> options also mark
the directory as a system directory, so that it gets the same special
treatment that is applied to the standard system directories. If a
standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
<strong>-isystem</strong>, is also specified with <strong>-I</strong>, the <strong>-I</strong> option is ignored. The
directory is still searched but as a system directory at its normal
position in the system include chain. This is to ensure that GCC&#39;s
procedure to fix buggy system headers and the ordering for the
<code class="verbatim">#include_next</code> directive are not inadvertently changed. If you really

<dd>This option specifies where to find the executables,
libraries, include files, and data files of the compiler itself. The
compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms <strong>cpp</strong>,
<strong>cc1</strong>, <strong>as</strong> and <strong>ld</strong>. It tries <em>prefix</em> as a prefix for each program
it tries to run, both with and without /machine/*/*/version/*/* for
the corresponding target machine and compiler version. For each
subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the <strong>-B</strong> prefix,
if any. If that name is not found, or if <strong>-B</strong> is not specified, the
driver tries two standard prefixes, <em><em>usr/lib/gcc</em></em> and
<em><em>usr/local/lib/gcc</em></em>. If neither of those results in a file name that
is found, the unmodified program name is searched for using the
directories specified in your <strong>PATH</strong> environment variable. The
compiler checks to see if the path provided by <strong>-B</strong> refers to a
directory, and if necessary it adds a directory separator character at
the end of the path. <strong>-B</strong> prefixes that effectively specify directory
names also apply to libraries in the linker, because the compiler
translates these options into <strong>-L</strong> options for the linker. They also
apply to include files in the preprocessor, because the compiler
translates these options into <strong>-isystem</strong> options for the preprocessor.
In this case, the compiler appends <strong>include</strong> to the prefix. The
runtime support file <em>libgcc.a</em> can also be searched for using the
<strong>-B</strong> prefix, if needed. If it is not found there, the two standard
prefixes above are tried, and that is all. The file is left out of the
link if it is not found by those means. Another way to specify a
prefix much like the <strong>-B</strong> prefix is to use the environment variable
<strong>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</strong>. As a special kludge, if the path provided by <strong>-B</strong>
is <em>[dir/]stageN/</em>, where <em>N</em> is a number in the range 0 to 9, then it
is replaced by <em>[dir/]include</em>. This is to help with boot-strapping
the compiler.</dd>

–sysroot=dir

<dd>Use <em>dir</em> as the logical root directory for headers
and libraries. For example, if the compiler normally searches for
headers in <em>/usr/include</em> and libraries in <em>/usr/lib</em>, it instead
searches <em>dir/usr/include</em> and <em>dir/usr/lib</em>. If you use both this
option and the <strong>-isysroot</strong> option, then the <strong>–sysroot</strong> option applies
to libraries, but the <strong>-isysroot</strong> option applies to header files. The
GNU linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the necessary support for
this option. If your linker does not support this option, the header
file aspect of <strong>–sysroot</strong> still works, but the library aspect does
not.</dd>

variable ends, and if the variable lives in memory, the optimizing
compiler has the freedom to reuse its stack space with other
temporaries or scoped local variables whose live range does not
overlap with it. Legacy code extending local lifetime is likely to
break with the stack reuse optimization. For example, int *p; { int
local1; p = &amp;local1; local1 = 10; …. } { int local2; local2 = 20;
… } if (*p == 10) // out of scope use of local1 { } Another example:
struct A { A(int k) : i(k), j(k) { } int i; int j; }; A *ap; void
foo(const A&amp; ar) { ap = &amp;ar; } void bar() { foo(A(10)); // temp
objects lifetime ends when foo returns { A a(20); …. } ap-&gt;i+= 10;
<em>/ ap references out of scope temp whose space /</em> is reused with a.
What is the value of ap-&gt;i? } The lifetime of a compiler generated
temporary is well defined by the C++ standard. When a lifetime of a
temporary ends, and if the temporary lives in memory, the optimizing
compiler has the freedom to reuse its stack space with other
temporaries or scoped local variables whose live range does not
overlap with it. However some of the legacy code relies on the
behavior of older compilers in which temporaries&#39; stack space is not
reused, the aggressive stack reuse can lead to runtime errors. This
option is used to control the temporary stack reuse optimization.</dd>
<dt>
-ftrapv
</dt>
<dd>This option generates traps for signed overflow on
addition, subtraction, multiplication operations. The options
<strong>-ftrapv</strong> and <strong>-fwrapv</strong> override each other, so using <strong>-ftrapv</strong>
<strong>-fwrapv</strong> on the command-line results in <strong>-fwrapv</strong> being effective.
Note that only active options override, so using <strong>-ftrapv</strong> <strong>-fwrapv</strong>
<strong>-fno-wrapv</strong> on the command-line results in <strong>-ftrapv</strong> being effective.</dd>
<dt>
-fwrapv
</dt>
<dd>This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed
arithmetic overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps
around using twos-complement representation. This flag enables some
optimizations and disables others. The options <strong>-ftrapv</strong> and <strong>-fwrapv</strong>
override each other, so using <strong>-ftrapv</strong> <strong>-fwrapv</strong> on the command-line
results in <strong>-fwrapv</strong> being effective. Note that only active options
override, so using <strong>-ftrapv</strong> <strong>-fwrapv</strong> <strong>-fno-wrapv</strong> on the
command-line results in <strong>-ftrapv</strong> being effective.</dd>
<dt>
-fwrapv-pointer
</dt>
<dd>This option instructs the compiler to assume that
pointer arithmetic overflow on addition and subtraction wraps around
using twos-complement representation. This flag disables some
optimizations which assume pointer overflow is invalid.</dd>
<dt>
-fstrict-overflow
</dt>
<dd>This option implies <strong>-fno-wrapv</strong>
<strong>-fno-wrapv-pointer</strong> and when negated implies <strong>-fwrapv</strong>
<strong>-fwrapv-pointer</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fexceptions
</dt>
<dd>Enable exception handling. Generates extra code needed
to propagate exceptions. For some targets, this implies GCC generates
frame unwind information for all functions, which can produce
significant data size overhead, although it does not affect execution.
If you do not specify this option, GCC enables it by default for
languages like C++ that normally require exception handling, and
disables it for languages like C that do not normally require it.
However, you may need to enable this option when compiling C code that
needs to interoperate properly with exception handlers written in C++.
You may also wish to disable this option if you are compiling older
C++ programs that don&#39;t use exception handling.</dd>
<dt>
-fnon-call-exceptions
</dt>
<dd>Generate code that allows trapping
instructions to throw exceptions. Note that this requires
platform-specific runtime support that does not exist everywhere.
Moreover, it only allows <em>trapping</em> instructions to throw exceptions,
i.e. memory references or floating-point instructions. It does not
allow exceptions to be thrown from arbitrary signal handlers such as
<code class="verbatim">SIGALRM</code>. This enables <strong>-fexceptions</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fdelete-dead-exceptions
</dt>
<dd>Consider that instructions that may throw
exceptions but don&#39;t otherwise contribute to the execution of the
program can be optimized away. This does not affect calls to functions
except those with the <code class="verbatim">pure</code> or <code class="verbatim">const</code> attributes. This option is
enabled by default for the Ada and C++ compilers, as permitted by the
language specifications. Optimization passes that cause dead
exceptions to be removed are enabled independently at different
optimization levels.</dd>
<dt>
-funwind-tables
</dt>
<dd>Similar to <strong>-fexceptions</strong>, except that it just
generates any needed static data, but does not affect the generated
code in any other way. You normally do not need to enable this option;
instead, a language processor that needs this handling enables it on
your behalf.</dd>
<dt>
-fasynchronous-unwind-tables
</dt>
<dd>Generate unwind table in DWARF format,
if supported by target machine. The table is exact at each instruction
boundary, so it can be used for stack unwinding from asynchronous
events (such as debugger or garbage collector).</dd>
<dt>
-fno-gnu-unique
</dt>
<dd>On systems with recent GNU assembler and C library,
the C++ compiler uses the <code class="verbatim">STB_GNU_UNIQUE</code> binding to make sure that
definitions of template static data members and static local variables
in inline functions are unique even in the presence of <code class="verbatim">RTLD_LOCAL</code>;
this is necessary to avoid problems with a library used by two
different <code class="verbatim">RTLD_LOCAL</code> plugins depending on a definition in one of
them and therefore disagreeing with the other one about the binding of
the symbol. But this causes <code class="verbatim">dlclose</code> to be ignored for affected DSOs;
if your program relies on reinitialization of a DSO via <code class="verbatim">dlclose</code> and
<code class="verbatim">dlopen</code>, you can use <strong>-fno-gnu-unique</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fpcc-struct-return
</dt>
<dd>Return &#34;short&#34; <code class="verbatim">struct</code> and <code class="verbatim">union</code> values in
memory like longer ones, rather than in registers. This convention is
less efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability
between GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers,
particularly the Portable C Compiler (pcc). The precise convention for
returning structures in memory depends on the target configuration
macros. Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment
match that of some integer type. <strong>Warning:</strong> code compiled with the
<strong>-fpcc-struct-return</strong> switch is not binary compatible with code
compiled with the <strong>-freg-struct-return</strong> switch. Use it to conform to a
non-default application binary interface.</dd>
<dt>
-freg-struct-return
</dt>
<dd>Return <code class="verbatim">struct</code> and <code class="verbatim">union</code> values in registers
when possible. This is more efficient for small structures than
<strong>-fpcc-struct-return</strong>. If you specify neither <strong>-fpcc-struct-return</strong>
nor <strong>-freg-struct-return</strong>, GCC defaults to whichever convention is
standard for the target. If there is no standard convention, GCC
defaults to <strong>-fpcc-struct-return</strong>, except on targets where GCC is the
principal compiler. In those cases, we can choose the standard, and we
chose the more efficient register return alternative. <strong>Warning:</strong> code
compiled with the <strong>-freg-struct-return</strong> switch is not binary
compatible with code compiled with the <strong>-fpcc-struct-return</strong> switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.</dd>
<dt>
-fshort-enums
</dt>
<dd>Allocate to an <code class="verbatim">enum</code> type only as many bytes as it
needs for the declared range of possible values. Specifically, the
<code class="verbatim">enum</code> type is equivalent to the smallest integer type that has enough
room. <strong>Warning:</strong> the <strong>-fshort-enums</strong> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that
switch. Use it to conform to a non-default application binary
interface.</dd>
<dt>
-fshort-wchar
</dt>
<dd>Override the underlying type for <code class="verbatim">wchar_t</code> to be
<code class="verbatim">short</code> unsigned int instead of the default for the target. This
option is useful for building programs to run under WINE. <strong>Warning:</strong>
the <strong>-fshort-wchar</strong> switch causes GCC to generate code that is not
binary compatible with code generated without that switch. Use it to
conform to a non-default application binary interface.</dd>
<dt>
-fcommon
</dt>
<dd>In C code, this option controls the placement of global
variables defined without an initializer, known as <em>tentative
definitions</em> in the C standard. Tentative definitions are distinct
from declarations of a variable with the <code class="verbatim">extern</code> keyword, which do
not allocate storage. The default is <strong>-fno-common</strong>, which specifies
that the compiler places uninitialized global variables in the BSS
section of the object file. This inhibits the merging of tentative
definitions by the linker so you get a multiple-definition error if
the same variable is accidentally defined in more than one compilation
unit. The <strong>-fcommon</strong> places uninitialized global variables in a common
block. This allows the linker to resolve all tentative definitions of
the same variable in different compilation units to the same object,
or to a non-tentative definition. This behavior is inconsistent with
C++, and on many targets implies a speed and code size penalty on
global variable references. It is mainly useful to enable legacy code
to link without errors.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-ident
</dt>
<dd>Ignore the <code class="verbatim">#ident</code> directive.</dd>
<dt>
-finhibit-size-directive
</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t output a <code class="verbatim">.size</code> assembler
directive, or anything else that would cause trouble if the function
is split in the middle, and the two halves are placed at locations far
apart in memory. This option is used when compiling <em>crtstuff.c</em>; you
should not need to use it for anything else.</dd>
<dt>
-fverbose-asm
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Put extra commentary information in the generated
assembly code to make it more readable. This option is generally only
of use to those who actually need to read the generated assembly code
(perhaps while debugging the compiler itself). <strong>-fno-verbose-asm</strong>, the
default, causes the extra information to be omitted and is useful when
comparing two assembler files. The added comments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>information on the compiler version and command-line options,</li>
<li>the source code lines associated with the assembly instructions, in
the form FILENAME:LINENUMBER:CONTENT OF LINE,</li>
<li>hints on which high-level expressions correspond to the various
assembly instruction operands.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, given this C source file: int test (int n) { int i; int
total = 0; for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) total += i * i; return total; }
compiling to (x86_64) assembly via <strong>-S</strong> and emitting the result direct
to stdout via <strong>-o</strong> <strong>-</strong> gcc -S test.c -fverbose-asm -Os -o - gives
output similar to this: .file &#34;test.c&#34; # GNU C11 (GCC) version 7.0.0

</dd>
<dt>
-frecord-gcc-switches
</dt>
<dd>This switch causes the command line used to
invoke the compiler to be recorded into the object file that is being
created. This switch is only implemented on some targets and the exact
format of the recording is target and binary file format dependent,
but it usually takes the form of a section containing ASCII text. This
switch is related to the <strong>-fverbose-asm</strong> switch, but that switch only
records information in the assembler output file as comments, so it
never reaches the object file. See also <strong>-grecord-gcc-switches</strong> for
another way of storing compiler options into the object file.</dd>
<dt>
-fpic
</dt>
<dd>Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in
a shared library, if supported for the target machine. Such code
accesses all constant addresses through a global offset table (GOT).
The dynamic loader resolves the GOT entries when the program starts
(the dynamic loader is not part of GCC; it is part of the operating
system). If the GOT size for the linked executable exceeds a
machine-specific maximum size, you get an error message from the
linker indicating that <strong>-fpic</strong> does not work; in that case, recompile
with <strong>-fPIC</strong> instead. (These maximums are 8k on the SPARC, 28k on
AArch64 and 32k on the m68k and RS/6000. The x86 has no such limit.)
Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore
works only on certain machines. For the x86, GCC supports PIC for
System V but not for the Sun 386i. Code generated for the IBM RS/6000
is always position-independent. When this flag is set, the macros
<code class="verbatim">_ _pic_ _</code> and <code class="verbatim">_ _PIC_ _</code> are defined to 1.</dd>
<dt>
-fPIC
</dt>
<dd>If supported for the target machine, emit
position-independent code, suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding
any limit on the size of the global offset table. This option makes a
difference on AArch64, m68k, PowerPC and SPARC. Position-independent
code requires special support, and therefore works only on certain
machines. When this flag is set, the macros <code class="verbatim">_ _pic_ _</code> and
<code class="verbatim">_ _PIC_ _</code> are defined to 2.</dd>
<dt>
-fpie
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-fPIE
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>These options are similar to <strong>-fpic</strong> and <strong>-fPIC</strong>, but the generated
position-independent code can be only linked into executables. Usually
these options are used to compile code that will be linked using the
<strong>-pie</strong> GCC option. <strong>-fpie</strong> and <strong>-fPIE</strong> both define the macros
<code class="verbatim">_ _pie_ _</code> and <code class="verbatim">_ _PIE_ _</code>. The macros have the value 1 for <strong>-fpie</strong> and
2 for <strong>-fPIE</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-fno-plt
</dt>
<dd>Do not use the PLT for external function calls in
position-independent code. Instead, load the callee address at call
sites from the GOT and branch to it. This leads to more efficient code
by eliminating PLT stubs and exposing GOT loads to optimizations. On
architectures such as 32-bit x86 where PLT stubs expect the GOT
pointer in a specific register, this gives more register allocation
freedom to the compiler. Lazy binding requires use of the PLT; with
<strong>-fno-plt</strong> all external symbols are resolved at load time.
Alternatively, the function attribute <code class="verbatim">noplt</code> can be used to avoid
calls through the PLT for specific external functions. In
position-dependent code, a few targets also convert calls to functions
that are marked to not use the PLT to use the GOT instead.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-jump-tables
</dt>
<dd>Do not use jump tables for switch statements even
where it would be more efficient than other code generation
strategies. This option is of use in conjunction with <strong>-fpic</strong> or
<strong>-fPIC</strong> for building code that forms part of a dynamic linker and
cannot reference the address of a jump table. On some targets, jump
tables do not require a GOT and this option is not needed.</dd>
<dt>
-fno-bit-tests
</dt>
<dd>Do not use bit tests for switch statements even
where it would be more efficient than other code generation
strategies.</dd>
<dt>
-ffixed-reg
</dt>
<dd>Treat the register named <em>reg</em> as a fixed register;
generated code should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack
pointer, frame pointer or in some other fixed role). <em>reg</em> must be the
name of a register. The register names accepted are machine-specific
and are defined in the <code class="verbatim">REGISTER_NAMES</code> macro in the machine
description macro file. This flag does not have a negative form,
because it specifies a three-way choice.</dd>
<dt>
-fcall-used-reg
</dt>
<dd>Treat the register named <em>reg</em> as an allocable
register that is clobbered by function calls. It may be allocated for
temporaries or variables that do not live across a call. Functions
compiled this way do not save and restore the register <em>reg</em>. It is an
error to use this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer. Use of
this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in the
machine&#39;s execution model produces disastrous results. This flag does
not have a negative form, because it specifies a three-way choice.</dd>
<dt>
-fcall-saved-reg
</dt>
<dd>Treat the register named <em>reg</em> as an allocable
register saved by functions. It may be allocated even for temporaries
or variables that live across a call. Functions compiled this way save
and restore the register <em>reg</em> if they use it. It is an error to use
this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer. Use of this flag
for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in the machine&#39;s
execution model produces disastrous results. A different sort of
disaster results from the use of this flag for a register in which
function values may be returned. This flag does not have a negative
form, because it specifies a three-way choice.</dd>
<dt>
-fpack-struct[=n]
</dt>
<dd>Without a value specified, pack all structure
members together without holes. When a value is specified (which must
be a small power of two), pack structure members according to this
value, representing the maximum alignment (that is, objects with
default alignment requirements larger than this are output potentially
unaligned at the next fitting location. <strong>Warning:</strong> the <strong>-fpack-struct</strong>
switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary compatible with
code generated without that switch. Additionally, it makes the code
suboptimal. Use it to conform to a non-default application binary
interface.</dd>
<dt>
-fleading-underscore
</dt>
<dd>This option and its counterpart,
<strong>-fno-leading-underscore</strong>, forcibly change the way C symbols are
represented in the object file. One use is to help link with legacy
assembly code. <strong>Warning:</strong> the <strong>-fleading-underscore</strong> switch causes GCC
to generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated
without that switch. Use it to conform to a non-default application
binary interface. Not all targets provide complete support for this
switch.</dd>
<dt>
-ftls-model=model
</dt>
<dd>Alter the thread-local storage model to be used.
The <em>model</em> argument should be one of <strong>global-dynamic</strong>,
<strong>local-dynamic</strong>, <strong>initial-exec</strong> or <strong>local-exec</strong>. Note that the choice
is subject to optimization: the compiler may use a more efficient
model for symbols not visible outside of the translation unit, or if
<strong>-fpic</strong> is not given on the command line. The default without <strong>-fpic</strong>
is <strong>initial-exec</strong>; with <strong>-fpic</strong> the default is <strong>global-dynamic</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-ftrampolines
</dt>
<dd>For targets that normally need trampolines for nested
functions, always generate them instead of using descriptors.
Otherwise, for targets that do not need them, like for example HP-PA
or IA-64, do nothing. A trampoline is a small piece of code that is
created at run time on the stack when the address of a nested function
is taken, and is used to call the nested function indirectly.
Therefore, it requires the stack to be made executable in order for
the program to work properly. <strong>-fno-trampolines</strong> is enabled by default
on a language by language basis to let the compiler avoid generating
them, if it computes that this is safe, and replace them with
descriptors. Descriptors are made up of data only, but the generated
code must be prepared to deal with them. As of this writing,
<strong>-fno-trampolines</strong> is enabled by default only for Ada. Moreover, code
compiled with <strong>-ftrampolines</strong> and code compiled with
<strong>-fno-trampolines</strong> are not binary compatible if nested functions are
present. This option must therefore be used on a program-wide basis
and be manipulated with extreme care. For languages other than Ada,
the <code class="verbatim">-ftrampolines</code> and <code class="verbatim">-fno-trampolines</code> options currently have no
effect, and trampolines are always generated on platforms that need
them for nested functions.</dd>
<dt>
-fvisibility=[default|internal|hidden|protected]
</dt>
<dd>Set the default
ELF image symbol visibility to the specified option—all symbols are
marked with this unless overridden within the code. Using this feature
can very substantially improve linking and load times of shared object
libraries, produce more optimized code, provide near-perfect API
export and prevent symbol clashes. It is <strong>strongly</strong> recommended that
you use this in any shared objects you distribute. Despite the
nomenclature, <strong>default</strong> always means public; i.e., available to be
linked against from outside the shared object. <strong>protected</strong> and
<strong>internal</strong> are pretty useless in real-world usage so the only other
commonly used option is <strong>hidden</strong>. The default if <strong>-fvisibility</strong> isn&#39;t
specified is <strong>default</strong>, i.e., make every symbol public. A good
explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring ELF symbols have the
correct visibility is given by &#34;How To Write Shared Libraries&#34; by
Ulrich Drepper (which can be found at
&lt;*<a href="https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/*">https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/*</a>&gt;)—however a superior solution
made possible by this option to marking things hidden when the default
is public is to make the default hidden and mark things public. This
is the norm with DLLs on Windows and with <strong>-fvisibility=hidden</strong> and
<code class="verbatim">_ _attribute_ _ ((visibility(&#34;default&#34;)))</code> instead of
<code class="verbatim">_ _declspec(dllexport)</code> you get almost identical semantics with
identical syntax. This is a great boon to those working with
cross-platform projects. For those adding visibility support to
existing code, you may find <code class="verbatim">#pragma GCC visibility</code> of use. This
works by you enclosing the declarations you wish to set visibility for
with (for example) <code class="verbatim">#pragma GCC visibility push(hidden)</code> and
<code class="verbatim">#pragma GCC visibility pop</code>. Bear in mind that symbol visibility
should be viewed <strong>as</strong> part of the API interface contract and thus all
new code should always specify visibility when it is not the default;
i.e., declarations only for use within the local DSO should <strong>always</strong>
be marked explicitly as hidden as so to avoid PLT indirection
overheads—making this abundantly clear also aids readability and
self-documentation of the code. Note that due to ISO C++ specification
requirements, <code class="verbatim">operator new</code> and <code class="verbatim">operator delete</code> must always be of
default visibility. Be aware that headers from outside your project,
in particular system headers and headers from any other library you
use, may not be expecting to be compiled with visibility other than
the default. You may need to explicitly say
<code class="verbatim">#pragma GCC visibility push(default)</code> before including any such
headers. <code class="verbatim">extern</code> declarations are not affected by <strong>-fvisibility</strong>, so
a lot of code can be recompiled with <strong>-fvisibility=hidden</strong> with no
modifications. However, this means that calls to <code class="verbatim">extern</code> functions
with no explicit visibility use the PLT, so it is more effective to
use <code class="verbatim">_ _attribute ((visibility))</code> and/or <code class="verbatim">#pragma GCC visibility</code> to
tell the compiler which <code class="verbatim">extern</code> declarations should be treated as
hidden. Note that <strong>-fvisibility</strong> does affect C++ vague linkage
entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class that is be
thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked with default visibility
so that the <strong>type_info</strong> nodes are unified between the DSOs. An
overview of these techniques, their benefits and how to use them is at
&lt;*<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility*">https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility*</a>&gt;.</dd>
<dt>
-fstrict-volatile-bitfields
</dt>
<dd>This option should be used if accesses
to volatile bit-fields (or other structure fields, although the
compiler usually honors those types anyway) should use a single access
of the width of the field&#39;s type, aligned to a natural alignment if
possible. For example, targets with memory-mapped peripheral registers
might require all such accesses to be 16 bits wide; with this flag you
can declare all peripheral bit-fields as <code class="verbatim">unsigned short</code> (assuming
short is 16 bits on these targets) to force GCC to use 16-bit accesses
instead of, perhaps, a more efficient 32-bit access. If this option is
disabled, the compiler uses the most efficient instruction. In the
previous example, that might be a 32-bit load instruction, even though
that accesses bytes that do not contain any portion of the bit-field,
or memory-mapped registers unrelated to the one being updated. In some
cases, such as when the <code class="verbatim">packed</code> attribute is applied to a structure
field, it may not be possible to access the field with a single read
or write that is correctly aligned for the target machine. In this
case GCC falls back to generating multiple accesses rather than code
that will fault or truncate the result at run time. Note: Due to
restrictions of the C/C++11 memory model, write accesses are not
allowed to touch non bit-field members. It is therefore recommended to
define all bits of the field&#39;s type as bit-field members. The default
value of this option is determined by the application binary interface
for the target processor.</dd>
<dt>
-fsync-libcalls
</dt>
<dd>This option controls whether any out-of-line
instance of the <code class="verbatim">_ _sync</code> family of functions may be used to implement
the C++11 <code class="verbatim">_ _atomic</code> family of functions. The default value of this
option is enabled, thus the only useful form of the option is
<strong>-fno-sync-libcalls</strong>. This option is used in the implementation of the
<em>libatomic</em> runtime library.</dd>

GCC Developer Options

<div id="outline-text-headline-22" class="outline-text-3">
<p>This section describes command-line options that are primarily of
interest to GCC developers, including options to support compiler
testing and investigation of compiler bugs and compile-time performance
problems. This includes options that produce debug dumps at various
points in the compilation; that print statistics such as memory use and
execution time; and that print information about GCC&#39;s configuration,
such as where it searches for libraries. You should rarely need to use
any of these options for ordinary compilation and linking tasks.</p>
<p>
Many developer options that cause GCC to dump output to a file take an
optional <strong>=*/filename/ suffix. You can specify *stdout</strong> or <strong>-</strong> to dump
to standard output, and <strong>stderr</strong> for standard error.</p>
<p>
If *=*/filename/ is omitted, a default dump file name is constructed by
concatenating the base dump file name, a pass number, phase letter, and
pass name. The base dump file name is the name of output file produced
by the compiler if explicitly specified and not an executable; otherwise
it is the source file name. The pass number is determined by the order
passes are registered with the compiler&#39;s pass manager. This is
generally the same as the order of execution, but passes registered by
plugins, target-specific passes, or passes that are otherwise registered
late are numbered higher than the pass named <strong>final</strong>, even if they are
executed earlier. The phase letter is one of <strong>i</strong> (inter-procedural
analysis), <strong>l</strong> (language-specific), <strong>r</strong> (RTL), or <strong>t</strong> (tree). The files
are created in the directory of the output file.</p>

specified. When the <code class="verbatim">su</code> marker is specified, the callgraph is decorated
with stack usage information; it is equivalent to <strong>-fstack-usage</strong>. When

information about dynamically allocated objects. When compiling with

<blockquote>
<p>To determine what tree dumps are available or find the dump for a pass
of interest follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Invoke GCC with <strong>-fdump-passes</strong> and in the <em>stderr</em> output look for a
code that corresponds to the pass you are interested in. For example,
the codes <code class="verbatim">tree-evrp</code>, <code class="verbatim">tree-vrp1</code>, and <code class="verbatim">tree-vrp2</code> correspond to the
three Value Range Propagation passes. The number at the end
distinguishes distinct invocations of the same pass.</li>
<li>To enable the creation of the dump file, append the pass code to the
<strong>-fdump-</strong> option prefix and invoke GCC with it. For example, to
enable the dump from the Early Value Range Propagation pass, invoke
GCC with the <strong>-fdump-tree-evrp</strong> option. Optionally, you may specify
the name of the dump file. If you don&#39;t specify one, GCC creates as
described below.</li>
<li>Find the pass dump in a file whose name is composed of three
components separated by a period: the name of the source file GCC was
invoked to compile, a numeric suffix indicating the pass number
followed by the letter <strong>t</strong> for tree passes (and the letter <strong>r</strong> for
RTL passes), and finally the pass code. For example, the Early VRP
pass dump might be in a file named <em>myfile.c.038t.evrp</em> in the
current working directory. Note that the numeric codes are not stable
and may change from one version of GCC to another.</li>

<p>If <em>options</em> is omitted, it defaults to <strong>optimized-optall</strong>, which means
to dump messages about successful optimizations from all the passes,
omitting messages that are treated as &#34;internals&#34;. If the <em>filename</em> is
provided, then the dumps from all the applicable optimizations are
concatenated into the <em>filename</em>. Otherwise the dump is output onto
<em>stderr</em>. Though multiple <strong>-fopt-info</strong> options are accepted, only one of
them can include a <em>filename</em>. If other filenames are provided then all
but the first such option are ignored. Note that the output <em>filename</em>
is overwritten in case of multiple translation units. If a combined
output from multiple translation units is desired, <em>stderr</em> should be
used instead. In the following example, the optimization info is output
to <em>stderr</em>: gcc -O3 -fopt-info This example: gcc -O3
-fopt-info-missed=missed.all outputs missed optimization report from all
the passes into <em>missed.all</em>, and this one: gcc -O2 -ftree-vectorize
-fopt-info-vec-missed prints information about missed optimization
opportunities from vectorization passes on <em>stderr</em>. Note that
<strong>-fopt-info-vec-missed</strong> is equivalent to <strong>-fopt-info-missed-vec</strong>. The
order of the optimization group names and message types listed after
<strong>-fopt-info</strong> does not matter. As another example, gcc -O3
-fopt-info-inline-optimized-missed=inline.txt outputs information about
missed optimizations as well as optimized locations from all the
inlining passes into <em>inline.txt</em>. Finally, consider: gcc
-fopt-info-vec-missed=vec.miss -fopt-info-loop-optimized=loop.opt Here
the two output filenames <em>vec.miss</em> and <em>loop.opt</em> are in conflict since
only one output file is allowed. In this case, only the first option
takes effect and the subsequent options are ignored. Thus only
<em>vec.miss</em> is produced which contains dumps from the vectorizer about
missed opportunities.</p>

For <em>n</em> greater than one, it also output basic block probabilities,
detailed ready list information and unit/insn info. For <em>n</em> greater

statically invoked in the compiler multiple times, the pass name should
be appended with a sequential number starting from 1. <em>range-list</em> is a
comma-separated list of function ranges or assembler names. Each range
is a number pair separated by a colon. The range is inclusive in both
ends. If the range is trivial, the number pair can be simplified as a
single number. If the function&#39;s call graph node&#39;s <em>uid</em> falls within
one of the specified ranges, the <em>pass</em> is disabled for that function.
The <em>uid</em> is shown in the function header of a dump file, and the pass

<dl>
<dt>
-frandom-seed=string
</dt>
<dd>This option provides a seed that GCC uses in
place of random numbers in generating certain symbol names that have
to be different in every compiled file. It is also used to place
unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files that produce
them. You can use the <strong>-frandom-seed</strong> option to produce reproducibly
identical object files. The <em>string</em> can either be a number (decimal,
octal or hex) or an arbitrary string (in which case it&#39;s converted to
a number by computing CRC32). The <em>string</em> should be different for
every file you compile.</dd>
<dt>
-save-temps
</dt>
<dd>Store the usual &#34;temporary&#34; intermediate files
permanently; name them as auxiliary output files, as specified
described under <strong>-dumpbase</strong> and <strong>-dumpdir</strong>. When used in combination
with the <strong>-x</strong> command-line option, <strong>-save-temps</strong> is sensible enough to
avoid overwriting an input source file with the same extension as an
intermediate file. The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained
by renaming the source file before using <strong>-save-temps</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-save-temps=cwd
</dt>
<dd>Equivalent to <strong>-save-temps -dumpdir ./</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-save-temps=obj
</dt>
<dd>Equivalent to *-save-temps -dumpdir */*outdir/*/,
where <em>outdir/</em> is the directory of the output file specified after
the <strong>-o</strong> option, including any directory separators. If the <strong>-o</strong>
option is not used, the <strong>-save-temps=obj</strong> switch behaves like
<strong>-save-temps=cwd</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-time[=file]
</dt>
<dd>Report the CPU time taken by each subprocess in the
compilation sequence. For C source files, this is the compiler proper
and assembler (plus the linker if linking is done). Without the
specification of an output file, the output looks like this: # cc1
0.12 0.01 # as 0.00 0.01 The first number on each line is the &#34;user
time&#34;, that is time spent executing the program itself. The second
number is &#34;system time&#34;, time spent executing operating system
routines on behalf of the program. Both numbers are in seconds. With
the specification of an output file, the output is appended to the
named file, and it looks like this: 0.12 0.01 cc1 &lt;options&gt; 0.00 0.01
as &lt;options&gt; The &#34;user time&#34; and the &#34;system time&#34; are moved before
the program name, and the options passed to the program are displayed,
so that one can later tell what file was being compiled, and with
which options.</dd>
<dt>
-fdump-final-insns[=file]
</dt>
<dd>Dump the final internal representation
(RTL) to <em>file</em>. If the optional argument is omitted (or if <em>file</em> is
<code class="verbatim">.</code>), the name of the dump file is determined by appending <code class="verbatim">.gkd</code> to
the dump base name, see <strong>-dumpbase</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fcompare-debug[=opts]
</dt>
<dd>If no error occurs during compilation, run
the compiler a second time, adding <em>opts</em> and <strong>-fcompare-debug-second</strong>
to the arguments passed to the second compilation. Dump the final
internal representation in both compilations, and print an error if
they differ. If the equal sign is omitted, the default <strong>-gtoggle</strong> is
used. The environment variable <strong>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</strong>, if defined,
non-empty and nonzero, implicitly enables <strong>-fcompare-debug</strong>. If
<strong>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</strong> is defined to a string starting with a dash, then
it is used for <em>opts</em>, otherwise the default <strong>-gtoggle</strong> is used.
<strong>-fcompare-debug=</strong>, with the equal sign but without <em>opts</em>, is
equivalent to <strong>-fno-compare-debug</strong>, which disables the dumping of the
final representation and the second compilation, preventing even
<strong>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</strong> from taking effect. To verify full coverage during
<strong>-fcompare-debug</strong> testing, set <strong>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</strong> to say
<strong>-fcompare-debug-not-overridden</strong>, which GCC rejects as an invalid
option in any actual compilation (rather than preprocessing, assembly
or linking). To get just a warning, setting <strong>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</strong> to
<strong>-w%n-fcompare-debug</strong> not overridden will do.</dd>
<dt>
-fcompare-debug-second
</dt>
<dd>This option is implicitly passed to the
compiler for the second compilation requested by <strong>-fcompare-debug</strong>,
along with options to silence warnings, and omitting other options
that would cause the compiler to produce output to files or to
standard output as a side effect. Dump files and preserved temporary
files are renamed so as to contain the <code class="verbatim">.gk</code> additional extension
during the second compilation, to avoid overwriting those generated by
the first. When this option is passed to the compiler driver, it
causes the <em>first</em> compilation to be skipped, which makes it useful
for little other than debugging the compiler proper.</dd>
<dt>
-gtoggle
</dt>
<dd>Turn off generation of debug info, if leaving out this
option generates it, or turn it on at level 2 otherwise. The position
of this argument in the command line does not matter; it takes effect
after all other options are processed, and it does so only once, no
matter how many times it is given. This is mainly intended to be used
with <strong>-fcompare-debug</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle
</dt>
<dd>Toggle
<strong>-fvar-tracking-assignments</strong>, in the same way that <strong>-gtoggle</strong> toggles
<strong>-g</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-Q
</dt>
<dd>Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is
compiled, and print some statistics about each pass when it finishes.</dd>
<dt>
-ftime-report
</dt>
<dd>Makes the compiler print some statistics about the
time consumed by each pass when it finishes.</dd>
<dt>
-ftime-report-details
</dt>
<dd>Record the time consumed by infrastructure
parts separately for each pass.</dd>
<dt>
-fira-verbose=n
</dt>
<dd>Control the verbosity of the dump file for the
integrated register allocator. The default value is 5. If the value
<em>n</em> is greater or equal to 10, the dump output is sent to stderr using
the same format as <em>n</em> minus 10.</dd>
<dt>
-flto-report
</dt>
<dd>Prints a report with internal details on the workings
of the link-time optimizer. The contents of this report vary from
version to version. It is meant to be useful to GCC developers when
processing object files in LTO mode (via <strong>-flto</strong>). Disabled by
default.</dd>

<dd>Makes the compiler print some statistics about
permanent memory allocation when it finishes.</dd>

<dd></dd>
<dt>
-fpost-ipa-mem-report
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory

<dl>
<dt>
-fmultiflags
</dt>
<dd>This option enables multilib-aware <code class="verbatim">TFLAGS</code> to be used
to build target libraries with options different from those the
compiler is configured to use by default, through the use of specs
Like <code class="verbatim">TFLAGS</code>, this allows the target libraries to be built for
portable baseline environments, while the compiler defaults to more
demanding ones. That&#39;s useful because users can easily override the
defaults the compiler is configured to use to build their own
programs, if the defaults are not ideal for their target environment,
whereas rebuilding the runtime libraries is usually not as easy or
desirable. Unlike <code class="verbatim">TFLAGS</code>, the use of specs enables different flags
to be selected for different multilibs. The way to accomplish that is
to build with <strong>make TFLAGS=-fmultiflags</strong>, after configuring
<strong>–with-specs=%{fmultiflags:…}</strong>. This option is discarded by the
driver once it&#39;s done processing driver self spec. It is also useful
to check that <code class="verbatim">TFLAGS</code> are being used to build all target libraries,
by configuring a non-bootstrap compiler
<strong>–with-specs=&#39;%{!fmultiflags:%emissing TFLAGS}&#39;</strong> and building the
compiler and target libraries.</dd>
<dt>
-fprofile-report
</dt>
<dd>Makes the compiler print some statistics about
consistency of the (estimated) profile and effect of individual
passes.</dd>
<dt>
-fstack-usage
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Makes the compiler output stack usage information for
the program, on a per-function basis. The filename for the dump is
made by appending <em>.su</em> to the <em>auxname</em>. <em>auxname</em> is generated from
the name of the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an
executable, otherwise it is the basename of the source file. An entry
is made up of three fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the function.</li>
<li>A number of bytes.</li>
<li>One or more qualifiers: <code class="verbatim">static</code>, <code class="verbatim">dynamic</code>, <code class="verbatim">bounded</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The qualifier <code class="verbatim">static</code> means that the function manipulates the stack
statically: a fixed number of bytes are allocated for the frame on
function entry and released on function exit; no stack adjustments are
otherwise made in the function. The second field is this fixed number
of bytes. The qualifier <code class="verbatim">dynamic</code> means that the function manipulates
the stack dynamically: in addition to the static allocation described
above, stack adjustments are made in the body of the function, for
example to push/pop arguments around function calls. If the qualifier
<code class="verbatim">bounded</code> is also present, the amount of these adjustments is bounded
at compile time and the second field is an upper bound of the total
amount of stack used by the function. If it is not present, the amount
of these adjustments is not bounded at compile time and the second
field only represents the bounded part.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-fstats
</dt>
<dd>Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of
the compilation. This option is supported only by the C++ front end,
and the information is generally only useful to the G++ development
team.</dd>
<dt>
-fdbg-cnt-list
</dt>
<dd>Print the name and the counter upper bound for all
debug counters.</dd>
<dt>
-fdbg-cnt=counter-value-list
</dt>
<dd>Set the internal debug counter lower
and upper bound. <em>counter-value-list</em> is a comma-separated list of
<em>name</em>:/lower_bound1/-<em>upper_bound1</em>
[:/lower_bound2/-<em>upper_bound2</em>…] tuples which sets the name of the
counter and list of closed intervals. The <em>lower_bound</em> is optional
and is zero initialized if not set. For example, with
<strong>-fdbg-cnt=dce:2-4:10-11,tail_call:10</strong>, <code class="verbatim">dbg_cnt(dce)</code> returns true
only for second, third, fourth, tenth and eleventh invocation. For
<code class="verbatim">dbg_cnt(tail_call)</code> true is returned for first 10 invocations.</dd>
<dt>
-print-file-name=library
</dt>
<dd>Print the full absolute name of the
library file <em>library</em> that would be used when linking—and don&#39;t do
anything else. With this option, GCC does not compile or link
anything; it just prints the file name.</dd>
<dt>
-print-multi-directory
</dt>
<dd>Print the directory name corresponding to
the multilib selected by any other switches present in the command
line. This directory is supposed to exist in <strong>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-print-multi-lib
</dt>
<dd>Print the mapping from multilib directory names to
compiler switches that enable them. The directory name is separated
from the switches by <strong>;</strong>, and each switch starts with an <strong>@</strong> instead
of the <strong>-</strong>, without spaces between multiple switches. This is supposed
to ease shell processing.</dd>
<dt>
-print-multi-os-directory
</dt>
<dd>Print the path to OS libraries for the
selected multilib, relative to some <em>lib</em> subdirectory. If OS
libraries are present in the <em>lib</em> subdirectory and no multilibs are
used, this is usually just <em>.</em>, if OS libraries are present in
<em>libsuffix</em> sibling directories this prints e.g. <em>../lib64</em>, <em>../lib</em>
or <em>../lib32</em>, or if OS libraries are present in <em>lib/subdir</em>
subdirectories it prints e.g. <em>amd64</em>, <em>sparcv9</em> or <em>ev6</em>.</dd>
<dt>
-print-multiarch
</dt>
<dd>Print the path to OS libraries for the selected
multiarch, relative to some <em>lib</em> subdirectory.</dd>
<dt>
-print-prog-name=program
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>-print-file-name</strong>, but searches for
a program such as <strong>cpp</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-print-libgcc-file-name
</dt>
<dd>Same as <strong>-print-file-name=libgcc.a</strong>. This
is useful when you use <strong>-nostdlib</strong> or <strong>-nodefaultlibs</strong> but you do want
to link with <em>libgcc.a</em>. You can do: gcc -nostdlib &lt;files&gt;… `gcc
-print-libgcc-file-name`</dd>
<dt>
-print-search-dirs
</dt>
<dd>Print the name of the configured installation
directory and a list of program and library directories <strong>gcc</strong>
searches—and don&#39;t do anything else. This is useful when <strong>gcc</strong>
prints the error message <strong>installation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No
such file or directory</strong>. To resolve this you either need to put <em>cpp0</em>
and the other compiler components where <strong>gcc</strong> expects to find them, or
you can set the environment variable <strong>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</strong> to the
directory where you installed them. Don&#39;t forget the trailing <strong>/</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-print-sysroot
</dt>
<dd>Print the target sysroot directory that is used
during compilation. This is the target sysroot specified either at
configure time or using the <strong>–sysroot</strong> option, possibly with an extra
suffix that depends on compilation options. If no target sysroot is
specified, the option prints nothing.</dd>
<dt>
-print-sysroot-headers-suffix
</dt>
<dd>Print the suffix added to the target
sysroot when searching for headers, or give an error if the compiler
is not configured with such a suffix—and don&#39;t do anything else.</dd>
<dt>
-dumpmachine
</dt>
<dd>Print the compiler&#39;s target machine (for example,
<strong>i686-pc-linux-gnu</strong>)—and don&#39;t do anything else.</dd>
<dt>
-dumpversion
</dt>
<dd>Print the compiler version (for example, <code class="verbatim">3.0</code>,
<code class="verbatim">6.3.0</code> or <code class="verbatim">7</code>)—and don&#39;t do anything else. This is the compiler
version used in filesystem paths and specs. Depending on how the
compiler has been configured it can be just a single number (major
version), two numbers separated by a dot (major and minor version) or
three numbers separated by dots (major, minor and patchlevel version).</dd>
<dt>
-dumpfullversion
</dt>
<dd>Print the full compiler version—and don&#39;t do
anything else. The output is always three numbers separated by dots,
major, minor and patchlevel version.</dd>
<dt>
-dumpspecs
</dt>
<dd>Print the compiler&#39;s built-in specs—and don&#39;t do
anything else. (This is used when GCC itself is being built.)</dd>

32 bits, but long int and pointers are 64 bits. The default depends on
the specific target configuration. Note that the LP64 and ILP32 ABIs
are not link-compatible; you must compile your entire program with the
same ABI, and link with a compatible set of libraries.</dd>

load/store-exclusive instructions that are present in the base ARMv8.0
ISA. This option is only applicable when compiling for the base ARMv8.0
instruction set. If using a later revision, e.g. <strong>-march=armv8.1-a</strong> or
<strong>-march=armv8-a+lse</strong>, the ARMv8.1-Atomics instructions will be used
directly. The same applies when using <strong>-mcpu=</strong> when the selected cpu
supports the <strong>lse</strong> feature. This option is on by default.</p>

<p>The value <strong>native</strong> is available on native AArch64 GNU/Linux and causes

<strong>cortex-a73.cortex-a35</strong>, <strong>cortex-a73.cortex-a53</strong>,
<strong>cortex-a75.cortex-a55</strong>, <strong>cortex-a76.cortex-a55</strong> specify that GCC
should tune for a big.LITTLE system. The value <strong>neoverse-512tvb</strong>
specifies that GCC should tune for Neoverse cores that (a) implement
SVE and (b) have a total vector bandwidth of 512 bits per cycle. In
other words, the option tells GCC to tune for Neoverse cores that can
execute 4 128-bit Advanced SIMD arithmetic instructions a cycle and
that can execute an equivalent number of SVE arithmetic instructions
per cycle (2 for 256-bit SVE, 4 for 128-bit SVE). This is more general
than tuning for a specific core like Neoverse V1 but is more specific
than the default tuning described below. Additionally on native
AArch64 GNU/Linux systems the value <strong>native</strong> tunes performance to the
host system. This option has no effect if the compiler is unable to
recognize the processor of the host system. Where none of <strong>-mtune=</strong>,
<strong>-mcpu=</strong> or <strong>-march=</strong> are specified, the code is tuned to perform well
across a range of target processors. This option cannot be suffixed by
feature modifiers.</dd>
<dt>
-mcpu=name
</dt>
<dd>Specify the name of the target processor, optionally
suffixed by one or more feature modifiers. This option has the form
<strong>-mcpu=*/cpu/{*+</strong>[*no*]/feature/}*, where the permissible values for
<em>cpu</em> are the same as those available for <strong>-mtune</strong>. The permissible
values for <em>feature</em> are documented in the sub-section on
<strong>aarch64-feature-modifiers,,-march</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>-mcpu</strong> <strong>Feature Modifiers</strong>.
Where conflicting feature modifiers are specified, the right-most
feature is used. GCC uses <em>name</em> to determine what kind of
instructions it can emit when generating assembly code (as if by
<strong>-march</strong>) and to determine the target processor for which to tune for
performance (as if by <strong>-mtune</strong>). Where this option is used in
conjunction with <strong>-march</strong> or <strong>-mtune</strong>, those options take precedence
over the appropriate part of this option. <strong>-mcpu=neoverse-512tvb</strong> is
special in that it does not refer to a specific core, but instead
refers to all Neoverse cores that (a) implement SVE and (b) have a
total vector bandwidth of 512 bits a cycle. Unless overridden by
<strong>-march</strong>, <strong>-mcpu=neoverse-512tvb</strong> generates code that can run on a
Neoverse V1 core, since Neoverse V1 is the first Neoverse core with
these properties. Unless overridden by <strong>-mtune</strong>,
<strong>-mcpu=neoverse-512tvb</strong> tunes code in the same way as for
<strong>-mtune=neoverse-512tvb</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-moverride=string
</dt>
<dd>Override tuning decisions made by the back-end in
response to a <strong>-mtune=</strong> switch. The syntax, semantics, and accepted
values for <em>string</em> in this option are not guaranteed to be consistent
across releases. This option is only intended to be useful when
developing GCC.</dd>

enabled by default for <strong>-mcmodel=tiny</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-msign-return-address=scope
</dt>
<dd>Select the function scope on which
return address signing will be applied. Permissible values are <strong>none</strong>,
which disables return address signing, <strong>non-leaf</strong>, which enables
pointer signing for functions which are not leaf functions, and <strong>all</strong>,
which enables pointer signing for all functions. The default value is
<strong>none</strong>. This option has been deprecated by -mbranch-protection.</dd>
<dt>
-mbranch-protection=none|standard|pac-ret[+leaf+b-key]|bti
</dt>
<dd>Select
the branch protection features to use. <strong>none</strong> is the default and turns
off all types of branch protection. <strong>standard</strong> turns on all types of
branch protection features. If a feature has additional tuning
options, then <strong>standard</strong> sets it to its standard level.
<strong>pac-ret[+*/leaf/*]</strong> turns on return address signing to its standard
level: signing functions that save the return address to memory
(non-leaf functions will practically always do this) using the a-key.
The optional argument <strong>leaf</strong> can be used to extend the signing to
include leaf functions. The optional argument <strong>b-key</strong> can be used to
sign the functions with the B-key instead of the A-key. <strong>bti</strong> turns on
branch target identification mechanism.</dd>
<dt>
-mharden-sls=opts

<strong>-mharden-sls=none</strong> disables all SLS hardening.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-msve-vector-bits=bits
</dt>
<dd>Specify the number of bits in an SVE vector
register. This option only has an effect when SVE is enabled. GCC
supports two forms of SVE code generation: &#34;vector-length agnostic&#34;
output that works with any size of vector register and &#34;vector-length
specific&#34; output that allows GCC to make assumptions about the vector
length when it is useful for optimization reasons. The possible values
of <strong>bits</strong> are: <strong>scalable</strong>, <strong>128</strong>, <strong>256</strong>, <strong>512</strong>, <strong>1024</strong> and <strong>2048</strong>.
Specifying <strong>scalable</strong> selects vector-length agnostic output. At
present <strong>-msve-vector-bits=128</strong> also generates vector-length agnostic
output for big-endian targets. All other values generate vector-length
specific code. The behavior of these values may change in future
releases and no value except <strong>scalable</strong> should be relied on for
producing code that is portable across different hardware SVE vector
lengths. The default is <strong>-msve-vector-bits=scalable</strong>, which produces
vector-length agnostic code.</dd>

<em>Adapteva Epiphany Options</em></p>
<p>
These <strong>-m</strong> options are defined for Adapteva Epiphany:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mhalf-reg-file
</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t allocate any register in the range
<code class="verbatim">r32</code>…=r63=. That allows code to run on hardware variants that lack
these registers.</dd>
<dt>
-mprefer-short-insn-regs
</dt>
<dd>Preferentially allocate registers that
allow short instruction generation. This can result in increased
instruction count, so this may either reduce or increase overall code
size.</dd>
<dt>
-mbranch-cost=num
</dt>
<dd>Set the cost of branches to roughly <em>num</em>
&#34;simple&#34; instructions. This cost is only a heuristic and is not
guaranteed to produce consistent results across releases.</dd>
<dt>
-mcmove
</dt>
<dd>Enable the generation of conditional moves.</dd>
<dt>
-mnops=num
</dt>
<dd>Emit <em>num</em> NOPs before every other generated
instruction.</dd>
<dt>
-mno-soft-cmpsf
</dt>
<dd>For single-precision floating-point comparisons,
emit an <code class="verbatim">fsub</code> instruction and test the flags. This is faster than a
software comparison, but can get incorrect results in the presence of
NaNs, or when two different small numbers are compared such that their
difference is calculated as zero. The default is <strong>-msoft-cmpsf</strong>, which
uses slower, but IEEE-compliant, software comparisons.</dd>
<dt>
-mstack-offset=num
</dt>
<dd>Set the offset between the top of the stack and
the stack pointer. E.g., a value of 8 means that the eight bytes in
the range <code class="verbatim">sp+0...sp+7</code> can be used by leaf functions without stack
allocation. Values other than <strong>8</strong> or <strong>16</strong> are untested and unlikely to
work. Note also that this option changes the ABI; compiling a program
with a different stack offset than the libraries have been compiled
with generally does not work. This option can be useful if you want to
evaluate if a different stack offset would give you better code, but
to actually use a different stack offset to build working programs, it
is recommended to configure the toolchain with the appropriate
*–with-stack-offset=*/num/ option.</dd>
<dt>
-mno-round-nearest
</dt>
<dd>Make the scheduler assume that the rounding mode
has been set to truncating. The default is <strong>-mround-nearest</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-mlong-calls
</dt>
<dd>If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all
calls might be beyond the offset range of the <code class="verbatim">b</code> / <code class="verbatim">bl</code> instructions,
and therefore load the function address into a register before
performing a (otherwise direct) call. This is the default.</dd>
<dt>
-mshort-calls
</dt>
<dd>If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume
all direct calls are in the range of the <code class="verbatim">b</code> / <code class="verbatim">bl</code> instructions, so
use these instructions for direct calls. The default is
<strong>-mlong-calls</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-msmall16
</dt>
<dd>Assume addresses can be loaded as 16-bit unsigned values.
This does not apply to function addresses for which <strong>-mlong-calls</strong>
semantics are in effect.</dd>
<dt>
-mfp-mode=mode
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the prevailing mode of the floating-point unit.
This determines the floating-point mode that is provided and expected
at function call and return time. Making this mode match the mode you
predominantly need at function start can make your programs smaller
and faster by avoiding unnecessary mode switches. <em>mode</em> can be set to
one the following values:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
caller
</dt>
<dd>Any mode at function entry is valid, and retained or
restored when the function returns, and when it calls other
functions. This mode is useful for compiling libraries or other
compilation units you might want to incorporate into different
programs with different prevailing FPU modes, and the convenience of
being able to use a single object file outweighs the size and speed
overhead for any extra mode switching that might be needed, compared
with what would be needed with a more specific choice of prevailing
FPU mode.</dd>
<dt>
truncate
</dt>
<dd>This is the mode used for floating-point calculations
with truncating (i.e. round towards zero) rounding mode. That
includes conversion from floating point to integer.</dd>
<dt>
round-nearest
</dt>
<dd>This is the mode used for floating-point
calculations with round-to-nearest-or-even rounding mode.</dd>
<dt>
int
</dt>
<dd>This is the mode used to perform integer calculations in the
FPU, e.g. integer multiply, or integer multiply-and-accumulate.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The default is <strong>-mfp-mode=caller</strong></p>
</dd>
<dt>
-mno-split-lohi
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-mno-postinc
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-mno-postmodify
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Code generation tweaks that disable, respectively, splitting of 32-bit
loads, generation of post-increment addresses, and generation of
post-modify addresses. The defaults are <strong>msplit-lohi</strong>, <strong>-mpost-inc</strong>, and
<strong>-mpost-modify</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mnovect-double
</dt>
<dd>Change the preferred SIMD mode to SImode. The
default is <strong>-mvect-double</strong>, which uses DImode as preferred SIMD mode.</dd>
<dt>
-max-vect-align=num
</dt>
<dd>The maximum alignment for SIMD vector mode
types. <em>num</em> may be 4 or 8. The default is 8. Note that this is an ABI
change, even though many library function interfaces are unaffected if
they don&#39;t use SIMD vector modes in places that affect size and/or
alignment of relevant types.</dd>
<dt>
-msplit-vecmove-early
</dt>
<dd>Split vector moves into single word moves
before reload. In theory this can give better register allocation, but
so far the reverse seems to be generally the case.</dd>
<dt>
-m1reg-reg
</dt>
<dd>Specify a register to hold the constant -1, which makes
loading small negative constants and certain bitmasks faster.
Allowable values for <em>reg</em> are <strong>r43</strong> and <strong>r63</strong>, which specify use of
that register as a fixed register, and <strong>none</strong>, which means that no
register is used for this purpose. The default is <strong>-m1reg-none</strong>.</dd>

<dd>Specifies the number of registers
replicated in second register bank on entry to fast interrupt. Fast
interrupts are interrupts with the highest priority level P0. These
interrupts save only PC and STATUS32 registers to avoid memory
transactions during interrupt entry and exit sequences. Use this
option when you are using fast interrupts in an ARC V2 family
processor. Permitted values are 4, 8, 16, and 32.</dd>
<dt>
-mlpc-width=width
</dt>
<dd>Specify the width of the <code class="verbatim">lp_count</code> register.
Valid values for <em>width</em> are 8, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 bits. The
default width is fixed to 32 bits. If the width is less than 32, the
compiler does not attempt to transform loops in your program to use
the zero-delay loop mechanism unless it is known that the <code class="verbatim">lp_count</code>
register can hold the required loop-counter value. Depending on the
width specified, the compiler and run-time library might continue to
use the loop mechanism for various needs. This option defines macro
<code class="verbatim">_ _ARC_LPC_WIDTH_ _</code> with the value of <em>width</em>.</dd>

<dt>
-mlong-calls
</dt>
<dd>Generate calls as register indirect calls, thus
providing access to the full 32-bit address range.</dd>
<dt>
-mmedium-calls
</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t use less than 25-bit addressing range for
calls, which is the offset available for an unconditional
branch-and-link instruction. Conditional execution of function calls
is suppressed, to allow use of the 25-bit range, rather than the
21-bit range with conditional branch-and-link. This is the default for
tool chains built for <code class="verbatim">arc-linux-uclibc</code> and <code class="verbatim">arceb-linux-uclibc</code>
targets.</dd>
<dt>
-G num
</dt>
<dd>Put definitions of externally-visible data in a small data
section if that data is no bigger than <em>num</em> bytes. The default value
of <em>num</em> is 4 for any ARC configuration, or 8 when we have double
load/store operations.</dd>
<dt>

<dd>Enable the use of pre/post modify with register
displacement.</dd>
<dt>
-mbbit-peephole
</dt>
<dd>Enable bbit peephole2.</dd>
<dt>
-mno-brcc
</dt>
<dd>This option disables a target-specific pass in
<em>arc_reorg</em> to generate compare-and-branch (=br=/=cc=/) instructions.
It has no effect on generation of these instructions driven by the
combiner pass.</dd>
<dt>
-mcase-vector-pcrel
</dt>
<dd>Use PC-relative switch case tables to enable
case table shortening. This is the default for <strong>-Os</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-mcompact-casesi
</dt>
<dd>Enable compact <code class="verbatim">casesi</code> pattern. This is the
default for <strong>-Os</strong>, and only available for ARCv1 cores. This option is
deprecated.</dd>
<dt>
-mno-cond-exec
</dt>
<dd>Disable the ARCompact-specific pass to generate
conditional execution instructions. Due to delay slot scheduling and
interactions between operand numbers, literal sizes, instruction
lengths, and the support for conditional execution, the
target-independent pass to generate conditional execution is often
lacking, so the ARC port has kept a special pass around that tries to
find more conditional execution generation opportunities after
register allocation, branch shortening, and delay slot scheduling have
been done. This pass generally, but not always, improves performance
and code size, at the cost of extra compilation time, which is why
there is an option to switch it off. If you have a problem with call
instructions exceeding their allowable offset range because they are
conditionalized, you should consider using <strong>-mmedium-calls</strong> instead.</dd>
<dt>
-mearly-cbranchsi
</dt>
<dd>Enable pre-reload use of the <code class="verbatim">cbranchsi</code> pattern.</dd>
<dt>
-mexpand-adddi
</dt>
<dd>Expand <code class="verbatim">adddi3</code> and <code class="verbatim">subdi3</code> at RTL generation time
into <code class="verbatim">add.f</code>, <code class="verbatim">adc</code> etc. This option is deprecated.</dd>
<dt>
-mindexed-loads
</dt>
<dd>Enable the use of indexed loads. This can be
problematic because some optimizers then assume that indexed stores
exist, which is not the case.</dd>
<dt>
-mlra
</dt>
<dd>Enable Local Register Allocation. This is still experimental
for ARC, so by default the compiler uses standard reload (i.e.
<strong>-mno-lra</strong>).</dd>
<dt>
-mlra-priority-none
</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t indicate any priority for target
registers.</dd>
<dt>
-mlra-priority-compact

<dt>
-mlra-priority-noncompact
</dt>
<dd>Reduce target register priority for
r0..r3 / r12..r15.</dd>
<dt>
-mmillicode
</dt>
<dd>When optimizing for size (using <strong>-Os</strong>), prologues and
epilogues that have to save or restore a large number of registers are
often shortened by using call to a special function in libgcc; this is
referred to as a <em>millicode</em> call. As these calls can pose performance
issues, and/or cause linking issues when linking in a nonstandard way,
this option is provided to turn on or off millicode call generation.</dd>
<dt>
-mcode-density-frame

<p><em>ARM Options</em></p>
<p>
These <strong>-m</strong> options are defined for the ARM port:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mabi=name
</dt>
<dd>Generate code for the specified ABI. Permissible values
are: <strong>apcs-gnu</strong>, <strong>atpcs</strong>, <strong>aapcs</strong>, <strong>aapcs-linux</strong> and <strong>iwmmxt</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-mapcs-frame
</dt>
<dd>Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the ARM
Procedure Call Standard for all functions, even if this is not
strictly necessary for correct execution of the code. Specifying
<strong>-fomit-frame-pointer</strong> with this option causes the stack frames not to
be generated for leaf functions. The default is <strong>-mno-apcs-frame</strong>.
This option is deprecated.</dd>
<dt>
-mapcs
</dt>
<dd>This is a synonym for <strong>-mapcs-frame</strong> and is deprecated.</dd>
<dt>
-mthumb-interwork
</dt>
<dd>Generate code that supports calling between the
ARM and Thumb instruction sets. Without this option, on pre-v5
architectures, the two instruction sets cannot be reliably used inside
one program. The default is <strong>-mno-thumb-interwork</strong>, since slightly
larger code is generated when <strong>-mthumb-interwork</strong> is specified. In
AAPCS configurations this option is meaningless.</dd>
<dt>
-mno-sched-prolog
</dt>
<dd>Prevent the reordering of instructions in the
function prologue, or the merging of those instruction with the
instructions in the function&#39;s body. This means that all functions
start with a recognizable set of instructions (or in fact one of a
choice from a small set of different function prologues), and this
information can be used to locate the start of functions inside an
executable piece of code. The default is <strong>-msched-prolog</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-mfloat-abi=name
</dt>
<dd>Specifies which floating-point ABI to use.
Permissible values are: <strong>soft</strong>, <strong>softfp</strong> and <strong>hard</strong>. Specifying <strong>soft</strong>
causes GCC to generate output containing library calls for
floating-point operations. <strong>softfp</strong> allows the generation of code
using hardware floating-point instructions, but still uses the
soft-float calling conventions. <strong>hard</strong> allows generation of
floating-point instructions and uses FPU-specific calling conventions.
The default depends on the specific target configuration. Note that
the hard-float and soft-float ABIs are not link-compatible; you must
compile your entire program with the same ABI, and link with a
compatible set of libraries.</dd>
<dt>
-mgeneral-regs-only
</dt>
<dd>Generate code which uses only the
general-purpose registers. This will prevent the compiler from using
floating-point and Advanced SIMD registers but will not impose any
restrictions on the assembler.</dd>
<dt>
-mlittle-endian
</dt>
<dd>Generate code for a processor running in
little-endian mode. This is the default for all standard
configurations.</dd>
<dt>
-mbig-endian
</dt>
<dd>Generate code for a processor running in big-endian
mode; the default is to compile code for a little-endian processor.</dd>
<dt>
-mbe8
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-mbe32
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>When linking a big-endian image select between BE8 and BE32 formats. The
option has no effect for little-endian images and is ignored. The
default is dependent on the selected target architecture. For ARMv6 and
later architectures the default is BE8, for older architectures the
default is BE32. BE32 format has been deprecated by ARM.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-march=name[+extension…]
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This specifies the name of the target
ARM architecture. GCC uses this name to determine what kind of
instructions it can emit when generating assembly code. This option
can be used in conjunction with or instead of the <strong>-mcpu=</strong> option.
Permissible names are: <strong>armv4t</strong>, <strong>armv5t</strong>, <strong>armv5te</strong>, <strong>armv6</strong>,
<strong>armv6j</strong>, <strong>armv6k</strong>, <strong>armv6kz</strong>, <strong>armv6t2</strong>, <strong>armv6z</strong>, <strong>armv6zk</strong>,
<strong>armv7</strong>, <strong>armv7-a</strong>, <strong>armv7ve</strong>, <strong>armv8-a</strong>, <strong>armv8.1-a</strong>, <strong>armv8.2-a</strong>,
<strong>armv8.3-a</strong>, <strong>armv8.4-a</strong>, <strong>armv8.5-a</strong>, <strong>armv8.6-a</strong>, <strong>armv9-a</strong>,
<strong>armv7-r</strong>, <strong>armv8-r</strong>, <strong>armv6-m</strong>, <strong>armv6s-m</strong>, <strong>armv7-m</strong>, <strong>armv7e-m</strong>,
<strong>armv8-m.base</strong>, <strong>armv8-m.main</strong>, <strong>armv8.1-m.main</strong>, <strong>armv9-a</strong>, <strong>iwmmxt</strong>
and <strong>iwmmxt2</strong>. Additionally, the following architectures, which lack
support for the Thumb execution state, are recognized but support is
deprecated: <strong>armv4</strong>. Many of the architectures support extensions.
These can be added by appending *+*/extension/ to the architecture
name. Extension options are processed in order and capabilities
accumulate. An extension will also enable any necessary base
extensions upon which it depends. For example, the <strong>+crypto</strong> extension
will always enable the <strong>+simd</strong> extension. The exception to the
additive construction is for extensions that are prefixed with
<strong>+no…</strong>: these extensions disable the specified option and any other
extensions that may depend on the presence of that extension. For
example, <strong>-march=armv7-a+simd+nofp+vfpv4</strong> is equivalent to writing
<strong>-march=armv7-a+vfpv4</strong> since the <strong>+simd</strong> option is entirely disabled
by the <strong>+nofp</strong> option that follows it. Most extension names are
generically named, but have an effect that is dependent upon the
architecture to which it is applied. For example, the <strong>+simd</strong> option
can be applied to both <strong>armv7-a</strong> and <strong>armv8-a</strong> architectures, but will
enable the original ARMv7-A Advanced SIMD (Neon) extensions for
<strong>armv7-a</strong> and the ARMv8-A variant for <strong>armv8-a</strong>. The table below lists
the supported extensions for each architecture. Architectures not
mentioned do not support any extensions.</p>

the performance of the code for a big.LITTLE system. Permissible names
are: <strong>cortex-a15.cortex-a7</strong>, <strong>cortex-a17.cortex-a7</strong>,
<strong>cortex-a57.cortex-a53</strong>, <strong>cortex-a72.cortex-a53</strong>,

<strong>cortex-a75.cortex-a55</strong>, <strong>cortex-a76.cortex-a55</strong>.
*-mtune=generic-*/arch/ specifies that GCC should tune the performance
for a blend of processors within architecture <em>arch</em>. The aim is to
generate code that run well on the current most popular processors,
balancing between optimizations that benefit some CPUs in the range,
and avoiding performance pitfalls of other CPUs. The effects of this
option may change in future GCC versions as CPU models come and go.
<strong>-mtune</strong> permits the same extension options as <strong>-mcpu</strong>, but the
extension options do not affect the tuning of the generated code.
<strong>-mtune=native</strong> causes the compiler to auto-detect the CPU of the
build computer. At present, this feature is only supported on
GNU/Linux, and not all architectures are recognized. If the
auto-detect is unsuccessful the option has no effect.</dd>
<dt>
-mcpu=name[+extension…]
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This specifies the name of the target ARM
processor. GCC uses this name to derive the name of the target ARM
architecture (as if specified by <strong>-march</strong>) and the ARM processor type
for which to tune for performance (as if specified by <strong>-mtune</strong>). Where
this option is used in conjunction with <strong>-march</strong> or <strong>-mtune</strong>, those
options take precedence over the appropriate part of this option. Many
of the supported CPUs implement optional architectural extensions.
Where this is so the architectural extensions are normally enabled by
default. If implementations that lack the extension exist, then the
extension syntax can be used to disable those extensions that have
been omitted. For floating-point and Advanced SIMD (Neon)
instructions, the settings of the options <strong>-mfloat-abi</strong> and <strong>-mfpu</strong>
must also be considered: floating-point and Advanced SIMD instructions
will only be used if <strong>-mfloat-abi</strong> is not set to <strong>soft</strong>; and any
setting of <strong>-mfpu</strong> other than <strong>auto</strong> will override the available
floating-point and SIMD extension instructions. For example,
<strong>cortex-a9</strong> can be found in three major configurations: integer only,
with just a floating-point unit or with floating-point and Advanced
SIMD. The default is to enable all the instructions, but the
extensions <strong>+nosimd</strong> and <strong>+nofp</strong> can be used to disable just the SIMD
or both the SIMD and floating-point instructions respectively.
Permissible names for this option are the same as those for <strong>-mtune</strong>.
The following extension options are common to the listed CPUs:</p>

<p>Additionally the <strong>generic-armv7-a</strong> pseudo target defaults to VFPv3
with 16 double-precision registers. It supports the following
extension options: <strong>mp</strong>, <strong>sec</strong>, <strong>vfpv3-d16</strong>, <strong>vfpv3</strong>,
<strong>vfpv3-d16-fp16</strong>, <strong>vfpv3-fp16</strong>, <strong>vfpv4-d16</strong>, <strong>vfpv4</strong>, <strong>neon</strong>,
<strong>neon-vfpv3</strong>, <strong>neon-fp16</strong>, <strong>neon-vfpv4</strong>. The meanings are the same as
for the extensions to <strong>-march=armv7-a</strong>. *-mcpu=generic-*/arch/ is also
permissible, and is equivalent to <strong>-march=*/arch/
*-mtune=generic-*/arch/. See *-mtune</strong> for more information.
<strong>-mcpu=native</strong> causes the compiler to auto-detect the CPU of the build
computer. At present, this feature is only supported on GNU/Linux, and
not all architectures are recognized. If the auto-detect is
unsuccessful the option has no effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-mfpu=name
</dt>
<dd>This specifies what floating-point hardware (or hardware
emulation) is available on the target. Permissible names are: <strong>auto</strong>,
<strong>vfpv2</strong>, <strong>vfpv3</strong>, <strong>vfpv3-fp16</strong>, <strong>vfpv3-d16</strong>, <strong>vfpv3-d16-fp16</strong>,
<strong>vfpv3xd</strong>, <strong>vfpv3xd-fp16</strong>, <strong>neon-vfpv3</strong>, <strong>neon-fp16</strong>, <strong>vfpv4</strong>,
<strong>vfpv4-d16</strong>, <strong>fpv4-sp-d16</strong>, <strong>neon-vfpv4</strong>, <strong>fpv5-d16</strong>, <strong>fpv5-sp-d16</strong>,
<strong>fp-armv8</strong>, <strong>neon-fp-armv8</strong> and <strong>crypto-neon-fp-armv8</strong>. Note that
<strong>neon</strong> is an alias for <strong>neon-vfpv3</strong> and <strong>vfp</strong> is an alias for <strong>vfpv2</strong>.
The setting <strong>auto</strong> is the default and is special. It causes the
compiler to select the floating-point and Advanced SIMD instructions
based on the settings of <strong>-mcpu</strong> and <strong>-march</strong>. If the selected
floating-point hardware includes the NEON extension (e.g.
<strong>-mfpu=neon</strong>), note that floating-point operations are not generated
by GCC&#39;s auto-vectorization pass unless <strong>-funsafe-math-optimizations</strong>
is also specified. This is because NEON hardware does not fully
implement the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic (in
particular denormal values are treated as zero), so the use of NEON
instructions may lead to a loss of precision. You can also set the fpu
name at function level by using the <code class="verbatim">target(&#34;fpu</code>&#34;)= function
attributes or pragmas.</dd>
<dt>
-mfp16-format=name
</dt>
<dd>Specify the format of the <code class="verbatim">_ _fp16</code>
half-precision floating-point type. Permissible names are <strong>none</strong>,
<strong>ieee</strong>, and <strong>alternative</strong>; the default is <strong>none</strong>, in which case the
<code class="verbatim">_ _fp16</code> type is not defined.</dd>
<dt>
-mstructure-size-boundary=n
</dt>
<dd>The sizes of all structures and unions
are rounded up to a multiple of the number of bits set by this option.
Permissible values are 8, 32 and 64. The default value varies for
different toolchains. For the COFF targeted toolchain the default
value is 8. A value of 64 is only allowed if the underlying ABI
supports it. Specifying a larger number can produce faster, more
efficient code, but can also increase the size of the program.
Different values are potentially incompatible. Code compiled with one
value cannot necessarily expect to work with code or libraries
compiled with another value, if they exchange information using
structures or unions. This option is deprecated.</dd>
<dt>
-mabort-on-noreturn
</dt>
<dd>Generate a call to the function <code class="verbatim">abort</code> at the
end of a <code class="verbatim">noreturn</code> function. It is executed if the function tries to
return.</dd>
<dt>
-mlong-calls
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-mno-long-calls
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
address of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register. This switch is needed if the target function lies
outside of the 64-megabyte addressing range of the offset-based version
of subroutine call instruction. Even if this switch is enabled, not all
function calls are turned into long calls. The heuristic is that static
functions, functions that have the <code class="verbatim">short_call</code> attribute, functions
that are inside the scope of a <code class="verbatim">#pragma no_long_calls</code> directive, and
functions whose definitions have already been compiled within the
current compilation unit are not turned into long calls. The exceptions
to this rule are that weak function definitions, functions with the
<code class="verbatim">long_call</code> attribute or the <code class="verbatim">section</code> attribute, and functions that are
within the scope of a <code class="verbatim">#pragma long_calls</code> directive are always turned
into long calls. This feature is not enabled by default. Specifying
<strong>-mno-long-calls</strong> restores the default behavior, as does placing the
function calls within the scope of a <code class="verbatim">#pragma</code> long_calls_off directive.
Note these switches have no effect on how the compiler generates code to
handle function calls via function pointers.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-msingle-pic-base
</dt>
<dd>Treat the register used for PIC addressing as
read-only, rather than loading it in the prologue for each function.
The runtime system is responsible for initializing this register with
an appropriate value before execution begins.</dd>
<dt>
-mpic-register=reg
</dt>
<dd>Specify the register to be used for PIC
addressing. For standard PIC base case, the default is any suitable
register determined by compiler. For single PIC base case, the default
is <strong>R9</strong> if target is EABI based or stack-checking is enabled,
otherwise the default is <strong>R10</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-mpic-data-is-text-relative
</dt>
<dd>Assume that the displacement between
the text and data segments is fixed at static link time. This permits
using PC-relative addressing operations to access data known to be in
the data segment. For non-VxWorks RTP targets, this option is enabled
by default. When disabled on such targets, it will enable
<strong>-msingle-pic-base</strong> by default.</dd>
<dt>
-mpoke-function-name
</dt>
<dd>Write the name of each function into the text
section, directly preceding the function prologue. The generated code
is similar to this: t0 .ascii &#34;arm_poke_function_name&#34;, 0 .align t1
.word 0xff000000 + (t1 - t0) arm_poke_function_name mov ip, sp stmfd
sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc} sub fp, ip, #4 When performing a stack
backtrace, code can inspect the value of <code class="verbatim">pc</code> stored at <code class="verbatim">fp + 0</code>. If
the trace function then looks at location <code class="verbatim">pc - 12</code> and the top 8 bits
are set, then we know that there is a function name embedded
immediately preceding this location and has length
<code class="verbatim">((pc[-3]) &amp; 0xff000000)</code>.</dd>

</dl>
<p>Select between generating code that executes in ARM and Thumb states.
The default for most configurations is to generate code that executes in
ARM state, but the default can be changed by configuring GCC with the
*–with-mode=*/state/ configure option. You can also override the ARM
and Thumb mode for each function by using the <code class="verbatim">target(&#34;thumb&#34;)</code> and
<code class="verbatim">target(&#34;arm&#34;)</code> function attributes or pragmas.</p>
<dl>

generation, and is not intended for ordinary use in compiling code.</dd>
<dt>
-mtpcs-frame
</dt>
<dd>Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the
Thumb Procedure Call Standard for all non-leaf functions. (A leaf
function is one that does not call any other functions.) The default
is <strong>-mno-tpcs-frame</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-mtpcs-leaf-frame
</dt>
<dd>Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the
Thumb Procedure Call Standard for all leaf functions. (A leaf function
is one that does not call any other functions.) The default is
<strong>-mno-apcs-leaf-frame</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-mcallee-super-interworking
</dt>
<dd>Gives all externally visible functions
in the file being compiled an ARM instruction set header which
switches to Thumb mode before executing the rest of the function. This
allows these functions to be called from non-interworking code. This
option is not valid in AAPCS configurations because interworking is
enabled by default.</dd>
<dt>
-mcaller-super-interworking
</dt>
<dd>Allows calls via function pointers
(including virtual functions) to execute correctly regardless of
whether the target code has been compiled for interworking or not.
There is a small overhead in the cost of executing a function pointer
if this option is enabled. This option is not valid in AAPCS
configurations because interworking is enabled by default.</dd>
<dt>
-mtp=name
</dt>
<dd>Specify the access model for the thread local storage
pointer. The valid models are <strong>soft</strong>, which generates calls to
<code class="verbatim">_ _aeabi_read_tp</code>, <strong>cp15</strong>, which fetches the thread pointer from
<code class="verbatim">cp15</code> directly (supported in the arm6k architecture), and <strong>auto</strong>,
which uses the best available method for the selected processor. The
default setting is <strong>auto</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-mtls-dialect=dialect
</dt>
<dd>Specify the dialect to use for accessing
thread local storage. Two /dialect/s are supported—<strong>gnu</strong> and <strong>gnu2</strong>.
The <strong>gnu</strong> dialect selects the original GNU scheme for supporting local
and global dynamic TLS models. The <strong>gnu2</strong> dialect selects the GNU
descriptor scheme, which provides better performance for shared
libraries. The GNU descriptor scheme is compatible with the original
scheme, but does require new assembler, linker and library support.
Initial and local exec TLS models are unaffected by this option and
always use the original scheme.</dd>
<dt>
-mword-relocations
</dt>
<dd>Only generate absolute relocations on word-sized
values (i.e. R_ARM_ABS32). This is enabled by default on targets

access is disabled for all pre-ARMv6, all ARMv6-M and for ARMv8-M
Baseline architectures, and enabled for all other architectures. If
unaligned access is not enabled then words in packed data structures are
accessed a byte at a time. The ARM attribute <code class="verbatim">Tag_CPU_unaligned_access</code>
is set in the generated object file to either true or false, depending
upon the setting of this option. If unaligned access is enabled then the

features, and the user should explicitly provide the PIC/PIE-related
options as needed. Note that static linking is not supported because it
would still involve the dynamic linker when the program self-relocates.
If such behavior is acceptable, use -static and -Wl,-dynamic-linker
options. The opposite <strong>-mno-fdpic</strong> option is useful (and required) to
build the Linux kernel using the same (<code class="verbatim">arm-*-uclinuxfdpiceabi</code>)
toolchain as the one used to build the userland programs.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mbranch-protection=none|standard|pac-ret[+leaf][+bti]|bti[+pac-ret[+leaf]]
</dt>
<dd>Enable
branch protection features (armv8.1-m.main only). <strong>none</strong> generate code
without branch protection or return address signing.
<strong>standard[+*/leaf/*]</strong> generate code with all branch protection
features enabled at their standard level. <strong>pac-ret[+*/leaf/*]</strong>
generate code with return address signing set to its standard level,
which is to sign all functions that save the return address to memory.
<strong>leaf</strong> When return address signing is enabled, also sign leaf
functions even if they do not write the return address to memory.
+*bti* Add landing-pad instructions at the permitted targets of
indirect branch instructions. If the <strong>+pacbti</strong> architecture extension
is not enabled, then all branch protection and return address signing
operations are constrained to use only the instructions defined in the
architectural-NOP space. The generated code will remain
backwards-compatible with earlier versions of the architecture, but
the additional security can be enabled at run time on processors that
support the <strong>PACBTI</strong> extension. Branch target enforcement using BTI
can only be enabled at runtime if all code in the application has been
compiled with at least <strong>-mbranch-protection=bti</strong>. Any setting other
than <strong>none</strong> is supported only on armv8-m.main or later. The default is
to generate code without branch protection or return address signing.</dd>

<dd>
<p>Specify the AVR instruction set architecture (ISA) or
device type. The default for this option is <code class="verbatim">avr2</code>. The following AVR
devices and ISAs are supported. <em>Note:</em> A complete device support
consists of startup code <code class="verbatim">crt=/=mcu=/</code>.o=, a device header

(<code class="verbatim">https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/avr-gcc#spec-files</code>) file =specs-=/=mcu=/.
Only the latter is provided by the compiler according the supported

Jump relaxing is performed by the linker because jump offsets are not
known before code is located. Therefore, the assembler code generated
by the compiler is the same, but the instructions in the executable

<p><code class="verbatim">EIND</code> and Devices with More Than 128 Ki Bytes of Flash</p>
<p>
Pointers in the implementation are 16 bits wide. The address of a
function or label is represented as word address so that indirect jumps
and calls can target any code address in the range of 64 Ki words.</p>
<p>
In order to facilitate indirect jump on devices with more than 128 Ki
bytes of program memory space, there is a special function register
called <code class="verbatim">EIND</code> that serves as most significant part of the target address
when <code class="verbatim">EICALL</code> or <code class="verbatim">EIJMP</code> instructions are used.</p>
<p>
Indirect jumps and calls on these devices are handled as follows by the
compiler and are subject to some limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The compiler never sets <code class="verbatim">EIND</code>.</li>
<li>The compiler uses <code class="verbatim">EIND</code> implicitly in <code class="verbatim">EICALL=/=EIJMP</code> instructions
or might read <code class="verbatim">EIND</code> directly in order to emulate an indirect
call/jump by means of a <code class="verbatim">RET</code> instruction.</li>
<li>The compiler assumes that <code class="verbatim">EIND</code> never changes during the startup code
or during the application. In particular, <code class="verbatim">EIND</code> is not saved/restored
in function or interrupt service routine prologue/epilogue.</li>
<li>For indirect calls to functions and computed goto, the linker
generates <em>stubs</em>. Stubs are jump pads sometimes also called
<em>trampolines</em>. Thus, the indirect call/jump jumps to such a stub. The
stub contains a direct jump to the desired address.</li>
<li>Linker relaxation must be turned on so that the linker generates the
stubs correctly in all situations. See the compiler option <strong>-mrelax</strong>
and the linker option <strong>–relax</strong>. There are corner cases where the
linker is supposed to generate stubs but aborts without relaxation and
without a helpful error message.</li>
<li>The default linker script is arranged for code with <code class="verbatim">EIND = 0</code>. If
code is supposed to work for a setup with <code class="verbatim">EIND !</code> 0=, a custom linker
script has to be used in order to place the sections whose name start
with <code class="verbatim">.trampolines</code> into the segment where <code class="verbatim">EIND</code> points to.</li>
<li>The startup code from libgcc never sets <code class="verbatim">EIND</code>. Notice that startup
code is a blend of code from libgcc and AVR-LibC. For the impact of
AVR-LibC on <code class="verbatim">EIND</code>, see the AVR-LibC user manual
(<code class="verbatim">https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/</code>).</li>
<li>It is legitimate for user-specific startup code to set up <code class="verbatim">EIND</code>
early, for example by means of initialization code located in section
<code class="verbatim">.init3</code>. Such code runs prior to general startup code that
initializes RAM and calls constructors, but after the bit of startup
code from AVR-LibC that sets <code class="verbatim">EIND</code> to the segment where the vector
table is located. #include &lt;avr/io.h&gt; static void
_ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">attribute</span> _((section(&#34;.init3&#34;),naked,used,no_instrument_function))
init3_set_eind (void) { _ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">asm volatile (&#34;ldi
r24,pm_hh8(</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">trampolines_start)\n\t&#34; &#34;out %i0,r24&#34; :: &#34;n&#34; (&amp;EIND) :
&#34;r24&#34;,&#34;memory&#34;); } The =</span> _trampolines_start= symbol is defined in the
linker script.</li>
<li>
<p>Stubs are generated automatically by the linker if the following two
conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>-&lt;The address of a label is taken by means of the &#34;gs&#34;
modifier&gt; :: (short for <em>generate stubs</em>) like so: LDI r24,
lo8(gs(&lt;func&gt;)) LDI r25, hi8(gs(&lt;func&gt;))</li>
<li>-&lt;The final location of that label is in a code
segment&gt; :: <em>outside</em> the segment where the stubs are located.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The compiler emits such <code class="verbatim">gs</code> modifiers for code labels in the
following situations:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-&lt;Taking address of a function or code label.&gt;
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-&lt;Computed goto.&gt;
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-&lt;If prologue-save function is used, see -mcall-prologues&gt;
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>command-line option.</p>
<ul>
<li>-&lt;Switch/case dispatch tables. If you do not want such
dispatch&gt; :: tables you can specify the <strong>-fno-jump-tables</strong>
command-line option.</li>
<li>-&lt;C and C++ constructors/destructors called during
startup/shutdown.&gt; :: </li>
<li>-&lt;If the tools hit a gs() modifier explained above.&gt; :: </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Jumping to non-symbolic addresses like so is <em>not</em> supported: int main
(void) { <em>* Call function at word address 0x2 *</em> return ((int(*)(void))
0x2)(); } Instead, a stub has to be set up, i.e. the function has to be
called through a symbol (<code class="verbatim">func_4</code> in the example): int main (void) {
extern int func_4 (void); <em>* Call function at byte address 0x4 *</em> return
func_4(); } and the application be linked with
<strong>-Wl,–defsym,func_4=0x4</strong>. Alternatively, <code class="verbatim">func_4</code> can be defined in the
linker script.</p>
<p>
Handling of the <code class="verbatim">RAMPD</code>, <code class="verbatim">RAMPX</code>, <code class="verbatim">RAMPY</code> and <code class="verbatim">RAMPZ</code> Special Function
Registers</p>
<p>
Some AVR devices support memories larger than the 64 KiB range that can
be accessed with 16-bit pointers. To access memory locations outside
this 64 KiB range, the content of a <code class="verbatim">RAMP</code> register is used as high part
of the address: The <code class="verbatim">X</code>, <code class="verbatim">Y</code>, <code class="verbatim">Z</code> address register is concatenated with
the <code class="verbatim">RAMPX</code>, <code class="verbatim">RAMPY</code>, <code class="verbatim">RAMPZ</code> special function register, respectively,
to get a wide address. Similarly, <code class="verbatim">RAMPD</code> is used together with direct
addressing.</p>
<ul>
<li>The startup code initializes the <code class="verbatim">RAMP</code> special function registers
with zero.</li>
<li>If a <strong>AVR Named Address Spaces,named address space</strong> other than generic
or <code class="verbatim">_ _flash</code> is used, then <code class="verbatim">RAMPZ</code> is set as needed before the
operation.</li>
<li>If the device supports RAM larger than 64 KiB and the compiler needs
to change <code class="verbatim">RAMPZ</code> to accomplish an operation, <code class="verbatim">RAMPZ</code> is reset to zero
after the operation.</li>
<li>If the device comes with a specific <code class="verbatim">RAMP</code> register, the ISR
prologue/epilogue saves/restores that SFR and initializes it with zero
in case the ISR code might (implicitly) use it.</li>
<li>RAM larger than 64 KiB is not supported by GCC for AVR targets. If you
use inline assembler to read from locations outside the 16-bit address
range and change one of the <code class="verbatim">RAMP</code> registers, you must reset it to
zero after the access.</li>
</ul>
<p>AVR Built-in Macros</p>
<p>
GCC defines several built-in macros so that the user code can test for
the presence or absence of features. Almost any of the following
built-in macros are deduced from device capabilities and thus triggered
by the <strong>-mmcu=</strong> command-line option.</p>

Spaces</strong> and <strong>AVR Built-in Functions</strong>.</p>

<strong>bf544m</strong>, <strong>bf547m</strong>, <strong>bf548m</strong>, <strong>bf549m</strong>, <strong>bf561</strong>, <strong>bf592</strong>. The optional
<em>sirevision</em> specifies the silicon revision of the target Blackfin
processor. Any workarounds available for the targeted silicon revision
are enabled. If <em>sirevision</em> is <strong>none</strong>, no workarounds are enabled. If
<em>sirevision</em> is <strong>any</strong>, all workarounds for the targeted processor are
enabled. The <code class="verbatim">_ _SILICON_REVISION_ _</code> macro is defined to two
hexadecimal digits representing the major and minor numbers in the
silicon revision. If <em>sirevision</em> is <strong>none</strong>, the
<code class="verbatim">_ _SILICON_REVISION_ _</code> is not defined. If <em>sirevision</em> is <strong>any</strong>, the
<code class="verbatim">_ _SILICON_REVISION_ _</code> is defined to be <code class="verbatim">0xffff</code>. If this optional
<em>sirevision</em> is not used, GCC assumes the latest known silicon
revision of the targeted Blackfin processor. GCC defines a
preprocessor macro for the specified <em>cpu</em>. For the <strong>bfin-elf</strong>
toolchain, this option causes the hardware BSP provided by libgloss to
be linked in if <strong>-msim</strong> is not given. Without this option, <strong>bf532</strong> is
used as the processor by default. Note that support for <strong>bf561</strong> is
incomplete. For <strong>bf561</strong>, only the preprocessor macro is defined.</dd>
<dt>
-msim
</dt>
<dd>Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator. This
causes the simulator BSP provided by libgloss to be linked in. This
option has effect only for <strong>bfin-elf</strong> toolchain. Certain other
options, such as <strong>-mid-shared-library</strong> and <strong>-mfdpic</strong>, imply <strong>-msim</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-momit-leaf-frame-pointer
</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t keep the frame pointer in a
register for leaf functions. This avoids the instructions to save, set
up and restore frame pointers and makes an extra register available in
leaf functions.</dd>
<dt>
-mspecld-anomaly
</dt>
<dd>When enabled, the compiler ensures that the
generated code does not contain speculative loads after jump
instructions. If this option is used,

<dt>
-mno-specld-anomaly
</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t generate extra code to prevent
speculative loads from occurring.</dd>
<dt>
-mcsync-anomaly

<dd>Do stack checking using information placed into L1
scratchpad memory by the uClinux kernel.</dd>
<dt>
-mid-shared-library
</dt>
<dd>Generate code that supports shared libraries
via the library ID method. This allows for execute in place and shared
libraries in an environment without virtual memory management. This
option implies <strong>-fPIC</strong>. With a <strong>bfin-elf</strong> target, this option implies
<strong>-msim</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-mno-id-shared-library
</dt>
<dd>Generate code that doesn&#39;t assume ID-based
shared libraries are being used. This is the default.</dd>
<dt>
-mleaf-id-shared-library
</dt>
<dd>Generate code that supports shared
libraries via the library ID method, but assumes that this library or
executable won&#39;t link against any other ID shared libraries. That
allows the compiler to use faster code for jumps and calls.</dd>
<dt>
-mno-leaf-id-shared-library
</dt>
<dd>Do not assume that the code being
compiled won&#39;t link against any ID shared libraries. Slower code is
generated for jump and call insns.</dd>
<dt>
-mshared-library-id=n
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the identification number of the
ID-based shared library being compiled. Specifying a value of 0
generates more compact code; specifying other values forces the
allocation of that number to the current library but is no more space-
or time-efficient than omitting this option.</dd>
<dt>
-msep-data
</dt>
<dd>Generate code that allows the data segment to be located
in a different area of memory from the text segment. This allows for
execute in place in an environment without virtual memory management
by eliminating relocations against the text section.</dd>
<dt>

call on this register. This switch is needed if the target function lies
outside of the 24-bit addressing range of the offset-based version of
subroutine call instruction. This feature is not enabled by default.
Specifying <strong>-mno-long-calls</strong> restores the default behavior. Note these
switches have no effect on how the compiler generates code to handle
function calls via function pointers.</p>

should be used instead of <code class="verbatim">main</code>. This option can only be used in
conjunction with <strong>-mmulticore</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-msdram
</dt>
<dd>Build a standalone application for SDRAM. Proper start

<p><em>Darwin Options</em></p>
<p>
These options are defined for all architectures running the Darwin
operating system.</p>
<p>
FSF GCC on Darwin does not create &#34;fat&#34; object files; it creates an
object file for the single architecture that GCC was built to target.
Apple&#39;s GCC on Darwin does create &#34;fat&#34; files if multiple <strong>-arch</strong>
options are used; it does so by running the compiler or linker multiple
times and joining the results together with <em>lipo</em>.</p>
<p>
The subtype of the file created (like <strong>ppc7400</strong> or <strong>ppc970</strong> or <strong>i686</strong>)
is determined by the flags that specify the ISA that GCC is targeting,
like <strong>-mcpu</strong> or <strong>-march</strong>. The <strong>-force_cpusubtype_ALL</strong> option can be used
to override this.</p>
<p>
The Darwin tools vary in their behavior when presented with an ISA
mismatch. The assembler, <em>as</em>, only permits instructions to be used that
are valid for the subtype of the file it is generating, so you cannot
put 64-bit instructions in a <strong>ppc750</strong> object file. The linker for shared
libraries, <em>/usr/bin/libtool</em>, fails and prints an error if asked to
create a shared library with a less restrictive subtype than its input
files (for instance, trying to put a <strong>ppc970</strong> object file in a <strong>ppc7400</strong>
library). The linker for executables, <strong>ld</strong>, quietly gives the executable
the most restrictive subtype of any of its input files.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-Fdir
</dt>
<dd>Add the framework directory <em>dir</em> to the head of the list of
directories to be searched for header files. These directories are
interleaved with those specified by <strong>-I</strong> options and are scanned in a
left-to-right order. A framework directory is a directory with
frameworks in it. A framework is a directory with a <em>Headers</em> and/or
<em>PrivateHeaders</em> directory contained directly in it that ends in
<em>.framework</em>. The name of a framework is the name of this directory
excluding the <em>.framework</em>. Headers associated with the framework are
found in one of those two directories, with <em>Headers</em> being searched
first. A subframework is a framework directory that is in a
framework&#39;s <em>Frameworks</em> directory. Includes of subframework headers
can only appear in a header of a framework that contains the
subframework, or in a sibling subframework header. Two subframeworks
are siblings if they occur in the same framework. A subframework
should not have the same name as a framework; a warning is issued if
this is violated. Currently a subframework cannot have subframeworks;
in the future, the mechanism may be extended to support this. The
standard frameworks can be found in <em>/System/Library/Frameworks</em> and
<em>/Library/Frameworks</em>. An example include looks like
<code class="verbatim">#include &lt;Framework/header.h&gt;</code>, where <em>Framework</em> denotes the name of
the framework and <em>header.h</em> is found in the <em>PrivateHeaders</em> or
<em>Headers</em> directory.</dd>

<p>These options are passed to the Darwin linker. The Darwin linker man

<p>
<em>DEC Alpha Options</em></p>
<p>
These <strong>-m</strong> options are defined for the DEC Alpha implementations:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mno-soft-float
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-msoft-float
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
floating-point operations. When <strong>-msoft-float</strong> is specified, functions
in <em>libgcc.a</em> are used to perform floating-point operations. Unless they
are replaced by routines that emulate the floating-point operations, or
compiled in such a way as to call such emulations routines, these
routines issue floating-point operations. If you are compiling for an
Alpha without floating-point operations, you must ensure that the
library is built so as not to call them. Note that Alpha implementations
without floating-point operations are required to have floating-point
registers.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mfp-reg
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-mno-fp-regs
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register set.
<strong>-mno-fp-regs</strong> implies <strong>-msoft-float</strong>. If the floating-point register
set is not used, floating-point operands are passed in integer registers
as if they were integers and floating-point results are passed in <code class="verbatim">$0</code>
instead of <code class="verbatim">$f0</code>. This is a non-standard calling sequence, so any
function with a floating-point argument or return value called by code
compiled with <strong>-mno-fp-regs</strong> must also be compiled with that option. A
typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not use, and
hence need not save and restore, any floating-point registers.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mieee
</dt>
<dd>The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware
optimized for maximum performance. It is mostly compliant with the
IEEE floating-point standard. However, for full compliance, software
assistance is required. This option generates code fully
IEEE-compliant code <em>except</em> that the <em>inexact-flag</em> is not maintained
(see below). If this option is turned on, the preprocessor macro
<code class="verbatim">_IEEE_FP</code> is defined during compilation. The resulting code is less
efficient but is able to correctly support denormalized numbers and
exceptional IEEE values such as not-a-number and plus/minus infinity.
Other Alpha compilers call this option <strong>-ieee_with_no_inexact</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-mieee-with-inexact
</dt>
<dd>This is like <strong>-mieee</strong> except the generated code
also maintains the IEEE <em>inexact-flag</em>. Turning on this option causes
the generated code to implement fully-compliant IEEE math. In addition
to <code class="verbatim">_IEEE_FP</code>, <code class="verbatim">_IEEE_FP_EXACT</code> is defined as a preprocessor macro. On
some Alpha implementations the resulting code may execute
significantly slower than the code generated by default. Since there
is very little code that depends on the <em>inexact-flag</em>, you should
normally not specify this option. Other Alpha compilers call this
option <strong>-ieee_with_inexact</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-mfp-trap-mode=trap-mode
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option controls what floating-point
related traps are enabled. Other Alpha compilers call this option
<strong>-fptm</strong> <em>trap-mode</em>. The trap mode can be set to one of four values:</p>
<ol>
<li value="14">This is the default (normal) setting. The only traps that
are enabled are the ones that cannot be disabled in software
(e.g., division by zero trap).</li>
<li>In addition to the traps enabled by <strong>n</strong>, underflow traps are
enabled as well.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>
su
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>u</strong>, but the instructions are marked to be safe for
software completion (see Alpha architecture manual for details).</dd>
<dt>
sui
</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>su</strong>, but inexact traps are enabled as well.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
-mfp-rounding-mode=rounding-mode
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Selects the IEEE rounding mode.
Other Alpha compilers call this option <strong>-fprm</strong> <em>rounding-mode</em>. The
<em>rounding-mode</em> can be one of:</p>
<ol>
<li value="14">Normal IEEE rounding mode. Floating-point numbers are
rounded towards the nearest machine number or towards the even
machine number in case of a tie.</li>
<li>Round towards minus infinity.</li>
<li>Chopped rounding mode. Floating-point numbers are rounded towards
zero.</li>
<li>Dynamic rounding mode. A field in the floating-point control
register (<em>fpcr</em>, see Alpha architecture reference manual)
controls the rounding mode in effect. The C library initializes
this register for rounding towards plus infinity. Thus, unless
your program modifies the <em>fpcr</em>, <strong>d</strong> corresponds to round towards
plus infinity.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>
-mtrap-precision=trap-precision
</dt>
<dd>
<p>In the Alpha architecture,
floating-point traps are imprecise. This means without software
assistance it is impossible to recover from a floating trap and
program execution normally needs to be terminated. GCC can generate
code that can assist operating system trap handlers in determining the
exact location that caused a floating-point trap. Depending on the
requirements of an application, different levels of precisions can be
selected:</p>
<ol>
<li value="16">Program precision. This option is the default and means a
trap handler can only identify which program caused a
floating-point exception.</li>
<li>Function precision. The trap handler can determine the function
that caused a floating-point exception.</li>
<li>Instruction precision. The trap handler can determine the exact
instruction that caused a floating-point exception.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other Alpha compilers provide the equivalent options called
<strong>-scope_safe</strong> and <strong>-resumption_safe</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-mieee-conformant
</dt>
<dd>This option marks the generated code as IEEE
conformant. You must not use this option unless you also specify
<strong>-mtrap-precision=i</strong> and either <strong>-mfp-trap-mode=su</strong> or
<strong>-mfp-trap-mode=sui</strong>. Its only effect is to emit the line <strong>.eflag 48</strong>
in the function prologue of the generated assembly file.</dd>
<dt>
-mbuild-constants
</dt>
<dd>Normally GCC examines a 32- or 64-bit integer
constant to see if it can construct it from smaller constants in two
or three instructions. If it cannot, it outputs the constant as a
literal and generates code to load it from the data segment at run
time. Use this option to require GCC to construct <em>all</em> integer
constants using code, even if it takes more instructions (the maximum
is six). You typically use this option to build a shared library
dynamic loader. Itself a shared library, it must relocate itself in
memory before it can find the variables and constants in its own data
segment.</dd>

<p>Older Alpha assemblers provided no way to generate symbol relocations
except via assembler macros. Use of these macros does not allow optimal
instruction scheduling. GNU binutils as of version 2.12 supports a new
syntax that allows the compiler to explicitly mark which relocations
should apply to which instructions. This option is mostly useful for
debugging, as GCC detects the capabilities of the assembler when it is
built and sets the default accordingly.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-msmall-data
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-mlarge-data
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>When <strong>-mexplicit-relocs</strong> is in effect, static data is accessed via
<em>gp-relative</em> relocations. When <strong>-msmall-data</strong> is used, objects 8 bytes
long or smaller are placed in a <em>small data area</em> (the <code class="verbatim">.sdata</code> and
<code class="verbatim">.sbss</code> sections) and are accessed via 16-bit relocations off of the
<code class="verbatim">$gp</code> register. This limits the size of the small data area to 64KB, but
allows the variables to be directly accessed via a single instruction.
The default is <strong>-mlarge-data</strong>. With this option the data area is limited
to just below 2GB. Programs that require more than 2GB of data must use
<code class="verbatim">malloc</code> or <code class="verbatim">mmap</code> to allocate the data in the heap instead of in the
program&#39;s data segment. When generating code for shared libraries,
<strong>-fpic</strong> implies <strong>-msmall-data</strong> and <strong>-fPIC</strong> implies <strong>-mlarge-data</strong>.</p>
<dl>

-msmall-text
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-mlarge-text
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>When <strong>-msmall-text</strong> is used, the compiler assumes that the code of the
entire program (or shared library) fits in 4MB, and is thus reachable
with a branch instruction. When <strong>-msmall-data</strong> is used, the compiler can
assume that all local symbols share the same <code class="verbatim">$gp</code> value, and thus
reduce the number of instructions required for a function call from 4
to 1. The default is <strong>-mlarge-text</strong>.</p>

<dt>
-mfdpic
</dt>
<dd>Select the FDPIC ABI, which uses function descriptors to
represent pointers to functions. Without any PIC/PIE-related options,
it implies <strong>-fPIE</strong>. With <strong>-fpic</strong> or <strong>-fpie</strong>, it assumes GOT entries
and small data are within a 12-bit range from the GOT base address;
with <strong>-fPIC</strong> or <strong>-fPIE</strong>, GOT offsets are computed with 32 bits. With a
<strong>bfin-elf</strong> target, this option implies <strong>-msim</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-minline-plt
</dt>
<dd>Enable inlining of PLT entries in function calls to
functions that are not known to bind locally. It has no effect without
<strong>-mfdpic</strong>. It&#39;s enabled by default if optimizing for speed and
compiling for shared libraries (i.e., <strong>-fPIC</strong> or <strong>-fpic</strong>), or when an

<dt>
-mgprel-ro
</dt>
<dd>Enable the use of <code class="verbatim">GPREL</code> relocations in the FDPIC ABI
for data that is known to be in read-only sections. It&#39;s enabled by
default, except for <strong>-fpic</strong> or <strong>-fpie</strong>: even though it may help make
the global offset table smaller, it trades 1 instruction for 4. With
<strong>-fPIC</strong> or <strong>-fPIE</strong>, it trades 3 instructions for 4, one of which may
be shared by multiple symbols, and it avoids the need for a GOT entry
for the referenced symbol, so it&#39;s more likely to be a win. If it is
not, <strong>-mno-gprel-ro</strong> can be used to disable it.</dd>
<dt>
-multilib-library-pic
</dt>
<dd>Link with the (library, not FD) pic

<dl>
<dt>
-matomic-libcalls
</dt>
<dd>Generate libcalls for atomic loads and stores
when sync libcalls are disabled. This option is enabled by default. It
only affects the generation of atomic libcalls by the HPPA backend.
Both the sync and <em>libatomic</em> libcall implementations use locking. As
a result, processor stores are not atomic with respect to other atomic
operations. Processor loads up to DImode are atomic with respect to
other atomic operations provided they are implemented as a single
access. The PA-RISC architecture does not support any atomic
operations in hardware except for the <code class="verbatim">ldcw</code> instruction. Thus, all
atomic support is implemented using sync and atomic libcalls. Sync
libcall support is in <em>libgcc.a</em>. Atomic libcall support is in
<em>libatomic</em>. This option generates <code class="verbatim">_ _atomic_exchange</code> calls for
atomic stores. It also provides special handling for atomic DImode
accesses on 32-bit targets.</dd>
<dt>
-mbig-switch
</dt>
<dd>Does nothing. Preserved for backward compatibility.</dd>
<dt>
-mcaller-copies
</dt>
<dd>The caller copies function arguments passed by
hidden reference. This option should be used with care as it is not
compatible with the default 32-bit runtime. However, only aggregates
larger than eight bytes are passed by hidden reference and the option
provides better compatibility with OpenMP.</dd>
<dt>
-mcoherent-ldcw
</dt>
<dd>Use ldcw/ldcd coherent cache-control hint.</dd>
<dt>
-mdisable-fpregs
</dt>
<dd>Disable floating-point registers. Equivalent to
<code class="verbatim">-msoft-float</code>.</dd>
<dt>
-mdisable-indexing
</dt>
<dd>Prevent the compiler from using indexing address
modes. This avoids some rather obscure problems when compiling MIG
generated code under MACH.</dd>
<dt>
-mfast-indirect-calls
</dt>
<dd>Generate code that assumes calls never cross
space boundaries. This allows GCC to emit code that performs faster
indirect calls. This option does not work in the presence of shared
libraries or nested functions.</dd>
<dt>
-mfixed-range=register-range
</dt>
<dd>Generate code treating the given
register range as fixed registers. A fixed register is one that the
register allocator cannot use. This is useful when compiling kernel
code. A register range is specified as two registers separated by a
dash. Multiple register ranges can be specified separated by a comma.</dd>
<dt>
-mgas
</dt>
<dd>Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS understands.</dd>
<dt>
-mgnu-ld
</dt>
<dd>Use options specific to GNU <strong>ld</strong>. This passes <strong>-shared</strong> to
<strong>ld</strong> when building a shared library. It is the default when GCC is
configured, explicitly or implicitly, with the GNU linker. This option
does not affect which <strong>ld</strong> is called; it only changes what parameters
are passed to that <strong>ld</strong>. The <strong>ld</strong> that is called is determined by the
<strong>–with-ld</strong> configure option, GCC&#39;s program search path, and finally
by the user&#39;s <strong>PATH</strong>. The linker used by GCC can be printed using
<strong>which `gcc -print-prog-name=ld`</strong>. This option is only available on
the 64-bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with <strong>hppa*64</strong>-<strong>-hpux*</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-mhp-ld
</dt>
<dd>Use options specific to HP <strong>ld</strong>. This passes <strong>-b</strong> to <strong>ld</strong>
when building a shared library and passes <strong>+Accept TypeMismatch</strong> to
<strong>ld</strong> on all links. It is the default when GCC is configured,
explicitly or implicitly, with the HP linker. This option does not
affect which <strong>ld</strong> is called; it only changes what parameters are
passed to that <strong>ld</strong>. The <strong>ld</strong> that is called is determined by the
<strong>–with-ld</strong> configure option, GCC&#39;s program search path, and finally
by the user&#39;s <strong>PATH</strong>. The linker used by GCC can be printed using
<strong>which</strong> `gcc -print-prog-name=ld`. This option is only available on
the 64-bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with <strong>hppa*64</strong>-<strong>-hpux*</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-mlinker-opt
</dt>
<dd>Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX linker. Note
this makes symbolic debugging impossible. It also triggers a bug in
the HP-UX 8 and HP-UX 9 linkers in which they give bogus error
messages when linking some programs.</dd>
<dt>
-mlong-calls
</dt>
<dd>Generate code that uses long call sequences. This
ensures that a call is always able to reach linker generated stubs.
The default is to generate long calls only when the distance from the
call site to the beginning of the function or translation unit, as the
case may be, exceeds a predefined limit set by the branch type being
used. The limits for normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes,
respectively for the PA 2.0 and PA 1.X architectures. Sibcalls are
always limited at 240,000 bytes. Distances are measured from the
beginning of functions when using the <strong>-ffunction-sections</strong> option, or
when using the <strong>-mgas</strong> and <strong>-mno-portable-runtime</strong> options together
under HP-UX with the SOM linker. It is normally not desirable to use
this option as it degrades performance. However, it may be useful in
large applications, particularly when partial linking is used to build
the application. The types of long calls used depends on the
capabilities of the assembler and linker, and the type of code being
generated. The impact on systems that support long absolute calls, and
long pic symbol-difference or pc-relative calls should be relatively
small. However, an indirect call is used on 32-bit ELF systems in pic
code and it is quite long.</dd>
<dt>
-mlong-load-store
</dt>
<dd>Generate 3-instruction load and store sequences
as sometimes required by the HP-UX 10 linker. This is equivalent to
the <strong>+k</strong> option to the HP compilers.</dd>
<dt>
-mjump-in-delay
</dt>
<dd>This option is ignored and provided for
compatibility purposes only.</dd>
<dt>
-mno-space-regs
</dt>
<dd>Generate code that assumes the target has no space
registers. This allows GCC to generate faster indirect calls and use
unscaled index address modes. Such code is suitable for level 0 PA
systems and kernels.</dd>
<dt>
-mordered
</dt>
<dd>Assume memory references are ordered and barriers are not
needed.</dd>
<dt>
-mportable-runtime
</dt>
<dd>Use the portable calling conventions proposed by
HP for ELF systems.</dd>
<dt>
-mschedule=cpu-type
</dt>
<dd>Schedule code according to the constraints for
the machine type <em>cpu-type</em>. The choices for <em>cpu-type</em> are <strong>700</strong>
<strong>7100</strong>, <strong>7100LC</strong>, <strong>7200</strong>, <strong>7300</strong> and <strong>8000</strong>. Refer to
<em>/usr/lib/sched.models</em> on an HP-UX system to determine the proper
scheduling option for your machine. The default scheduling is <strong>8000</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-msio
</dt>
<dd>Generate the predefine, <code class="verbatim">_SIO</code>, for server IO. The default is
<strong>-mwsio</strong>. This generates the predefines, <code class="verbatim">_ _hp9000s700</code>,
<code class="verbatim">_ _hp9000s700_ _</code> and <code class="verbatim">_WSIO</code>, for workstation IO. These options are
available under HP-UX and HI-UX.</dd>
<dt>
-msoft-float
</dt>
<dd>Generate output containing library calls for floating
point. <strong>Warning:</strong> the requisite libraries are not available for all
HPPA targets. Normally the facilities of the machine&#39;s usual C
compiler are used, but this cannot be done directly in
cross-compilation. You must make your own arrangements to provide
suitable library functions for cross-compilation. <strong>-msoft-float</strong>
changes the calling convention in the output file; therefore, it is
only useful if you compile <em>all</em> of a program with this option. In
particular, you need to compile <em>libgcc.a</em>, the library that comes
with GCC, with <strong>-msoft-float</strong> in order for this to work.</dd>
<dt>
-msoft-mult
</dt>
<dd>Use software integer multiplication. This disables the
use of the <code class="verbatim">xmpyu</code> instruction.</dd>
<dt>
-munix=unix-std
</dt>
<dd>Generate compiler predefines and select a startfile
for the specified UNIX standard. The choices for <em>unix-std</em> are <strong>93</strong>,
<strong>95</strong> and <strong>98</strong>. <strong>93</strong> is supported on all HP-UX versions. <strong>95</strong> is
available on HP-UX 10.10 and later. <strong>98</strong> is available on HP-UX 11.11
and later. The default values are <strong>93</strong> for HP-UX 10.00, <strong>95</strong> for HP-UX
10.10 though to 11.00, and <strong>98</strong> for HP-UX 11.11 and later. <strong>-munix=93</strong>
provides the same predefines as GCC 3.3 and 3.4. <strong>-munix=95</strong> provides
additional predefines for <code class="verbatim">XOPEN_UNIX</code> and <code class="verbatim">_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</code>,
and the startfile <em>unix95.o</em>. <strong>-munix=98</strong> provides additional
predefines for <code class="verbatim">_XOPEN_UNIX</code>, <code class="verbatim">_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</code>,
<code class="verbatim">_INCLUDE_ _STDC_A1_SOURCE</code> and <code class="verbatim">_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_500</code>, and the
startfile <em>unix98.o</em>. It is <em>important</em> to note that this option
changes the interfaces for various library routines. It also affects
the operational behavior of the C library. Thus, <em>extreme</em> care is
needed in using this option. Library code that is intended to operate
with more than one UNIX standard must test, set and restore the
variable <code class="verbatim">_ _xpg4_extended_mask</code> as appropriate. Most GNU software
doesn&#39;t provide this capability.</dd>
<dt>
-nolibdld
</dt>
<dd>Suppress the generation of link options to search
libdld.sl when the <strong>-static</strong> option is specified on HP-UX 10 and
later.</dd>
<dt>
-static
</dt>
<dd>The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a
dependency on libdld.sl. There isn&#39;t an archive version of libdld.sl.
Thus, when the <strong>-static</strong> option is specified, special link options are
needed to resolve this dependency. On HP-UX 10 and later, the GCC
driver adds the necessary options to link with libdld.sl when the
<strong>-static</strong> option is specified. This causes the resulting binary to be
dynamic. On the 64-bit port, the linkers generate dynamic binaries by
default in any case. The <strong>-nolibdld</strong> option can be used to prevent the
GCC driver from adding these link options.</dd>
<dt>
-threads

<p><em>M680x0 Options</em></p>
<p>
These are the <strong>-m</strong> options defined for M680x0 and ColdFire processors.
The default settings depend on which architecture was selected when the
compiler was configured; the defaults for the most common choices are
given below.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-march=arch
</dt>
<dd>Generate code for a specific M680x0 or ColdFire
instruction set architecture. Permissible values of <em>arch</em> for M680x0
architectures are: <strong>68000</strong>, <strong>68010</strong>, <strong>68020</strong>, <strong>68030</strong>, <strong>68040</strong>,
<strong>68060</strong> and <strong>cpu32</strong>. ColdFire architectures are selected according to
Freescale&#39;s ISA classification and the permissible values are: <strong>isaa</strong>,
<strong>isaaplus</strong>, <strong>isab</strong> and <strong>isac</strong>. GCC defines a macro
<code class="verbatim">_ _mcf=/=arch=/=_ _</code> whenever it is generating code for a ColdFire
target. The <em>arch</em> in this macro is one of the <strong>-march</strong> arguments
given above. When used together, <strong>-march</strong> and <strong>-mtune</strong> select code
that runs on a family of similar processors but that is optimized for
a particular microarchitecture.</dd>
<dt>
-mcpu=cpu

<strong>68040</strong>, <strong>68060</strong>, <strong>68302</strong>, <strong>68332</strong> and <strong>cpu32</strong>. The ColdFire /cpu/s

<dd>Use a different function-calling convention, in which
functions that take a fixed number of arguments return with the <code class="verbatim">rtd</code>
instruction, which pops their arguments while returning. This saves
one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop the
arguments there. This calling convention is incompatible with the one
normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call
libraries compiled with the Unix compiler. Also, you must provide
function prototypes for all functions that take variable numbers of
arguments (including <code class="verbatim">printf</code>); otherwise incorrect code is generated
for calls to those functions. In addition, seriously incorrect code
results if you call a function with too many arguments. (Normally,
extra arguments are harmlessly ignored.) The <code class="verbatim">rtd</code> instruction is
supported by the 68010, 68020, 68030, 68040, 68060 and CPU32

(<strong>-malign-int</strong>) or a 16-bit boundary (<strong>-mno-align-int</strong>). Aligning
variables on 32-bit boundaries produces code that runs somewhat faster
on processors with 32-bit busses at the expense of more memory.
<strong>Warning:</strong> if you use the <strong>-malign-int</strong> switch, GCC aligns structures
containing the above types differently than most published application
binary interface specifications for the m68k. Use the pc-relative
addressing mode of the 68000 directly, instead of using a global offset
table. At present, this option implies <strong>-fpic</strong>, allowing at most a
16-bit offset for pc-relative addressing. <strong>-fPIC</strong> is not presently

</dl>
<p>When generating position-independent code for ColdFire, generate code
that works if the GOT has more than 8192 entries. This code is larger
and slower than code generated without this option. On M680x0
processors, this option is not needed; <strong>-fPIC</strong> suffices. GCC normally
uses a single instruction to load values from the GOT. While this is
relatively efficient, it only works if the GOT is smaller than about
64k. Anything larger causes the linker to report an error such as:
relocation truncated to fit: R_68K_GOT16O foobar If this happens, you
should recompile your code with <strong>-mxgot</strong>. It should then work with very
large GOTs. However, code generated with <strong>-mxgot</strong> is less efficient,
since it takes 4 instructions to fetch the value of a global symbol.
Note that some linkers, including newer versions of the GNU linker, can
create multiple GOTs and sort GOT entries. If you have such a linker,
you should only need to use <strong>-mxgot</strong> when compiling a single object file
that accesses more than 8192 GOT entries. Very few do. These options
have no effect unless GCC is generating position-independent code.</p>

most compatible architecture for the selected ABI (that is, <strong>mips1</strong>
for 32-bit ABIs and <strong>mips3</strong> for 64-bit ABIs). The native Linux/GNU
toolchain also supports the value <strong>native</strong>, which selects the best
architecture option for the host processor. <strong>-march=native</strong> has no
effect if GCC does not recognize the processor. In processor names, a
final <strong>000</strong> can be abbreviated as <strong>k</strong> (for example, <strong>-march=r2k</strong>).
Prefixes are optional, and <strong>vr</strong> may be written <strong>r</strong>. Names of the form
/n/*f2_1* refer to processors with FPUs clocked at half the rate of
the core, names of the form /n/*f1_1* refer to processors with FPUs
clocked at the same rate as the core, and names of the form /n/*f3_2*
refer to processors with FPUs clocked a ratio of 3:2 with respect to
the core. For compatibility reasons, /n/*f* is accepted as a synonym
for /n/*f2_1* while /n/*x* and /b/*fx* are accepted as synonyms for
/n/*f1_1*. GCC defines two macros based on the value of this option.
The first is <code class="verbatim">_MIPS_ARCH</code>, which gives the name of target
architecture, as a string. The second has the form
<code class="verbatim">_MIPS_ARCH_=/=foo=/, where /foo/ is the capitalized value of
=_MIPS_ARCH</code>. For example, <strong>-march=r2000</strong> sets <code class="verbatim">_MIPS_ARCH</code> to
<code class="verbatim">&#34;r2000&#34;</code> and defines the macro <code class="verbatim">_MIPS_ARCH_R2000</code>. Note that the
<code class="verbatim">_MIPS_ARCH</code> macro uses the processor names given above. In other
words, it has the full prefix and does not abbreviate <strong>000</strong> as <strong>k</strong>. In
the case of <strong>from-abi</strong>, the macro names the resolved architecture
(either <code class="verbatim">&#34;mips1&#34;</code> or <code class="verbatim">&#34;mips3&#34;</code>). It names the default architecture
when no <strong>-march</strong> option is given.</dd>
<dt>
-mtune=arch
</dt>
<dd>Optimize for <em>arch</em>. Among other things, this option
controls the way instructions are scheduled, and the perceived cost of
arithmetic operations. The list of <em>arch</em> values is the same as for
<strong>-march</strong>. When this option is not used, GCC optimizes for the
processor specified by <strong>-march</strong>. By using <strong>-march</strong> and <strong>-mtune</strong>
together, it is possible to generate code that runs on a family of
processors, but optimize the code for one particular member of that
family. <strong>-mtune</strong> defines the macros <code class="verbatim">_MIPS_TUNE</code> and
=_MIPS_TUNE_=/=foo=/, which work in the same way as the <strong>-march</strong> ones
described above.</dd>

<p>Generate code for the given ABI. Note that the EABI has a 32-bit and a
64-bit variant. GCC normally generates 64-bit code when you select a
64-bit architecture, but you can use <strong>-mgp32</strong> to get 32-bit code
instead. For information about the O64 ABI, see
&lt;*<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64-abi.html*">https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64-abi.html*</a>&gt;. GCC supports a
variant of the o32 ABI in which floating-point registers are 64 rather
than 32 bits wide. You can select this combination with <strong>-mabi=32</strong>
<strong>-mfp64</strong>. This ABI relies on the <code class="verbatim">mthc1</code> and <code class="verbatim">mfhc1</code> instructions and is
therefore only supported for MIPS32R2, MIPS32R3 and MIPS32R5 processors.
The register assignments for arguments and return values remain the
same, but each scalar value is passed in a single 64-bit register rather
than a pair of 32-bit registers. For example, scalar floating-point
values are returned in <strong><code class="verbatim">$f0</code></strong> only, not a <strong><code class="verbatim">$f0=*/*=$f1</code></strong> pair. The set
of call-saved registers also remains the same in that the even-numbered
double-precision registers are saved. Two additional variants of the o32
ABI are supported to enable a transition from 32-bit to 64-bit
registers. These are FPXX (<strong>-mfpxx</strong>) and FP64A (<strong>-mfp64</strong>
<strong>-mno-odd-spreg</strong>). The FPXX extension mandates that all code must
execute correctly when run using 32-bit or 64-bit registers. The code
can be interlinked with either FP32 or FP64, but not both. The FP64A
extension is similar to the FP64 extension but forbids the use of
odd-numbered single-precision registers. This can be used in conjunction
with the <code class="verbatim">FRE</code> mode of FPUs in MIPS32R5 processors and allows both FP32
and FP64A code to interlink and run in the same process without changing
FPU modes.</p>

<p>Generate (do not generate) code that is fully position-independent, and

affects <strong>-mabicalls</strong>. All <strong>-mabicalls</strong> code has traditionally been
position-independent, regardless of options like <strong>-fPIC</strong> and <strong>-fpic</strong>.
However, as an extension, the GNU toolchain allows executables to use
absolute accesses for locally-binding symbols. It can also use shorter
GP initialization sequences and generate direct calls to locally-defined
functions. This mode is selected by <strong>-mno-shared</strong>. <strong>-mno-shared</strong> depends
on binutils 2.16 or higher and generates objects that can only be linked
by the GNU linker. However, the option does not affect the ABI of the
final executable; it only affects the ABI of relocatable objects. Using
<strong>-mno-shared</strong> generally makes executables both smaller and quicker.
<strong>-mshared</strong> is the default.</p>

<p>Lift (do not lift) the usual restrictions on the size of the global
offset table. GCC normally uses a single instruction to load values from
the GOT. While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the GOT is
smaller than about 64k. Anything larger causes the linker to report an
error such as: relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_GOT16 foobar If this
happens, you should recompile your code with <strong>-mxgot</strong>. This works with
very large GOTs, although the code is also less efficient, since it
takes three instructions to fetch the value of a global symbol. Note
that some linkers can create multiple GOTs. If you have such a linker,
you should only need to use <strong>-mxgot</strong> when a single object file accesses
more than 64k&#39;s worth of GOT entries. Very few do. These options have no
effect unless GCC is generating position independent code.</p>

considered arithmetic and avoided where correct operation is required
and the input operand might be a NaN. A longer sequence of instructions
that manipulate the sign bit of floating-point datum manually is used
instead unless the <strong>-ffinite-math-only</strong> option has also been specified.
The <strong>-mabs=2008</strong> option selects the IEEE 754-2008 treatment. In this

<p>Assume (do not assume) that externally-defined data is in a small data
section if the size of that data is within the <strong>-G</strong> limit.
<strong>-mextern-sdata</strong> is the default for all configurations. If you compile a
module <em>Mod</em> with <strong>-mextern-sdata</strong> <strong>-G</strong> <em>num</em> <strong>-mgpopt</strong>, and <em>Mod</em>
references a variable <em>Var</em> that is no bigger than <em>num</em> bytes, you must
make sure that <em>Var</em> is placed in a small data section. If <em>Var</em> is
defined by another module, you must either compile that module with a
high-enough <strong>-G</strong> setting or attach a <code class="verbatim">section</code> attribute to <em>Var</em>&#39;s
definition. If <em>Var</em> is common, you must link the application with a
high-enough <strong>-G</strong> setting. The easiest way of satisfying these
restrictions is to compile and link every module with the same <strong>-G</strong>
option. However, you may wish to build a library that supports several
different small data limits. You can do this by compiling the library
with the highest supported <strong>-G</strong> setting and additionally using
<strong>-mno-extern-sdata</strong> to stop the library from making assumptions about
externally-defined data.</p>

-mr10k-cache-barrier=setting
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify whether GCC should insert
cache barriers to avoid the side effects of speculation on R10K
processors. In common with many processors, the R10K tries to predict
the outcome of a conditional branch and speculatively executes
instructions from the &#34;taken&#34; branch. It later aborts these
instructions if the predicted outcome is wrong. However, on the R10K,
even aborted instructions can have side effects. This problem only
affects kernel stores and, depending on the system, kernel loads. As
an example, a speculatively-executed store may load the target memory
into cache and mark the cache line as dirty, even if the store itself
is later aborted. If a DMA operation writes to the same area of memory
before the &#34;dirty&#34; line is flushed, the cached data overwrites the
DMA-ed data. See the R10K processor manual for a full description,
including other potential problems. One workaround is to insert cache
barrier instructions before every memory access that might be
speculatively executed and that might have side effects even if
aborted. *-mr10k-cache-barrier=*/setting/ controls GCC&#39;s
implementation of this workaround. It assumes that aborted accesses to
any byte in the following regions does not have side effects:</p>
<ol>
<li>the memory occupied by the current function&#39;s stack frame;</li>
<li>the memory occupied by an incoming stack argument;</li>
<li>the memory occupied by an object with a link-time-constant address.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is the kernel&#39;s responsibility to ensure that speculative accesses
to these regions are indeed safe. If the input program contains a
function declaration such as: void foo (void); then the implementation
of <code class="verbatim">foo</code> must allow <code class="verbatim">j foo</code> and <code class="verbatim">jal foo</code> to be executed
speculatively. GCC honors this restriction for functions it compiles
itself. It expects non-GCC functions (such as hand-written assembly
code) to do the same. The option has three forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mr10k-cache-barrier=load-store

<dd>Insert a cache barrier before a
load or store that might be speculatively executed and that might

MIPS16/microMIPS targets, it will be just ignored now. The behaviour for
MIPS16/microMIPS may change in future, since they do have some compact
branch instructions. The <strong>-mcompact-branches=optimal</strong> option will cause

These options are defined for the MSP430:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-masm-hex
</dt>
<dd>Force assembly output to always use hex constants.
Normally such constants are signed decimals, but this option is
available for testsuite and/or aesthetic purposes.</dd>
<dt>
-mmcu=
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Select the MCU to target. This is used to create a C
preprocessor symbol based upon the MCU name, converted to upper case
and pre- and post-fixed with <strong>_ _</strong>. This in turn is used by the
<em>msp430.h</em> header file to select an MCU-specific supplementary header
file. The option also sets the ISA to use. If the MCU name is one that
is known to only support the 430 ISA then that is selected, otherwise
the 430X ISA is selected. A generic MCU name of <strong>msp430</strong> can also be
used to select the 430 ISA. Similarly the generic <strong>msp430x</strong> MCU name
selects the 430X ISA. In addition an MCU-specific linker script is
added to the linker command line. The script&#39;s name is the name of the
MCU with <em>.ld</em> appended. Thus specifying <strong>-mmcu=xxx</strong> on the <strong>gcc</strong>
command line defines the C preprocessor symbol <code class="verbatim">_ _XXX_ _</code> and cause
the linker to search for a script called <em>xxx.ld</em>. The ISA and
hardware multiply supported for the different MCUs is hard-coded into
GCC. However, an external <strong>devices.csv</strong> file can be used to extend
device support beyond those that have been hard-coded. GCC searches
for the <strong>devices.csv</strong> file using the following methods in the given
precedence order, where the first method takes precendence over the
second which takes precedence over the third.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
Include path specified with &#34;-I&#34; and &#34;-L&#34;
</dt>
<dd><strong>devices.csv</strong> will be
searched for in each of the directories specified by include paths
and linker library search paths.</dd>
<dt>
?
</dt>
<dd>Path specified by the environment variable
MSP430_GCC_INCLUDE_DIR :: Define the value of the global environment
variable <strong>MSP430_GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</strong> to the full path to the directory
containing devices.csv, and GCC will search this directory for
devices.csv. If devices.csv is found, this directory will also be
registered as an include path, and linker library path. Header files
and linker scripts in this directory can therefore be used without
manually specifying <code class="verbatim">-I</code> and <code class="verbatim">-L</code> on the command line.</dd>
<dt>
The msp430-elf{,bare}/include/devices directory
</dt>
<dd>Finally, GCC will
examine <strong>msp430-elf{,bare}/include/devices</strong> from the toolchain root
directory. This directory does not exist in a default installation,
but if the user has created it and copied <strong>devices.csv</strong> there, then
the MCU data will be read. As above, this directory will also be
registered as an include path, and linker library path.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If none of the above search methods find <strong>devices.csv</strong>, then the
hard-coded MCU data is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-mwarn-mcu
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-mno-warn-mcu
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>This option enables or disables warnings about conflicts between the MCU
name specified by the <strong>-mmcu</strong> option and the ISA set by the <strong>-mcpu</strong>
option and/or the hardware multiply support set by the <strong>-mhwmult</strong>
option. It also toggles warnings about unrecognized MCU names. This
option is on by default.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mcpu=
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the ISA to use. Accepted values are <strong>msp430</strong>,
<strong>msp430x</strong> and <strong>msp430xv2</strong>. This option is deprecated. The <strong>-mmcu=</strong>
option should be used to select the ISA.</dd>
<dt>

<dd>Use large-model addressing (20-bit pointers, 20-bit
<code class="verbatim">size_t</code>).</dd>
<dt>
-msmall
</dt>
<dd>Use small-model addressing (16-bit pointers, 16-bit
<code class="verbatim">size_t</code>).</dd>
<dt>
-mrelax
</dt>
<dd>This option is passed to the assembler and linker, and
allows the linker to perform certain optimizations that cannot be done
until the final link.</dd>
<dt>
mhwmult=
</dt>
<dd>Describes the type of hardware multiply supported by the
target. Accepted values are <strong>none</strong> for no hardware multiply, <strong>16bit</strong>
for the original 16-bit-only multiply supported by early MCUs. <strong>32bit</strong>
for the 16/32-bit multiply supported by later MCUs and <strong>f5series</strong> for
the 16/32-bit multiply supported by F5-series MCUs. A value of <strong>auto</strong>
can also be given. This tells GCC to deduce the hardware multiply
support based upon the MCU name provided by the <strong>-mmcu</strong> option. If no
<strong>-mmcu</strong> option is specified or if the MCU name is not recognized then
no hardware multiply support is assumed. <code class="verbatim">auto</code> is the default
setting. Hardware multiplies are normally performed by calling a
library routine. This saves space in the generated code. When
compiling at <strong>-O3</strong> or higher however the hardware multiplier is
invoked inline. This makes for bigger, but faster code. The hardware
multiply routines disable interrupts whilst running and restore the
previous interrupt state when they finish. This makes them safe to use
inside interrupt handlers as well as in normal code.</dd>
<dt>
-minrt
</dt>
<dd>Enable the use of a minimum runtime environment - no static
initializers or constructors. This is intended for memory-constrained
devices. The compiler includes special symbols in some objects that
tell the linker and runtime which code fragments are required.</dd>
<dt>
-mtiny-printf
</dt>
<dd>Enable reduced code size <code class="verbatim">printf</code> and <code class="verbatim">puts</code> library
functions. The <strong>tiny</strong> implementations of these functions are not
reentrant, so must be used with caution in multi-threaded
applications. Support for streams has been removed and the string to
be printed will always be sent to stdout via the <code class="verbatim">write</code> syscall. The
string is not buffered before it is sent to write. This option
requires Newlib Nano IO, so GCC must be configured with
<strong>–enable-newlib-nano-formatted-io</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-mmax-inline-shift=
</dt>
<dd>This option takes an integer between 0 and 64
inclusive, and sets the maximum number of inline shift instructions
which should be emitted to perform a shift operation by a constant
amount. When this value needs to be exceeded, an mspabi helper
function is used instead. The default value is 4. This only affects
cases where a shift by multiple positions cannot be completed with a
single instruction (e.g. all shifts &gt;1 on the 430 ISA). Shifts of a
32-bit value are at least twice as costly, so the value passed for
this option is divided by 2 and the resulting value used instead.</dd>
<dt>
-mcode-region=
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-mdata-region=
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>These options tell the compiler where to place functions and data that
do not have one of the <code class="verbatim">lower</code>, <code class="verbatim">upper</code>, <code class="verbatim">either</code> or <code class="verbatim">section</code>
attributes. Possible values are <code class="verbatim">lower</code>, <code class="verbatim">upper</code>, <code class="verbatim">either</code> or <code class="verbatim">any</code>. The
first three behave like the corresponding attribute. The fourth possible
value - <code class="verbatim">any</code> - is the default. It leaves placement entirely up to the
linker script and how it assigns the standard sections (<code class="verbatim">.text</code>,
<code class="verbatim">.data</code>, etc) to the memory regions.</p>

register X. The other operand (or only operand of a unary operation) is
given to the custom arithmetic instruction with the least significant
half in source register <em>src1</em> and the most significant half in <em>src2</em>.
A custom instruction that returns a double-precision result returns the
most significant 32 bits in the destination register and the other half
in 32-bit register Y. GCC automatically generates the necessary code
sequences to write register X and/or read register Y when
double-precision floating-point instructions are used.</p>

maintained explicitly. This enables variable-length stack allocation
(with variable-length arrays or <code class="verbatim">alloca</code>), and when global memory is
used for underlying storage, makes it possible to access automatic
variables from other threads, or with atomic instructions. This code
generation variant is used for OpenMP offloading, but the option is

index equals the master lane index), and the register being assigned
is copied via a shuffle instruction from the master lane. Outside of
SIMD regions lane 0 is the master; inside, each thread sees itself as
the master. Shared memory array <code class="verbatim">int _ _nvptx_uni[]</code> stores all-zeros
or all-ones bitmasks for each warp, indicating current mode (0 outside

<em>PRU Options</em></p>
<p>
These command-line options are defined for PRU target:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-minrt
</dt>
<dd>Link with a minimum runtime environment, with no support for
static initializers and constructors. Using this option can
significantly reduce the size of the final ELF binary. Beware that the
compiler could still generate code with static initializers and
constructors. It is up to the programmer to ensure that the source
program will not use those features.</dd>
<dt>
-mmcu=mcu
</dt>
<dd>Specify the PRU MCU variant to use. Check Newlib for the
exact list of supported MCUs.</dd>
<dt>
-mno-relax
</dt>
<dd>Make GCC pass the <strong>–no-relax</strong> command-line option to
the linker instead of the <strong>–relax</strong> option.</dd>
<dt>
-mloop
</dt>
<dd>Allow (or do not allow) GCC to use the LOOP instruction.</dd>
<dt>
-mabi=variant
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the ABI variant to output code for.
<strong>-mabi=ti</strong> selects the unmodified TI ABI while <strong>-mabi=gnu</strong> selects a
GNU variant that copes more naturally with certain GCC assumptions.
These are the differences:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
Function Pointer Size
</dt>
<dd>TI ABI specifies that function (code)
pointers are 16-bit, whereas GNU supports only 32-bit data and code
pointers.</dd>
<dt>
Optional Return Value Pointer
</dt>
<dd>Function return values larger than
64 bits are passed by using a hidden pointer as the first argument
of the function. TI ABI, though, mandates that the pointer can be
NULL in case the caller is not using the returned value. GNU always
passes and expects a valid return value pointer.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The current <strong>-mabi=ti</strong> implementation simply raises a compile error
when any of the above code constructs is detected. As a consequence
the standard C library cannot be built and it is omitted when linking
with <strong>-mabi=ti</strong>. Relaxation is a GNU feature and for safety reasons is
disabled when using <strong>-mabi=ti</strong>. The TI toolchain does not emit
relocations for QBBx instructions, so the GNU linker cannot adjust
them when shortening adjacent LDI32 pseudo instructions.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>RISC-V Options</em></p>
<p>
These command-line options are defined for RISC-V targets:</p>

instructions.</dd>
<dt>
-mplt

</dl>
<p>When generating PIC code, do or don&#39;t allow the use of PLTs. Ignored for
non-PIC. The default is <strong>-mplt</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mabi=ABI-string
</dt>
<dd>Specify integer and floating-point calling
convention. <em>ABI-string</em> contains two parts: the size of integer types
and the registers used for floating-point types. For example
<strong>-march=rv64ifd -mabi=lp64d</strong> means that <strong>long</strong> and pointers are 64-bit
(implicitly defining <strong>int</strong> to be 32-bit), and that floating-point
values up to 64 bits wide are passed in F registers. Contrast this
with <strong>-march=rv64ifd -mabi=lp64f</strong>, which still allows the compiler to
generate code that uses the F and D extensions but only allows
floating-point values up to 32 bits long to be passed in registers; or
<strong>-march=rv64ifd -mabi=lp64</strong>, in which no floating-point arguments will
be passed in registers. The default for this argument is system
dependent, users who want a specific calling convention should specify
one explicitly. The valid calling conventions are: <strong>ilp32</strong>, <strong>ilp32f</strong>,
<strong>ilp32d</strong>, <strong>lp64</strong>, <strong>lp64f</strong>, and <strong>lp64d</strong>. Some calling conventions are
impossible to implement on some ISAs: for example, <strong>-march=rv32if
-mabi=ilp32d</strong> is invalid because the ABI requires 64-bit values be
passed in F registers, but F registers are only 32 bits wide. There is
also the <strong>ilp32e</strong> ABI that can only be used with the <strong>rv32e</strong>
architecture. This ABI is not well specified at present, and is
subject to change.</dd>

<li value="2">Produce code conforming to version 2.2.</li>
<li value="20190608">Produce code conforming to version 20190608.</li>
<li>Produce code conforming to version 20191213.</li>

</dd>
<dt>
-march=ISA-string
</dt>
<dd>Generate code for given RISC-V ISA (e.g.
<strong>rv64im</strong>). ISA strings must be lower-case. Examples include <strong>rv64i</strong>,
<strong>rv32g</strong>, <strong>rv32e</strong>, and <strong>rv32imaf</strong>. When <strong>-march=</strong> is not specified, use
the setting from <strong>-mcpu</strong>. If both <strong>-march</strong> and <strong>-mcpu=</strong> are not
specified, the default for this argument is system dependent, users
who want a specific architecture extensions should specify one
explicitly.</dd>
<dt>
-mcpu=processor-string
</dt>
<dd>Use architecture of and optimize the output

<dt>
-mtune=processor-string

Permissible values for this option are: <strong>rocket</strong>, <strong>sifive-3-series</strong>,
<strong>sifive-5-series</strong>, <strong>sifive-7-series</strong>, <strong>thead-c906</strong>, <strong>size</strong>, and all
valid options for <strong>-mcpu=</strong>. When <strong>-mtune=</strong> is not specified, use the
setting from <strong>-mcpu</strong>, the default is <strong>rocket</strong> if both are not
specified. The <strong>size</strong> choice is not intended for use by end-users.
This is used when <strong>-Os</strong> is specified. It overrides the instruction
cost info provided by <strong>-mtune=</strong>, but does not override the pipeline
info. This helps reduce code size while still giving good performance.</dd>
<dt>
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=num

the hardware multiply/divide peripheral found on the RL78/G13 (S2 core)
targets. The <code class="verbatim">g14</code> value selects the use of the multiplication and

<p>Specifies the RL78 core to target. The default is the G14 core, also
known as an S3 core or just RL78. The G13 or S2 core does not have
multiply or divide instructions, instead it uses a hardware peripheral
for these operations. The G10 or S1 core does not have register banks,
so it uses a different calling convention. If this option is set it also
selects the type of hardware multiply support to use, unless this is
overridden by an explicit <strong>-mmul=none</strong> option on the command line. Thus
specifying <strong>-mcpu=g13</strong> enables the use of the G13 hardware multiply
peripheral and specifying <strong>-mcpu=g10</strong> disables the use of hardware
multiplications altogether. Note, although the RL78/G14 core is the
default target, specifying <strong>-mcpu=g14</strong> or <strong>-mcpu=rl78</strong> on the command
line does change the behavior of the toolchain since it also enables G14
hardware multiply support. If these options are not specified on the
command line then software multiplication routines will be used even
though the code targets the RL78 core. This is for backwards
compatibility with older toolchains which did not have hardware multiply
and divide support. In addition a C preprocessor macro is defined, based
upon the setting of this option. Possible values are: <code class="verbatim">_ _RL78_G10_ _</code>,

target (S2 core). The MDUC registers will only be saved if the interrupt
handler performs a multiplication or division operation or it calls
another function.</p>

<p>You use these options to specify which instructions are available on the
processor you are using. The default value of these options is
determined when configuring GCC. Specifying the *-mcpu=*/cpu_type/
overrides the specification of these options. We recommend you use the
<strong>-mcpu=*/cpu_type/ option rather than the options listed above.
Specifying *-mpowerpc-gpopt</strong> allows GCC to use the optional PowerPC
architecture instructions in the General Purpose group, including
floating-point square root. Specifying <strong>-mpowerpc-gfxopt</strong> allows GCC to
use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the Graphics
group, including floating-point select. The <strong>-mmfcrf</strong> option allows GCC
to generate the move from condition register field instruction
implemented on the POWER4 processor and other processors that support
the PowerPC V2.01 architecture. The <strong>-mpopcntb</strong> option allows GCC to
generate the popcount and double-precision FP reciprocal estimate
instruction implemented on the POWER5 processor and other processors
that support the PowerPC V2.02 architecture. The <strong>-mpopcntd</strong> option
allows GCC to generate the popcount instruction implemented on the
POWER7 processor and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.06
architecture. The <strong>-mfprnd</strong> option allows GCC to generate the FP round
to integer instructions implemented on the POWER5+ processor and other
processors that support the PowerPC V2.03 architecture. The <strong>-mcmpb</strong>
option allows GCC to generate the compare bytes instruction implemented
on the POWER6 processor and other processors that support the PowerPC
V2.05 architecture. The <strong>-mhard-dfp</strong> option allows GCC to generate the
decimal floating-point instructions implemented on some POWER
processors. The <strong>-mpowerpc64</strong> option allows GCC to generate the
additional 64-bit instructions that are found in the full PowerPC64
architecture and to treat GPRs as 64-bit, doubleword quantities. GCC
defaults to <strong>-mno-powerpc64</strong>.</p>

<strong>-mcpu=powerpc</strong>, <strong>-mcpu=powerpc64</strong>, and <strong>-mcpu=powerpc64le</strong> specify
pure 32-bit PowerPC (either endian), 64-bit big endian PowerPC and
64-bit little endian PowerPC architecture machine types, with an
appropriate, generic processor model assumed for scheduling purposes.
Specifying <strong>native</strong> as cpu type detects and selects the architecture
option that corresponds to the host processor of the system performing
the compilation. <strong>-mcpu=native</strong> has no effect if GCC does not
recognize the processor. The other options specify a specific
processor. Code generated under those options runs best on that
processor, and may not run at all on others. The <strong>-mcpu</strong> options
automatically enable or disable the following options: <strong>-maltivec
-mfprnd -mhard-float -mmfcrf -mmultiple</strong> -mpopcntb -mpopcntd
-mpowerpc64 -mpowerpc-gpopt -mpowerpc-gfxopt -mmulhw -mdlmzb -mmfpgpr

-mquad-memory-atomic -mfloat128 -mfloat128-hardware -mprefixed -mpcrel
-mmma -mrop-protect The particular options set for any particular CPU
varies between compiler versions, depending on what setting seems to
produce optimal code for that CPU; it doesn&#39;t necessarily reflect the
actual hardware&#39;s capabilities. If you wish to set an individual
option to a particular value, you may specify it after the <strong>-mcpu</strong>
option, like <strong>-mcpu=970 -mno-altivec</strong>. On AIX, the <strong>-maltivec</strong> and
<strong>-mpowerpc64</strong> options are not enabled or disabled by the <strong>-mcpu</strong>

<p>Modify generation of the TOC (Table Of Contents), which is created for

In that case, GCC allocates at least one TOC entry for each unique
non-automatic variable reference in your program. GCC also places
floating-point constants in the TOC. However, only 16,384 entries are
available in the TOC. If you receive a linker error message that saying
you have overflowed the available TOC space, you can reduce the amount
of TOC space used with the <strong>-mno-fp-in-toc</strong> and <strong>-mno-sum-in-toc</strong>
options. <strong>-mno-fp-in-toc</strong> prevents GCC from putting floating-point
constants in the TOC and <strong>-mno-sum-in-toc</strong> forces GCC to generate code
to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at run time instead of
putting that sum into the TOC. You may specify one or both of these
options. Each causes GCC to produce very slightly slower and larger code
at the expense of conserving TOC space. If you still run out of space in
the TOC even when you specify both of these options, specify
<strong>-mminimal-toc</strong> instead. This option causes GCC to make only one TOC
entry for every file. When you specify this option, GCC produces code
that is slower and larger but which uses extremely little TOC space. You

128-bit long double value is properly rounded when comparing values and
converting to double. Use XL symbol names for long double support
routines. The AIX calling convention was extended but not initially
documented to handle an obscure K&amp;R C case of calling a function that
takes the address of its arguments with fewer arguments than declared.
IBM XL compilers access floating-point arguments that do not fit in the
RSA from the stack when a subroutine is compiled without optimization.
Because always storing floating-point arguments on the stack is

<p>By default assume that all calls are far away so that a longer and more
expensive calling sequence is required. This is required for calls
farther than 32 megabytes (33,554,432 bytes) from the current location.
A short call is generated if the compiler knows the call cannot be that
far away. This setting can be overridden by the <code class="verbatim">shortcall</code> function
attribute, or by <code class="verbatim">#pragma</code> longcall(0). Some linkers are capable of
detecting out-of-range calls and generating glue code on the fly. On
these systems, long calls are unnecessary and generate slower code. As
of this writing, the AIX linker can do this, as can the GNU linker for
PowerPC/64. It is planned to add this feature to the GNU linker for
32-bit PowerPC systems as well. On PowerPC64 ELFv2 and 32-bit PowerPC
systems with newer GNU linkers, GCC can generate long calls using an
inline PLT call sequence (see <strong>-mpltseq</strong>). PowerPC with <strong>-mbss-plt</strong> and
PowerPC64 ELFv1 (big-endian) do not support inline PLT calls. On
Darwin/PPC systems, <code class="verbatim">#pragma longcall</code> generates <code class="verbatim">jbsr</code> callee, L42,
plus a <em>branch island</em> (glue code). The two target addresses represent
the callee and the branch island. The Darwin/PPC linker prefers the
first address and generates a <code class="verbatim">bl</code> callee if the PPC <code class="verbatim">bl</code> instruction
reaches the callee directly; otherwise, the linker generates <code class="verbatim">bl L42</code> to
call the branch island. The branch island is appended to the body of the
calling function; it computes the full 32-bit address of the callee and
jumps to it. On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, this option directs the
compiler emit to the glue for every direct call, and the Darwin linker
decides whether to use or discard it. In the future, GCC may ignore all
longcall specifications when the linker is known to generate glue.</p>

the RX200 series. Floating-point instructions are only generated for
32-bit floating-point values, however, so the FPU hardware is not used
for doubles if the <strong>-m64bit-doubles</strong> option is used. <em>Note</em> If the

<dl>
<dt>
-msmall-data-limit=N
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the maximum size in bytes of global
and static variables which can be placed into the small data area.
Using the small data area can lead to smaller and faster code, but the
size of area is limited and it is up to the programmer to ensure that
the area does not overflow. Also when the small data area is used one
of the RX&#39;s registers (usually <code class="verbatim">r13</code>) is reserved for use pointing to
this area, so it is no longer available for use by the compiler. This
could result in slower and/or larger code if variables are pushed onto
the stack instead of being held in this register. Note, common
variables (variables that have not been initialized) and constants are
not placed into the small data area as they are assigned to other
sections in the output executable. The default value is zero, which
disables this feature. Note, this feature is not enabled by default
with higher optimization levels (<strong>-O2</strong> etc) because of the potentially
detrimental effects of reserving a register. It is up to the
programmer to experiment and discover whether this feature is of
benefit to their program. See the description of the <strong>-mpid</strong> option
for a description of how the actual register to hold the small data
area pointer is chosen.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
-mmax-constant-size=N
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of a
constant that can be used as an operand in a RX instruction. Although
the RX instruction set does allow constants of up to 4 bytes in length
to be used in instructions, a longer value equates to a longer
instruction. Thus in some circumstances it can be beneficial to
restrict the size of constants that are used in instructions.
Constants that are too big are instead placed into a constant pool and
referenced via register indirection. The value <em>N</em> can be between 0
and 4. A value of 0 (the default) or 4 means that constants of any
size are allowed.</dd>
<dt>
-mrelax
</dt>
<dd>Enable linker relaxation. Linker relaxation is a process
whereby the linker attempts to reduce the size of a program by finding
shorter versions of various instructions. Disabled by default.</dd>
<dt>
-mint-register=N
</dt>
<dd>Specify the number of registers to reserve for
fast interrupt handler functions. The value <em>N</em> can be between 0
and 4. A value of 1 means that register <code class="verbatim">r13</code> is reserved for the
exclusive use of fast interrupt handlers. A value of 2 reserves <code class="verbatim">r13</code>
and <code class="verbatim">r12</code>. A value of 3 reserves <code class="verbatim">r13</code>, <code class="verbatim">r12</code> and <code class="verbatim">r11</code>, and a value
of 4 reserves <code class="verbatim">r13</code> through <code class="verbatim">r10</code>. A value of 0, the default, does not
reserve any registers.</dd>
<dt>
-msave-acc-in-interrupts
</dt>
<dd>Specifies that interrupt handler functions
should preserve the accumulator register. This is only necessary if
normal code might use the accumulator register, for example because it
performs 64-bit multiplications. The default is to ignore the
accumulator as this makes the interrupt handlers faster.</dd>
<dt>
-mpid
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-mno-pid
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Enables the generation of position independent data. When enabled any
access to constant data is done via an offset from a base address held
in a register. This allows the location of constant data to be
determined at run time without requiring the executable to be relocated,
which is a benefit to embedded applications with tight memory
constraints. Data that can be modified is not affected by this option.
Note, using this feature reserves a register, usually <code class="verbatim">r13</code>, for the
constant data base address. This can result in slower and/or larger
code, especially in complicated functions. The actual register chosen to
hold the constant data base address depends upon whether the
<strong>-msmall-data-limit</strong> and/or the <strong>-mint-register</strong> command-line options
are enabled. Starting with register <code class="verbatim">r13</code> and proceeding downwards,
registers are allocated first to satisfy the requirements of
<strong>-mint-register</strong>, then <strong>-mpid</strong> and finally <strong>-msmall-data-limit</strong>. Thus it
is possible for the small data area register to be <code class="verbatim">r8</code> if both
<strong>-mint-register=4</strong> and <strong>-mpid</strong> are specified on the command line. By
default this feature is not enabled. The default can be restored via the
<strong>-mno-pid</strong> command-line option.</p>

<code class="verbatim">SMOVF</code>, <code class="verbatim">SCMPU</code>, <code class="verbatim">SMOVB</code>, <code class="verbatim">SMOVU</code>, <code class="verbatim">SUNTIL</code> <code class="verbatim">SWHILE</code> and also the
<code class="verbatim">RMPA</code> instruction. These instructions may prefetch data, which is not
safe to do if accessing an I/O register. (See section 12.2.7 of the
RX62N Group User&#39;s Manual for more information). The default is to allow
these instructions, but it is not possible for GCC to reliably detect
all circumstances where a string instruction might be used to access an
I/O register, so their use cannot be disabled automatically. Instead it
is reliant upon the programmer to use the <strong>-mno-allow-string-insns</strong>
option if their program accesses I/O space. When the instructions are
enabled GCC defines the C preprocessor symbol
<code class="verbatim">_ _RX_ALLOW_STRING_INSNS_ _</code>, otherwise it defines the symbol
<code class="verbatim">_ _RX_DISALLOW_STRING_INSNS_ _</code>.</p>

instead means that any type of branch may be used.</p>

<em>Note:</em> The generic GCC command-line option *-ffixed-*/reg/ has special
significance to the RX port when used with the <code class="verbatim">interrupt</code> function

<code class="verbatim">r12</code> and/or <code class="verbatim">r13</code> and only provided that the normal use of the
corresponding registers have been restricted via the <strong>-ffixed-*/reg/ or

<p>Store (do not store) the address of the caller&#39;s frame as backchain

pointer is stored at the bottom of the stack frame; when
<strong>-mpacked-stack</strong> is in effect, the backchain is placed into the topmost
word of the 96/160 byte register save area. In general, code compiled
with <strong>-mbackchain</strong> is call-compatible with code compiled with
<strong>-mno-backchain</strong>; however, use of the backchain for debugging purposes
usually requires that the whole binary is built with <strong>-mbackchain</strong>. Note
that the combination of <strong>-mbackchain</strong>, <strong>-mpacked-stack</strong> and

<p>Use (do not use) the packed stack layout. When <strong>-mno-packed-stack</strong> is

save area only for their default purpose; unused fields still take up
stack space. When <strong>-mpacked-stack</strong> is specified, register save slots are
densely packed at the top of the register save area; unused space is
reused for other purposes, allowing for more efficient use of the
available stack space. However, when <strong>-mbackchain</strong> is also in effect,
the topmost word of the save area is always used to store the backchain,
and the return address register is always saved two words below the
backchain. As long as the stack frame backchain is not used, code
generated with <strong>-mpacked-stack</strong> is call-compatible with code generated
with <strong>-mno-packed-stack</strong>. Note that some non-FSF releases of GCC 2.95
for S/390 or zSeries generated code that uses the stack frame backchain

<dd>Emit a warning if the current function
exceeds the given frame size. Because this is a compile-time check it
doesn&#39;t need to be a real problem when the program runs. It is
intended to identify functions that most probably cause a stack
overflow. It is useful to be used in an environment with limited stack
size e.g. the linux kernel.</dd>

<p>If these options are provided the S/390 back end emits additional
instructions in the function prologue that trigger a trap if the stack
size is <em>stack-guard</em> bytes above the <em>stack-size</em> (remember that the
stack on S/390 grows downward). If the <em>stack-guard</em> option is omitted
the smallest power of 2 larger than the frame size of the compiled
function is chosen. These options are intended to be used to help
debugging stack overflow problems. The additionally emitted code causes
only little overhead and hence can also be used in production-like
systems without greater performance degradation. The given values have
to be exact powers of 2 and <em>stack-size</em> has to be greater than
<em>stack-guard</em> without exceeding 64k. In order to be efficient the extra

atomic built-in functions see <strong>_ _atomic Builtins</strong>. The following
models and parameters are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
none

<dd>Disable compiler generated atomic sequences and emit library
calls for atomic operations. This is the default if the target is
not <code class="verbatim">sh*-*-linux*</code>.</dd>
<dt>
soft-gusa
</dt>
<dd>Generate GNU/Linux compatible gUSA software atomic
sequences for the atomic built-in functions. The generated atomic
sequences require additional support from the interrupt/exception
handling code of the system and are only suitable for SH3* and SH4*
single-core systems. This option is enabled by default when the
target is <code class="verbatim">sh*-*-linux*</code> and SH3* or SH4*. When the target is SH4A,
this option also partially utilizes the hardware atomic instructions
<code class="verbatim">movli.l</code> and <code class="verbatim">movco.l</code> to create more efficient code, unless
<strong>strict</strong> is specified.</dd>
<dt>
soft-tcb
</dt>
<dd>Generate software atomic sequences that use a variable
in the thread control block. This is a variation of the gUSA
sequences which can also be used on SH1* and SH2* targets. The
generated atomic sequences require additional support from the
interrupt/exception handling code of the system and are only
suitable for single-core systems. When using this model, the
<strong>gbr-offset=</strong> parameter has to be specified as well.</dd>
<dt>
soft-imask
</dt>
<dd>Generate software atomic sequences that temporarily
disable interrupts by setting <code class="verbatim">SR.IMASK = 1111</code>. This model works
only when the program runs in privileged mode and is only suitable
for single-core systems. Additional support from the
interrupt/exception handling code of the system is not required.
This model is enabled by default when the target is <code class="verbatim">sh*-*-linux*</code>
and SH1* or SH2*.</dd>
<dt>
hard-llcs
</dt>
<dd>Generate hardware atomic sequences using the <code class="verbatim">movli.l</code>
and <code class="verbatim">movco.l</code> instructions only. This is only available on SH4A and
is suitable for multi-core systems. Since the hardware instructions
support only 32 bit atomic variables access to 8 or 16 bit variables
is emulated with 32 bit accesses. Code compiled with this option is
also compatible with other software atomic model interrupt/exception
handling systems if executed on an SH4A system. Additional support
from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system is not
required for this model.</dd>
<dt>
gbr-offset=
</dt>
<dd>This parameter specifies the offset in bytes of the
variable in the thread control block structure that should be used
by the generated atomic sequences when the <strong>soft-tcb</strong> model has been
selected. For other models this parameter is ignored. The specified
value must be an integer multiple of four and in the range 0-1020.</dd>
<dt>
strict
</dt>
<dd>This parameter prevents mixed usage of multiple atomic
models, even if they are compatible, and makes the compiler generate
atomic sequences of the specified model only.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
-mtas
</dt>
<dd>Generate the <code class="verbatim">tas.b</code> opcode for <code class="verbatim">_ _atomic_test_and_set</code>.
Notice that depending on the particular hardware and software
configuration this can degrade overall performance due to the operand
cache line flushes that are implied by the <code class="verbatim">tas.b</code> instruction. On
multi-core SH4A processors the <code class="verbatim">tas.b</code> instruction must be used with
caution since it can result in data corruption for certain cache
configurations.</dd>

<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Don&#39;t allow (allow) the compiler generating privileged mode code.
Specifying <strong>-musermode</strong> also implies <strong>-mno-inline-ic_invalidate</strong> if the
inlined code would not work in user mode. <strong>-musermode</strong> is the default
when the target is <code class="verbatim">sh*-*-linux*</code>. If the target is SH1* or SH2*
<strong>-musermode</strong> has no effect, since there is no user mode.</p>

<dd>Set the cost to assume for a multiply insn.</dd>
<dt>
-mdiv=strategy
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the division strategy to be used for integer
division operations. <em>strategy</em> can be one of:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
call-div1
</dt>
<dd>Calls a library function that uses the single-step
division instruction <code class="verbatim">div1</code> to perform the operation. Division by
zero calculates an unspecified result and does not trap. This is the
default except for SH4, SH2A and SHcompact.</dd>
<dt>
call-fp
</dt>
<dd>Calls a library function that performs the operation in
double precision floating point. Division by zero causes a
floating-point exception. This is the default for SHcompact with
FPU. Specifying this for targets that do not have a double precision
FPU defaults to <code class="verbatim">call-div1</code>.</dd>
<dt>
call-table
</dt>
<dd>Calls a library function that uses a lookup table for
small divisors and the <code class="verbatim">div1</code> instruction with case distinction for
larger divisors. Division by zero calculates an unspecified result
and does not trap. This is the default for SH4. Specifying this for
targets that do not have dynamic shift instructions defaults to
<code class="verbatim">call-div1</code>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When a division strategy has not been specified the default strategy
is selected based on the current target. For SH2A the default strategy
is to use the <code class="verbatim">divs</code> and <code class="verbatim">divu</code> instructions instead of library
function calls.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
-maccumulate-outgoing-args
</dt>
<dd>Reserve space once for outgoing
arguments in the function prologue rather than around each call.
Generally beneficial for performance and size. Also needed for
unwinding to avoid changing the stack frame around conditional code.</dd>
<dt>
-mdivsi3_libfunc=name
</dt>
<dd>Set the name of the library function used for
32-bit signed division to <em>name</em>. This only affects the name used in
the <strong>call</strong> division strategies, and the compiler still expects the
same sets of input/output/clobbered registers as if this option were
not present.</dd>
<dt>
-mfixed-range=register-range
</dt>
<dd>Generate code treating the given
register range as fixed registers. A fixed register is one that the
register allocator cannot use. This is useful when compiling kernel
code. A register range is specified as two registers separated by a
dash. Multiple register ranges can be specified separated by a comma.</dd>
<dt>
-mbranch-cost=num
</dt>
<dd>Assume <em>num</em> to be the cost for a branch
instruction. Higher numbers make the compiler try to generate more
branch-free code if possible. If not specified the value is selected

<p>Assume (do not assume) that zero displacement conditional branch
instructions <code class="verbatim">bt</code> and <code class="verbatim">bf</code> are fast. If <strong>-mzdcbranch</strong> is specified, the

enabled by default when generating code for SH4 and SH4A. It can be
explicitly disabled by specifying <strong>-mno-zdcbranch</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mcbranch-force-delay-slot

in combination with <strong>-funsafe-math-optimizations</strong> and
<strong>-ffinite-math-only</strong>. It is enabled by default when generating code for

<p><em>Solaris 2 Options</em></p>
<p>
These <strong>-m</strong> options are supported on Solaris 2:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mclear-hwcap
</dt>
<dd><strong>-mclear-hwcap</strong> tells the compiler to remove the
hardware capabilities generated by the Solaris assembler. This is only
necessary when object files use ISA extensions not supported by the
current machine, but check at runtime whether or not to use them.</dd>
<dt>
-mimpure-text
</dt>
<dd><strong>-mimpure-text</strong>, used in addition to <strong>-shared</strong>, tells
the compiler to not pass <strong>-z text</strong> to the linker when linking a shared
object. Using this option, you can link position-dependent code into a
shared object. <strong>-mimpure-text</strong> suppresses the &#34;relocations remain
against allocatable but non-writable sections&#34; linker error message.
However, the necessary relocations trigger copy-on-write, and the
shared object is not actually shared across processes. Instead of
using <strong>-mimpure-text</strong>, you should compile all source code with <strong>-fpic</strong>
or <strong>-fPIC</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These switches are supported in addition to the above on Solaris 2:</p>

<dl>
<dt>
-mno-app-regs

-mapp-regs
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Specify <strong>-mapp-regs</strong> to generate output using the global registers 2
through 4, which the SPARC SVR4 ABI reserves for applications. Like the
global register 1, each global register 2 through 4 is then treated as
an allocable register that is clobbered by function calls. This is the
default. To be fully SVR4 ABI-compliant at the cost of some performance
loss, specify <strong>-mno-app-regs</strong>. You should compile libraries and system
software with this option.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mflat
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-mno-flat
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>With <strong>-mflat</strong>, the compiler does not generate save/restore instructions
and uses a &#34;flat&#34; or single register window model. This model is
compatible with the regular register window model. The local registers
and the input registers (0–5) are still treated as &#34;call-saved&#34;
registers and are saved on the stack as needed. With <strong>-mno-flat</strong> (the
default), the compiler generates save/restore instructions (except for
leaf functions). This is the normal operating mode.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mfpu
</dt>
<dd></dd>

<dl>

-mno-fpu
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-msoft-float
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Generate output containing library calls for floating point. <strong>Warning:</strong>
the requisite libraries are not available for all SPARC targets.
Normally the facilities of the machine&#39;s usual C compiler are used, but
this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation. You must make your
own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation. The embedded targets <strong>sparc-</strong>-aout* and
<strong>sparclite-</strong>-<strong>* do provide software floating-point support.
*-msoft-float</strong> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile <em>all</em> of a program with this
option. In particular, you need to compile <em>libgcc.a</em>, the library that
comes with GCC, with <strong>-msoft-float</strong> in order for this to work.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mhard-quad-float
</dt>
<dd>Generate output containing quad-word (long
double) floating-point instructions.</dd>
<dt>
-msoft-quad-float
</dt>
<dd>Generate output containing library calls for
quad-word (long double) floating-point instructions. The functions
called are those specified in the SPARC ABI. This is the default. As
of this writing, there are no SPARC implementations that have hardware
support for the quad-word floating-point instructions. They all invoke
a trap handler for one of these instructions, and then the trap
handler emulates the effect of the instruction. Because of the trap
handler overhead, this is much slower than calling the ABI library
routines. Thus the <strong>-msoft-quad-float</strong> option is the default.</dd>
<dt>
-mno-unaligned-doubles
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-munaligned-doubles
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Assume that doubles have 8-byte alignment. This is the default. With
<strong>-munaligned-doubles</strong>, GCC assumes that doubles have 8-byte alignment
only if they are contained in another type, or if they have an absolute
address. Otherwise, it assumes they have 4-byte alignment. Specifying
this option avoids some rare compatibility problems with code generated
by other compilers. It is not the default because it results in a
performance loss, especially for floating-point code.</p>

-mfaster-structs
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-mno-faster-structs
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>With <strong>-mfaster-structs</strong>, the compiler assumes that structures should

<p>By default (unless configured otherwise), GCC generates code for the
V7 variant of the SPARC architecture. With <strong>-mcpu=cypress</strong>, the
compiler additionally optimizes it for the Cypress CY7C602 chip, as
used in the SPARCStation/SPARCServer 3xx series. This is also
appropriate for the older SPARCStation 1, 2, IPX etc. With <strong>-mcpu=v8</strong>,
GCC generates code for the V8 variant of the SPARC architecture. The
only difference from V7 code is that the compiler emits the integer
multiply and integer divide instructions which exist in SPARC-V8 but
not in SPARC-V7. With <strong>-mcpu=supersparc</strong>, the compiler additionally
optimizes it for the SuperSPARC chip, as used in the SPARCStation 10,
1000 and 2000 series. With <strong>-mcpu=sparclite</strong>, GCC generates code for
the SPARClite variant of the SPARC architecture. This adds the integer
multiply, integer divide step and scan (<code class="verbatim">ffs</code>) instructions which
exist in SPARClite but not in SPARC-V7. With <strong>-mcpu=f930</strong>, the
compiler additionally optimizes it for the Fujitsu MB86930 chip, which
is the original SPARClite, with no FPU. With <strong>-mcpu=f934</strong>, the
compiler additionally optimizes it for the Fujitsu MB86934 chip, which
is the more recent SPARClite with FPU. With <strong>-mcpu=sparclet</strong>, GCC
generates code for the SPARClet variant of the SPARC architecture.
This adds the integer multiply, multiply/accumulate, integer divide
step and scan (<code class="verbatim">ffs</code>) instructions which exist in SPARClet but not in
SPARC-V7. With <strong>-mcpu=tsc701</strong>, the compiler additionally optimizes it
for the TEMIC SPARClet chip. With <strong>-mcpu=v9</strong>, GCC generates code for
the V9 variant of the SPARC architecture. This adds 64-bit integer and
floating-point move instructions, 3 additional floating-point
condition code registers and conditional move instructions. With
<strong>-mcpu=ultrasparc</strong>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for the Sun
UltraSPARC I/II/IIi chips. With <strong>-mcpu=ultrasparc3</strong>, the compiler
additionally optimizes it for the Sun UltraSPARC
III/III+/IIIi/IIIi+/IV/IV+ chips. With <strong>-mcpu=niagara</strong>, the compiler
additionally optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T1 chips. With
<strong>-mcpu=niagara2</strong>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for Sun
UltraSPARC T2 chips. With <strong>-mcpu=niagara3</strong>, the compiler additionally
optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T3 chips. With <strong>-mcpu=niagara4</strong>, the
compiler additionally optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T4 chips. With
<strong>-mcpu=niagara7</strong>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for Oracle
SPARC M7 chips. With <strong>-mcpu=m8</strong>, the compiler additionally optimizes
it for Oracle M8 chips.</p>

<em>Visium Options</em></p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mdebug
</dt>
<dd>A program which performs file I/O and is destined to run on
an MCM target should be linked with this option. It causes the
libraries libc.a and libdebug.a to be linked. The program should be
run on the target under the control of the GDB remote debugging stub.</dd>
<dt>
-msim
</dt>
<dd>A program which performs file I/O and is destined to run on
the simulator should be linked with option. This causes libraries
libc.a and libsim.a to be linked.</dd>
<dt>
-mfpu
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-mhard-float
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Generate code containing floating-point instructions. This is the
default.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mno-fpu
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-msoft-float
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Generate code containing library calls for floating-point.
<strong>-msoft-float</strong> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile <em>all</em> of a program with this
option. In particular, you need to compile <em>libgcc.a</em>, the library that
comes with GCC, with <strong>-msoft-float</strong> in order for this to work.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mcpu=cpu_type
</dt>
<dd>Set the instruction set, register set, and
instruction scheduling parameters for machine type <em>cpu_type</em>.
Supported values for <em>cpu_type</em> are <strong>mcm</strong>, <strong>gr5</strong> and <strong>gr6</strong>. <strong>mcm</strong> is a
synonym of <strong>gr5</strong> present for backward compatibility. By default
(unless configured otherwise), GCC generates code for the GR5 variant
of the Visium architecture. With <strong>-mcpu=gr6</strong>, GCC generates code for
the GR6 variant of the Visium architecture. The only difference from
GR5 code is that the compiler will generate block move instructions.</dd>
<dt>
-mtune=cpu_type
</dt>
<dd>Set the instruction scheduling parameters for
machine type <em>cpu_type</em>, but do not set the instruction set or
register set that the option *-mcpu=*/cpu_type/ would.</dd>
<dt>
-msv-mode
</dt>
<dd>Generate code for the supervisor mode, where there are no
restrictions on the access to general registers. This is the default.</dd>
<dt>
-muser-mode
</dt>
<dd>Generate code for the user mode, where the access to
some general registers is forbidden: on the GR5, registers r24 to r31
cannot be accessed in this mode; on the GR6, only registers r29 to r31
are affected.</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>VMS Options</em></p>
<p>
These <strong>-m</strong> options are defined for the VMS implementations:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mvms-return-codes
</dt>
<dd>Return VMS condition codes from <code class="verbatim">main</code>. The
default is to return POSIX-style condition (e.g. error) codes.</dd>
<dt>
-mdebug-main=prefix
</dt>
<dd>Flag the first routine whose name starts with
<em>prefix</em> as the main routine for the debugger.</dd>
<dt>
-mmalloc64
</dt>
<dd>Default to 64-bit memory allocation routines.</dd>
<dt>
-mpointer-size=size
</dt>
<dd>Set the default size of pointers. Possible
options for <em>size</em> are <strong>32</strong> or <strong>short</strong> for 32 bit pointers, <strong>64</strong> or
<strong>long</strong> for 64 bit pointers, and <strong>no</strong> for supporting only 32 bit
pointers. The later option disables <code class="verbatim">pragma pointer_size</code>.</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>VxWorks Options</em></p>
<p>
The options in this section are defined for all VxWorks targets. Options
specific to the target hardware are listed with the other options for
that target.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mrtp
</dt>
<dd>GCC can generate code for both VxWorks kernels and real time
processes (RTPs). This option switches from the former to the latter.
It also defines the preprocessor macro <code class="verbatim">_ _RTP_ _</code>.</dd>
<dt>
-non-static
</dt>
<dd>Link an RTP executable against shared libraries rather
than static libraries. The options <strong>-static</strong> and <strong>-shared</strong> can also be
used for RTPs; <strong>-static</strong> is the default.</dd>
<dt>
-Bstatic
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-Bdynamic
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>These options are passed down to the linker. They are defined for
compatibility with Diab.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-Xbind-lazy
</dt>
<dd>Enable lazy binding of function calls. This option is
equivalent to <strong>-Wl,-z,now</strong> and is defined for compatibility with Diab.</dd>
<dt>
-Xbind-now
</dt>
<dd>Disable lazy binding of function calls. This option is
the default and is defined for compatibility with Diab.</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>x86 Options</em></p>
<p>
These <strong>-m</strong> options are defined for the x86 family of computers.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-march=cpu-type
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Generate instructions for the machine type
<em>cpu-type</em>. In contrast to *-mtune=*/cpu-type/, which merely tunes the
generated code for the specified <em>cpu-type</em>, *-march=*/cpu-type/
allows GCC to generate code that may not run at all on processors
other than the one indicated. Specifying *-march=*/cpu-type/ implies
*-mtune=*/cpu-type/, except where noted otherwise. The choices for
<em>cpu-type</em> are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
native
</dt>
<dd>This selects the CPU to generate code for at compilation
time by determining the processor type of the compiling machine.
Using <strong>-march=native</strong> enables all instruction subsets supported by
the local machine (hence the result might not run on different
machines). Using <strong>-mtune=native</strong> produces code optimized for the
local machine under the constraints of the selected instruction set.</dd>
<dt>
x86-64
</dt>
<dd>A generic CPU with 64-bit extensions.</dd>

<dd></dd>
<dt>
x86-64-v3
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
x86-64-v4
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>These choices for <em>cpu-type</em> select the corresponding
micro-architecture level from the x86-64 psABI. On ABIs other than the
x86-64 psABI they select the same CPU features as the x86-64 psABI
documents for the particular micro-architecture level. Since these
<em>cpu-type</em> values do not have a corresponding <strong>-mtune</strong> setting, using
<strong>-march</strong> with these values enables generic tuning. Specific tuning can
be enabled using the *-mtune=*/other-cpu-type/ option with an
appropriate <em>other-cpu-type</em> value.</p>

computed in 80-bit precision instead of the precision specified
by the type, resulting in slightly different results compared to

Athlon MP chips. The earlier version of the SSE instruction set
supports only single-precision arithmetic, thus the double and
extended-precision arithmetic are still done using 387. A later
version, present only in Pentium 4 and AMD x86-64 chips, supports
double-precision arithmetic too. For the x86-32 compiler, you must
use <strong>-march=*/cpu-type/, *-msse</strong> or <strong>-msse2</strong> switches to enable SSE
extensions and make this option effective. For the x86-64 compiler,
these extensions are enabled by default. The resulting code should
be considerably faster in the majority of cases and avoid the
numerical instability problems of 387 code, but may break some
existing code that expects temporaries to be 80 bits. This is the
default choice for the x86-64 compiler, Darwin x86-32 targets, and

<code class="verbatim">double</code> variables on a two-word boundary produces code that runs
somewhat faster on a Pentium at the expense of more memory. On x86-64,
<strong>-malign-double</strong> is enabled by default. <strong>Warning:</strong> if you use the
<strong>-malign-double</strong> switch, structures containing the above types are
aligned differently than the published application binary interface
specifications for the x86-32 and are not binary compatible with
structures in code compiled without that switch.</p>

-m96bit-long-double
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-m128bit-long-double
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>These switches control the size of <code class="verbatim">long double</code> type. The x86-32
application binary interface specifies the size to be 96 bits, so
<strong>-m96bit-long-double</strong> is the default in 32-bit mode. Modern
architectures (Pentium and newer) prefer <code class="verbatim">long double</code> to be aligned to
an 8- or 16-byte boundary. In arrays or structures conforming to the
ABI, this is not possible. So specifying <strong>-m128bit-long-double</strong> aligns
<code class="verbatim">long double</code> to a 16-byte boundary by padding the <code class="verbatim">long double</code> with an
additional 32-bit zero. In the x86-64 compiler, <strong>-m128bit-long-double</strong>
is the default choice as its ABI specifies that <code class="verbatim">long double</code> is aligned
on 16-byte boundary. Notice that neither of these options enable any
extra precision over the x87 standard of 80 bits for a <code class="verbatim">long double</code>.
<strong>Warning:</strong> if you override the default value for your target ABI, this
changes the size of structures and arrays containing <code class="verbatim">long double</code>
variables, as well as modifying the function calling convention for
functions taking <code class="verbatim">long double</code>. Hence they are not binary-compatible
with code compiled without that switch.</p>

default for 64-bit Bionic C library. <strong>Warning:</strong> if you override the
default value for your target ABI, this changes the size of structures

<dt>
-mrtd
</dt>
<dd>Use a different function-calling convention, in which
functions that take a fixed number of arguments return with the
=ret =/=num=/ instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.
This saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop
the arguments there. You can specify that an individual function is
called with this calling sequence with the function attribute
<code class="verbatim">stdcall</code>. You can also override the <strong>-mrtd</strong> option by using the
function attribute <code class="verbatim">cdecl</code>. <strong>Warning:</strong> this calling convention is
incompatible with the one normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it
if you need to call libraries compiled with the Unix compiler. Also,
you must provide function prototypes for all functions that take
variable numbers of arguments (including <code class="verbatim">printf</code>); otherwise
incorrect code is generated for calls to those functions. In addition,
seriously incorrect code results if you call a function with too many
arguments. (Normally, extra arguments are harmlessly ignored.)</dd>

<strong>Warning:</strong> if you use this switch, and <em>num</em> is nonzero, then you must
build all modules with the same value, including any libraries. This
includes the system libraries and startup modules.</dd>

<p>Set 80387 floating-point precision to 32, 64 or 80 bits. When <strong>-mpc32</strong>
is specified, the significands of results of floating-point operations
are rounded to 24 bits (single precision); <strong>-mpc64</strong> rounds the
significands of results of floating-point operations to 53 bits (double
precision) and <strong>-mpc80</strong> rounds the significands of results of
floating-point operations to 64 bits (extended double precision), which
is the default. When this option is used, floating-point operations in
higher precisions are not available to the programmer without setting
the FPU control word explicitly. Setting the rounding of floating-point
operations to less than the default 80 bits can speed some programs by
2% or more. Note that some mathematical libraries assume that
extended-precision (80-bit) floating-point operations are enabled by
default; routines in such libraries could suffer significant loss of
accuracy, typically through so-called &#34;catastrophic cancellation&#34;, when
this option is used to set the precision to less than extended

with <strong>-shared</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-mstackrealign
</dt>
<dd>Realign the stack at entry. On the x86, the
<strong>-mstackrealign</strong> option generates an alternate prologue and epilogue
that realigns the run-time stack if necessary. This supports mixing
legacy codes that keep 4-byte stack alignment with modern codes that
keep 16-byte stack alignment for SSE compatibility. See also the
attribute <code class="verbatim">force_align_arg_pointer</code>, applicable to individual
functions.</dd>
<dt>
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=num
</dt>
<dd>Attempt to keep the stack boundary
aligned to a 2 raised to <em>num</em> byte boundary. If
<strong>-mpreferred-stack-boundary</strong> is not specified, the default is 4 (16
bytes or 128 bits). <strong>Warning:</strong> When generating code for the x86-64
architecture with SSE extensions disabled,
<strong>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3</strong> can be used to keep the stack boundary
aligned to 8 byte boundary. Since x86-64 ABI require 16 byte stack
alignment, this is ABI incompatible and intended to be used in
controlled environment where stack space is important limitation. This
option leads to wrong code when functions compiled with 16 byte stack
alignment (such as functions from a standard library) are called with
misaligned stack. In this case, SSE instructions may lead to
misaligned memory access traps. In addition, variable arguments are
handled incorrectly for 16 byte aligned objects (including x87 long
double and _ _int128), leading to wrong results. You must build all
modules with <strong>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3</strong>, including any libraries.
This includes the system libraries and startup modules.</dd>
<dt>
-mincoming-stack-boundary=num
</dt>
<dd>Assume the incoming stack is aligned
to a 2 raised to <em>num</em> byte boundary. If <strong>-mincoming-stack-boundary</strong>
is not specified, the one specified by <strong>-mpreferred-stack-boundary</strong> is
used. On Pentium and Pentium Pro, <code class="verbatim">double</code> and <code class="verbatim">long double</code> values
should be aligned to an 8-byte boundary (see <strong>-malign-double</strong>) or
suffer significant run time performance penalties. On Pentium III, the
Streaming SIMD Extension (SSE) data type <code class="verbatim">_ _m128</code> may not work
properly if it is not 16-byte aligned. To ensure proper alignment of
this values on the stack, the stack boundary must be as aligned as
that required by any value stored on the stack. Further, every
function must be generated such that it keeps the stack aligned. Thus
calling a function compiled with a higher preferred stack boundary
from a function compiled with a lower preferred stack boundary most
likely misaligns the stack. It is recommended that libraries that use
callbacks always use the default setting. This extra alignment does
consume extra stack space, and generally increases code size. Code
that is sensitive to stack space usage, such as embedded systems and
operating system kernels, may want to reduce the preferred alignment
to <strong>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2</strong>.</dd>

Each has a corresponding <strong>-mno-</strong> option to disable use of these
instructions. These extensions are also available as built-in functions:
see <strong>x86 Built-in Functions</strong>, for details of the functions enabled and
disabled by these switches. To generate SSE/SSE2 instructions
automatically from floating-point code (as opposed to 387 instructions),
see <strong>-mfpmath=sse</strong>. GCC depresses SSEx instructions when <strong>-mavx</strong> is
used. Instead, it generates new AVX instructions or AVX equivalence for
all SSEx instructions when needed. These options enable GCC to use these
extended instructions in generated code, even without <strong>-mfpmath=sse</strong>.
Applications that perform run-time CPU detection must compile separate
files for each supported architecture, using the appropriate flags. In
particular, the file containing the CPU detection code should be
compiled without these options.</p>

<dt>
-mcld
</dt>
<dd>This option instructs GCC to emit a <code class="verbatim">cld</code> instruction in the
prologue of functions that use string instructions. String
instructions depend on the DF flag to select between autoincrement or
autodecrement mode. While the ABI specifies the DF flag to be cleared
on function entry, some operating systems violate this specification
by not clearing the DF flag in their exception dispatchers. The
exception handler can be invoked with the DF flag set, which leads to
wrong direction mode when string instructions are used. This option
can be enabled by default on 32-bit x86 targets by configuring GCC
with the <strong>–enable-cld</strong> configure option. Generation of <code class="verbatim">cld</code>
instructions can be suppressed with the <strong>-mno-cld</strong> compiler option in
this case.</dd>

operations on 16-byte aligned 128-bit objects. This is useful for
atomic updates of data structures exceeding one machine word in size.

<code class="verbatim">LAHF</code> and <code class="verbatim">SAHF</code> instructions which are supported by AMD64. These are
load and store instructions, respectively, for certain status flags.
In 64-bit mode, the <code class="verbatim">SAHF</code> instruction is used to optimize <code class="verbatim">fmod</code>,

-mrecip
</dt>
<dd>This option enables use of <code class="verbatim">RCPSS</code> and <code class="verbatim">RSQRTSS</code>
instructions (and their vectorized variants <code class="verbatim">RCPPS</code> and <code class="verbatim">RSQRTPS</code>)
with an additional Newton-Raphson step to increase precision instead
of <code class="verbatim">DIVSS</code> and <code class="verbatim">SQRTSS</code> (and their vectorized variants) for
single-precision floating-point arguments. These instructions are
generated only when <strong>-funsafe-math-optimizations</strong> is enabled together
with <strong>-ffinite-math-only</strong> and <strong>-fno-trapping-math</strong>. Note that while
the throughput of the sequence is higher than the throughput of the
non-reciprocal instruction, the precision of the sequence can be
decreased by up to 2 ulp (i.e. the inverse of 1.0 equals 0.99999994).
Note that GCC implements <code class="verbatim">1.0f/sqrtf(=/=x=/</code>)= in terms of <code class="verbatim">RSQRTSS</code>
(or <code class="verbatim">RSQRTPS</code>) already with <strong>-ffast-math</strong> (or the above option

<dd>Generate code for the specified calling convention.
Permissible values are <strong>sysv</strong> for the ABI used on GNU/Linux and other

<dt>
-mcet-switch
</dt>
<dd>By default, CET instrumentation is turned off on
switch statements that use a jump table and indirect branch track is
disabled. Since jump tables are stored in read-only memory, this does
not result in a direct loss of hardening. But if the jump table index
is attacker-controlled, the indirect jump may not be constrained by
CET. This option turns on CET instrumentation to enable indirect
branch track for switch statements with jump tables which leads to the
jump targets reachable via any indirect jumps.</dd>
<dt>
-mcall-ms2sysv-xlogues
</dt>
<dd>Due to differences in 64-bit ABIs, any
Microsoft ABI function that calls a System V ABI function must
consider RSI, RDI and XMM6-15 as clobbered. By default, the code for
saving and restoring these registers is emitted inline, resulting in
fairly lengthy prologues and epilogues. Using <strong>-mcall-ms2sysv-xlogues</strong>
emits prologues and epilogues that use stubs in the static portion of
libgcc to perform these saves and restores, thus reducing function
size at the cost of a few extra instructions.</dd>
<dt>
-mtls-dialect=type
</dt>
<dd>Generate code to access thread-local storage
using the <strong>gnu</strong> or <strong>gnu2</strong> conventions. <strong>gnu</strong> is the conservative

<dl>
<dt>
-maccumulate-outgoing-args
</dt>
<dd>If enabled, the maximum amount of space
required for outgoing arguments is computed in the function prologue.
This is faster on most modern CPUs because of reduced dependencies,
improved scheduling and reduced stack usage when the preferred stack
boundary is not equal to 2. The drawback is a notable increase in code
size. This switch implies <strong>-mno-push-args</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
-mthreads
</dt>
<dd>Support thread-safe exception handling on MinGW. Programs
that rely on thread-safe exception handling must compile and link all
code with the <strong>-mthreads</strong> option. When compiling, <strong>-mthreads</strong> defines

<p>Enable/disable bit-field layout compatible with the native Microsoft
Windows compiler. If <code class="verbatim">packed</code> is used on a structure, or if bit-fields
are used, it may be that the Microsoft ABI lays out the structure
differently than the way GCC normally does. Particularly when moving
packed data between functions compiled with GCC and the native Microsoft
compiler (either via function call or as data in a file), it may be
necessary to access either format. This option is enabled by default for
Microsoft Windows targets. This behavior can also be controlled locally
by use of variable or type attributes. For more information, see <strong>x86
Variable Attributes</strong> and <strong>x86 Type Attributes</strong>. The Microsoft structure
layout algorithm is fairly simple with the exception of the bit-field
packing. The padding and alignment of members of structures and whether
a bit-field can straddle a storage-unit boundary are determine by these
rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>declared: the first member has the lowest memory address and the last
member the highest.</li>
<li>for all data except structures, unions, and arrays is either the size
of the object or the current packing size (specified with either the
<code class="verbatim">aligned</code> attribute or the <code class="verbatim">pack</code> pragma), whichever is less. For
structures, unions, and arrays, the alignment requirement is the
largest alignment requirement of its members. Every object is
allocated an offset so that: offset % alignment_requirement == 0</li>
<li>unit if the integral types are the same size and if the next
bit-field fits into the current allocation unit without crossing the
boundary imposed by the common alignment requirements of the
bit-fields.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>MSVC interprets zero-length bit-fields in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>are normally coalesced, the bit-fields are not coalesced. For
example: struct { unsigned long bf_1 : 12; unsigned long : 0;
unsigned long bf_2 : 12; } t1; The size of <code class="verbatim">t1</code> is 8 bytes with the
zero-length bit-field. If the zero-length bit-field were removed,
<code class="verbatim">t1</code>&#39;s size would be 4 bytes.</li>
<li>
<p>alignment of the zero-length bit-field is greater than the member
that follows it, <code class="verbatim">bar</code>, <code class="verbatim">bar</code> is aligned as the type of the
zero-length bit-field. For example: struct { char foo : 4; short : 0;
char bar; } t2; struct { char foo : 4; short : 0; double bar; } t3;
For <code class="verbatim">t2</code>, <code class="verbatim">bar</code> is placed at offset 2, rather than offset 1.
Accordingly, the size of <code class="verbatim">t2</code> is 4. For <code class="verbatim">t3</code>, the zero-length
bit-field does not affect the alignment of <code class="verbatim">bar</code> or, as a result, the
size of the structure. Taking this into account, it is important to
note the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>zero-length bit-field may affect the alignment of the structure as
whole. For example, <code class="verbatim">t2</code> has a size of 4 bytes, since the
zero-length bit-field follows a normal bit-field, and is of type
short.</li>
<li>still affect the alignment of the structure: struct { char foo :
6; long : 0; } t4; Here, <code class="verbatim">t4</code> takes up 4 bytes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>struct { char foo; long : 0; char bar; } t5; Here, <code class="verbatim">t5</code> takes up 2
bytes.</li>
</ol>

automatically align instructions to reduce branch penalties at the
expense of some code density. The assembler attempts to widen density
instructions to align branch targets and the instructions following call
instructions. If there are not enough preceding safe density
instructions to align a target, no widening is performed. The default is
<strong>-mtarget-align</strong>. These options do not affect the treatment of
auto-aligned instructions like <code class="verbatim">LOOP</code>, which the assembler always
aligns, either by widening density instructions or by inserting NOP
instructions.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mlongcalls
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
-mno-longcalls
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to translate
direct calls to indirect calls unless it can determine that the target
of a direct call is in the range allowed by the call instruction. This
translation typically occurs for calls to functions in other source
files. Specifically, the assembler translates a direct <code class="verbatim">CALL</code>
instruction into an <code class="verbatim">L32R</code> followed by a <code class="verbatim">CALLX</code> instruction. The
default is <strong>-mno-longcalls</strong>. This option should be used in programs
where the call target can potentially be out of range. This option is
implemented in the assembler, not the compiler, so the assembly code
generated by GCC still shows direct call instructions—look at the
disassembled object code to see the actual instructions. Note that the
assembler uses an indirect call for every cross-file call, not just
those that really are out of range.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
-mabi=name
</dt>
<dd>Generate code for the specified ABI. Permissible values
are: <strong>call0</strong>, <strong>windowed</strong>. Default ABI is chosen by the Xtensa core
configuration.</dd>
<dt>
-mabi=call0
</dt>
<dd>When this option is enabled function parameters are
passed in registers <code class="verbatim">a2</code> through <code class="verbatim">a7</code>, registers <code class="verbatim">a12</code> through <code class="verbatim">a15</code>
are caller-saved, and register <code class="verbatim">a15</code> may be used as a frame pointer.
When this version of the ABI is enabled the C preprocessor symbol
<code class="verbatim">_ _XTENSA_CALL0_ABI_ _</code> is defined.</dd>
<dt>
-mabi=windowed
</dt>
<dd>When this option is enabled function parameters are
passed in registers <code class="verbatim">a10</code> through <code class="verbatim">a15</code>, and called function rotates
register window by 8 registers on entry so that its arguments are
found in registers <code class="verbatim">a2</code> through <code class="verbatim">a7</code>. Register <code class="verbatim">a7</code> may be used as a
frame pointer. Register window is rotated 8 registers back upon
return. When this version of the ABI is enabled the C preprocessor
symbol <code class="verbatim">_ _XTENSA_WINDOWED_ABI_ _</code> is defined.</dd>
<dt>
-mextra-l32r-costs=n
</dt>
<dd>Specify an extra cost of instruction RAM/ROM
access for <code class="verbatim">L32R</code> instructions, in clock cycles. This affects, when
optimizing for speed, whether loading a constant from literal pool
using <code class="verbatim">L32R</code> or synthesizing the constant from a small one with a
couple of arithmetic instructions. The default value is 0.</dd>

ENVIRONMENT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-24" class="outline-text-2">
<p>This section describes several environment variables that affect how GCC
operates. Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files. Some are used to specify
other aspects of the compilation environment.</p>
<p>
Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
<strong>-B</strong>, <strong>-I</strong> and <strong>-L</strong>. These take precedence over places specified using
environment variables, which in turn take precedence over those
specified by the configuration of GCC.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
LANG
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
LC_CTYPE
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
LC_MESSAGES
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
LC_ALL
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>These environment variables control the way that GCC uses localization
information which allows GCC to work with different national
conventions. GCC inspects the locale categories <strong>LC_CTYPE</strong> and
<strong>LC_MESSAGES</strong> if it has been configured to do so. These locale
categories can be set to any value supported by your installation. A
typical value is <strong>en_GB.UTF-8</strong> for English in the United Kingdom encoded
in UTF-8. The <strong>LC_CTYPE</strong> environment variable specifies character
classification. GCC uses it to determine the character boundaries in a
string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that are otherwise interpreted as a string end or
escape. The <strong>LC_MESSAGES</strong> environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages. If the <strong>LC_ALL</strong> environment variable is set,
it overrides the value of <strong>LC_CTYPE</strong> and <strong>LC_MESSAGES</strong>; otherwise,
<strong>LC_CTYPE</strong> and <strong>LC_MESSAGES</strong> default to the value of the <strong>LANG</strong>
environment variable. If none of these variables are set, GCC defaults
to traditional C English behavior.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
TMPDIR
</dt>
<dd>If <strong>TMPDIR</strong> is set, it specifies the directory to use for
temporary files. GCC uses temporary files to hold the output of one
stage of compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage:
for example, the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the
compiler proper.</dd>
<dt>
GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG
</dt>
<dd>Setting <strong>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</strong> is nearly equivalent
to passing <strong>-fcompare-debug</strong> to the compiler driver. See the
documentation of this option for more details.</dd>
<dt>
GCC_EXEC_PREFIX
</dt>
<dd>If <strong>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</strong> is set, it specifies a prefix
to use in the names of the subprograms executed by the compiler. No
slash is added when this prefix is combined with the name of a
subprogram, but you can specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you
wish. If <strong>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</strong> is not set, GCC attempts to figure out an
appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it is invoked with. If
GCC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it tries
looking in the usual places for the subprogram. The default value of
<strong>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</strong> is <em>prefix/lib/gcc/</em> where <em>prefix</em> is the prefix to
the installed compiler. In many cases <em>prefix</em> is the value of
<code class="verbatim">prefix</code> when you ran the <em>configure</em> script. Other prefixes specified
with <strong>-B</strong> take precedence over this prefix. This prefix is also used
for finding files such as <em>crt0.o</em> that are used for linking. In
addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files. For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with <strong>/usr/local/lib/gcc</strong> (more
precisely, with the value of <strong>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</strong>), GCC tries replacing
that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an alternate
directory name. Thus, with <strong>-Bfoo/</strong>, GCC searches <em>foo/bar</em> just
before it searches the standard directory <em>/usr/local/lib/bar</em>. If a
standard directory begins with the configured <em>prefix</em> then the value
of <em>prefix</em> is replaced by <strong>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</strong> when looking for header
files.</dd>
<dt>
COMPILER_PATH
</dt>
<dd>The value of <strong>COMPILER_PATH</strong> is a colon-separated
list of directories, much like <strong>PATH</strong>. GCC tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it cannot find the
subprograms using <strong>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
LIBRARY_PATH
</dt>
<dd>The value of <strong>LIBRARY_PATH</strong> is a colon-separated list
of directories, much like <strong>PATH</strong>. When configured as a native
compiler, GCC tries the directories thus specified when searching for
special linker files, if it cannot find them using <strong>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</strong>.
Linking using GCC also uses these directories when searching for
ordinary libraries for the <strong>-l</strong> option (but directories specified with
<strong>-L</strong> come first).</dd>
<dt>
LANG
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This variable is used to pass locale information to the
compiler. One way in which this information is used is to determine
the character set to be used when character literals, string literals
and comments are parsed in C and C++. When the compiler is configured
to allow multibyte characters, the following values for <strong>LANG</strong> are
recognized:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
C-JIS
</dt>
<dd>Recognize JIS characters.</dd>
<dt>
C-SJIS
</dt>
<dd>Recognize SJIS characters.</dd>
<dt>
C-EUCJP
</dt>
<dd>Recognize EUCJP characters.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If <strong>LANG</strong> is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler uses <code class="verbatim">mblen</code> and <code class="verbatim">mbtowc</code> as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
GCC_EXTRA_DIAGNOSTIC_OUTPUT
</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <strong>GCC_EXTRA_DIAGNOSTIC_OUTPUT</strong> is set
to one of the following values, then additional text will be emitted
to stderr when fix-it hints are emitted.
<strong>-fdiagnostics-parseable-fixits</strong> and
<strong>-fno-diagnostics-parseable-fixits</strong> take precedence over this
environment variable.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
fixits-v1
</dt>
<dd>Emit parseable fix-it hints, equivalent to
<strong>-fdiagnostics-parseable-fixits</strong>. In particular, columns are
expressed as a count of bytes, starting at byte 1 for the initial
column.</dd>
<dt>
fixits-v2
</dt>
<dd>As <code class="verbatim">fixits-v1</code>, but columns are expressed as display
columns, as per <strong>-fdiagnostics-column-unit=display</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Some additional environment variables affect the behavior of the
preprocessor.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
CPATH
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
C_INCLUDE_PATH
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>
OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH
</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>Each variable&#39;s value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like <strong>PATH</strong>, in which to look for header files. The
special character, <code class="verbatim">PATH_SEPARATOR</code>, is target-dependent and determined
at GCC build time. For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon. <strong>CPATH</strong>
specifies a list of directories to be searched as if specified with
<strong>-I</strong>, but after any paths given with <strong>-I</strong> options on the command line.
This environment variable is used regardless of which language is being
preprocessed. The remaining environment variables apply only when
preprocessing the particular language indicated. Each specifies a list
of directories to be searched as if specified with <strong>-isystem</strong>, but after
any paths given with <strong>-isystem</strong> options on the command line. In all
these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to search its
current working directory. Empty elements can appear at the beginning or
end of a path. For instance, if the value of <strong>CPATH</strong> is
<code class="verbatim">:/special/include</code>, that has the same effect as <strong>-I.
-I/special/include</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT
</dt>
<dd>If this variable is set, its value specifies
how to output dependencies for Make based on the non-system header
files processed by the compiler. System header files are ignored in
the dependency output. The value of <strong>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</strong> can be just
a file name, in which case the Make rules are written to that file,
guessing the target name from the source file name. Or the value can
have the form <em>file/* */target</em>, in which case the rules are written
to file <em>file</em> using <em>target</em> as the target name. In other words, this
environment variable is equivalent to combining the options <strong>-MM</strong> and
<strong>-MF</strong>, with an optional <strong>-MT</strong> switch too.</dd>
<dt>
SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES
</dt>
<dd>This variable is the same as
<strong>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</strong> (see above), except that system header files are
not ignored, so it implies <strong>-M</strong> rather than <strong>-MM</strong>. However, the
dependence on the main input file is omitted.</dd>
<dt>
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
</dt>
<dd>If this variable is set, its value specifies a
UNIX timestamp to be used in replacement of the current date and time
in the <code class="verbatim">_ _DATE_ _</code> and <code class="verbatim">_ _TIME_ _</code> macros, so that the embedded
timestamps become reproducible. The value of <strong>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</strong> must
be a UNIX timestamp, defined as the number of seconds (excluding leap
seconds) since 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 represented in ASCII; identical to
the output of <code class="verbatim">date +%s</code> on GNU/Linux and other systems that support
the <code class="verbatim">%s</code> extension in the <code class="verbatim">date</code> command. The value should be a known
timestamp such as the last modification time of the source or package
and it should be set by the build process.</dd>

<li>On some systems, <strong>gcc -shared</strong> needs to build supplementary stub code
for constructors to work. On multi-libbed systems, <strong>gcc -shared</strong> must
select the correct support libraries to link against. Failing to
supply the correct flags may lead to subtle defects. Supplying them
in cases where they are not necessary is innocuous. <strong>-shared</strong>
