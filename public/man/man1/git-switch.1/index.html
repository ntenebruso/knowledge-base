DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Switch to a specified branch. The working tree and the index are updated
to match the branch. All new commits will be added to the tip of this
branch.</p>
<p>
Optionally a new branch could be created with either <strong>-c</strong>, <strong>-C</strong>,
automatically from a remote branch of same name (see <strong>–guess</strong>), or
detach the working tree from any branch with <strong>–detach</strong>, along with
switching.</p>
<p>
Switching branches does not require a clean index and working tree (i.e.
no differences compared to <strong>HEAD</strong>). The operation is aborted however if
the operation leads to loss of local changes, unless told otherwise with
<strong>–discard-changes</strong> or <strong>–merge</strong>.</p>
<p>
THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. THE BEHAVIOR MAY CHANGE.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>&lt;branch&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Branch to switch to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;new-branch&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Name for the new branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&lt;start-point&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The starting point for the new branch. Specifying a <strong>&lt;start-point&gt;</strong>
allows you to create a branch based on some other point in history than
where HEAD currently points. (Or, in the case of <strong>–detach</strong>, allows you
to inspect and detach from some other point.)</p>
<p>
You can use the <strong>@{-N}</strong> syntax to refer to the N-th last branch/commit
switched to using &#34;git switch&#34; or &#34;git checkout&#34; operation. You may also
specify <strong>-</strong> which is synonymous to <strong>@{-1}</strong>. This is often used to switch
quickly between two branches, or to undo a branch switch by mistake.</p>
<p>
As a special case, you may use <strong>A…B</strong> as a shortcut for the merge base
of <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> if there is exactly one merge base. You can leave out at
most one of <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, in which case it defaults to <strong>HEAD</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-c &lt;new-branch&gt;, –create &lt;new-branch&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a new branch named <strong>&lt;new-branch&gt;</strong> starting at <strong>&lt;start-point&gt;</strong>
before switching to the branch. This is the transactional equivalent of</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git branch &lt;new-branch&gt;
$ git switch &lt;new-branch&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
that is to say, the branch is not reset/created unless &#34;git switch&#34; is
successful (e.g., when the branch is in use in another worktree, not
just the current branch stays the same, but the branch is not reset to
the start-point, either).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-C &lt;new-branch&gt;, –force-create &lt;new-branch&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similar to <strong>–create</strong> except that if <strong>&lt;new-branch&gt;</strong> already exists, it
will be reset to <strong>&lt;start-point&gt;</strong>. This is a convenient shortcut for:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git branch -f &lt;new-branch&gt;
$ git switch &lt;new-branch&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
-d, –detach</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Switch to a commit for inspection and discardable experiments. See the
&#34;DETACHED HEAD&#34; section in *git-checkout*(1) for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–guess, –no-guess</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong> is not found but there does exist a tracking branch in
exactly one remote (call it <strong>&lt;remote&gt;</strong>) with a matching name, treat as
equivalent to</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git switch -c &lt;branch&gt; --track &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If the branch exists in multiple remotes and one of them is named by the
<strong>checkout.defaultRemote</strong> configuration variable, we&#39;ll use that one for
the purposes of disambiguation, even if the <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong> isn&#39;t unique
across all remotes. Set it to e.g. <strong>checkout.defaultRemote=origin</strong> to
always checkout remote branches from there if <strong>&lt;branch&gt;</strong> is ambiguous
but exists on the <em>origin</em> remote. See also <strong>checkout.defaultRemote</strong> in
*git-config*(1).</p>
<p>
<strong>–guess</strong> is the default behavior. Use <strong>–no-guess</strong> to disable it.</p>
<p>
The default behavior can be set via the <strong>checkout.guess</strong> configuration
variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-f, –force</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An alias for <strong>–discard-changes</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–discard-changes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proceed even if the index or the working tree differs from <strong>HEAD</strong>. Both
the index and working tree are restored to match the switching target.
If <strong>–recurse-submodules</strong> is specified, submodule content is also
restored to match the switching target. This is used to throw away local
changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-m, –merge</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have local modifications to one or more files that are different
between the current branch and the branch to which you are switching,
the command refuses to switch branches in order to preserve your
modifications in context. However, with this option, a three-way merge
between the current branch, your working tree contents, and the new
branch is done, and you will be on the new branch.</p>
<p>
When a merge conflict happens, the index entries for conflicting paths
are left unmerged, and you need to resolve the conflicts and mark the
resolved paths with <strong>git add</strong> (or <strong>git rm</strong> if the merge should result in
deletion of the path).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–conflict=&lt;style&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same as <strong>–merge</strong> option above, but changes the way the conflicting
hunks are presented, overriding the <strong>merge.conflictStyle</strong> configuration
variable. Possible values are &#34;merge&#34; (default), &#34;diff3&#34;, and &#34;zdiff3&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-q, –quiet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quiet, suppress feedback messages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–progress, –no-progress</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default when
it is attached to a terminal, unless <strong>–quiet</strong> is specified. This flag
enables progress reporting even if not attached to a terminal,
regardless of <strong>–quiet</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
-t, –track [direct|inherit]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When creating a new branch, set up &#34;upstream&#34; configuration. <strong>-c</strong> is
implied. See <strong>–track</strong> in *git-branch*(1) for details.</p>
<p>
If no <strong>-c</strong> option is given, the name of the new branch will be derived
from the remote-tracking branch, by looking at the local part of the
refspec configured for the corresponding remote, and then stripping the
initial part up to the &#34;<strong>&#34;. This would tell us to use *hack</strong> as the
local branch when branching off of <strong>origin/hack</strong> (or
<strong>remotes/origin/hack</strong>, or even <strong>refs/remotes/origin/hack</strong>). If the given
name has no slash, or the above guessing results in an empty name, the
guessing is aborted. You can explicitly give a name with <strong>-c</strong> in such a
case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–no-track</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not set up &#34;upstream&#34; configuration, even if the
<strong>branch.autoSetupMerge</strong> configuration variable is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–orphan &lt;new-branch&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a new unborn branch, named <strong>&lt;new-branch&gt;</strong>. All tracked files are
removed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–ignore-other-worktrees</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>git switch</strong> refuses when the wanted ref is already checked out by
another worktree. This option makes it check the ref out anyway. In
other words, the ref can be held by more than one worktree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
–recurse-submodules, –no-recurse-submodules</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using <strong>–recurse-submodules</strong> will update the content of all active
submodules according to the commit recorded in the superproject. If
nothing (or <strong>–no-recurse-submodules</strong>) is used, submodules working trees
will not be updated. Just like <strong>git-submodule*(1), this will detach
*HEAD</strong> of the submodules.</p>

EXAMPLES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The following command switches to the &#34;master&#34; branch:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git switch master
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
After working in the wrong branch, switching to the correct branch would
be done using:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git switch mytopic
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, your &#34;wrong&#34; branch and correct &#34;mytopic&#34; branch may differ in
files that you have modified locally, in which case the above switch
would fail like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git switch mytopic
error: You have local changes to frotz; not switching branches.
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
You can give the <strong>-m</strong> flag to the command, which would try a three-way
merge:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git switch -m mytopic
Auto-merging frotz
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
After this three-way merge, the local modifications are <em>not</em> registered
in your index file, so <strong>git diff</strong> would show you what changes you made
since the tip of the new branch.</p>
<p>
To switch back to the previous branch before we switched to mytopic
(i.e. &#34;master&#34; branch):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git switch -
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
You can grow a new branch from any commit. For example, switch to
&#34;HEAD~3&#34; and create branch &#34;fixup&#34;:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git switch -c fixup HEAD~3
Switched to a new branch fixup
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you want to start a new branch from a remote branch of the same name:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git switch new-topic
Branch new-topic set up to track remote branch new-topic from origin
Switched to a new branch new-topic
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
To check out commit <strong>HEAD~3</strong> for temporary inspection or experiment
without creating a new branch:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git switch --detach HEAD~3
HEAD is now at 9fc9555312 Merge branch cc/shared-index-permbits
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
If it turns out whatever you have done is worth keeping, you can always
create a new name for it (without switching away):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
$ git switch -c good-surprises
</pre>

checkout.defaultRemote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you run <strong>git checkout &lt;something&gt;</strong> or <strong>git switch &lt;something&gt;</strong> and
only have one remote, it may implicitly fall back on checking out and
tracking e.g. <strong>origin/&lt;something&gt;</strong>. This stops working as soon as you
have more than one remote with a <strong>&lt;something&gt;</strong> reference. This setting
allows for setting the name of a preferred remote that should always win
when it comes to disambiguation. The typical use-case is to set this to
<strong>origin</strong>.</p>
<p>
Currently this is used by <strong>git-switch*(1) and *git-checkout*(1) when
*git checkout &lt;something&gt;</strong> or <strong>git switch &lt;something&gt;</strong> will checkout the
<strong>&lt;something&gt;</strong> branch on another remote, and by <strong>git-worktree*(1) when
*git worktree add</strong> refers to a remote branch. This setting might be used
for other checkout-like commands or functionality in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
checkout.guess</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provides the default value for the <strong>–guess</strong> or <strong>–no-guess</strong> option in
<strong>git checkout</strong> and <strong>git switch</strong>. See *git-switch*(1) and
*git-checkout*(1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
checkout.workers</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of parallel workers to use when updating the working tree.
The default is one, i.e. sequential execution. If set to a value less
than one, Git will use as many workers as the number of logical cores
available. This setting and <strong>checkout.thresholdForParallelism</strong> affect
all commands that perform checkout. E.g. checkout, clone, reset,
sparse-checkout, etc.</p>
<p>
Note: Parallel checkout usually delivers better performance for
repositories located on SSDs or over NFS. For repositories on spinning
disks and/or machines with a small number of cores, the default
sequential checkout often performs better. The size and compression
level of a repository might also influence how well the parallel version
performs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
checkout.thresholdForParallelism</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When running parallel checkout with a small number of files, the cost of
subprocess spawning and inter-process communication might outweigh the
parallelization gains. This setting allows you to define the minimum
number of files for which parallel checkout should be attempted. The
default is 100.</p>
