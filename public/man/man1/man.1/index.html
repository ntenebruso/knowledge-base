DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>man</strong> is the system&#39;s manual pager. Each <em>page</em> argument given to <strong>man</strong>
is normally the name of a program, utility or function. The <em>manual
page</em> associated with each of these arguments is then found and
displayed. A <em>section</em>, if provided, will direct <strong>man</strong> to look only in
that <em>section</em> of the manual. The default action is to search in all of
the available <em>sections</em> following a pre-defined order (see <strong>DEFAULTS</strong>),
and to show only the first <em>page</em> found, even if <em>page</em> exists in
several <em>sections</em>.</p>
<p>
The table below shows the <em>section</em> numbers of the manual followed by
the types of pages they contain.</p>
<table>

<p>
A manual <em>page</em> consists of several sections.</p>
<p>
Conventional section names include <strong>NAME</strong>, <strong>SYNOPSIS</strong>, <strong>CONFIGURATION</strong>,
<strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>, <strong>OPTIONS</strong>, <strong>EXIT STATUS</strong>, <strong>RETURN VALUE</strong>, <strong>ERRORS</strong>,
<strong>ENVIRONMENT</strong>, <strong>FILES</strong>, <strong>VERSIONS</strong>, <strong>STANDARDS</strong>, <strong>NOTES</strong>, <strong>BUGS</strong>,
<strong>EXAMPLE</strong>, <strong>AUTHORS</strong>, and <strong>SEE ALSO</strong>.</p>
<p>
The following conventions apply to the <strong>SYNOPSIS</strong> section and can be
used as a guide in other sections.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>bold text</strong></td>
<td>type exactly as shown.</td>

<p>
Exact rendering may vary depending on the output device. For instance,
man will usually not be able to render italics when running in a
terminal, and will typically use underlined or coloured text instead.</p>
<p>
The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all
possible invocations. In some cases it is advisable to illustrate
several exclusive invocations as is shown in the <strong>SYNOPSIS</strong> section of
this manual page.</p>

EXAMPLES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<dl>
<dt>
*man*/ ls/
</dt>
<dd>Display the manual page for the <em>item</em> (program) <em>ls</em>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>man</strong> <em>man</em>./7/
</dt>
<dd>Display the manual page for macro package <em>man</em>
from section <em>7</em>. (This is an alternative spelling of &#34;<strong>man</strong> <em>7
man</em>&#34;.)</dd>
<dt>
*man &#39;*/man/(<em>7</em>)&#39;
</dt>
<dd>Display the manual page for macro package <em>man</em>
from section <em>7</em>. (This is another alternative spelling of &#34;<strong>man</strong> <em>7
man</em>&#34;. It may be more convenient when copying and pasting
cross-references to manual pages. Note that the parentheses must
normally be quoted to protect them from the shell.)</dd>
<dt>
*man -a*/ intro/
</dt>
<dd>Display, in succession, all of the available
<em>intro</em> manual pages contained within the manual. It is possible to
quit between successive displays or skip any of them.</dd>
<dt>
*man -t */bash <em>|</em> lpr -Pps/
</dt>
<dd>Format the manual page for <em>bash</em> into
the default <strong>troff</strong> or <strong>groff</strong> format and pipe it to the printer named
<em>ps</em>. The default output for <strong>groff</strong> is usually PostScript. <strong>man
–help</strong> should advise as to which processor is bound to the <strong>-t</strong>
option.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>man -l -T*/dvi ./foo.1x.gz/</strong> &gt; */./foo.1x.dvi/
</dt>
<dd>This command will
decompress and format the nroff source manual page <em>./foo.1x.gz</em> into
a <strong>device independent (dvi)</strong> file. The redirection is necessary as the
<strong>-T</strong> flag causes output to be directed to <strong>stdout</strong> with no pager. The
output could be viewed with a program such as <strong>xdvi</strong> or further
processed into PostScript using a program such as <strong>dvips</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
*man -k*/ printf/
</dt>
<dd>Search the short descriptions and manual page
names for the keyword <em>printf</em> as regular expression. Print out any
matches. Equivalent to <strong>apropos*/ printf/</strong>.*</dd>
<dt>
*man -f*/ smail/

OVERVIEW
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Many options are available to <strong>man</strong> in order to give as much flexibility
as possible to the user. Changes can be made to the search path, section
order, output processor, and other behaviours and operations detailed
below.</p>
<p>
If set, various environment variables are interrogated to determine the
operation of <strong>man</strong>. It is possible to set the &#34;catch-all&#34; variable
$*MANOPT* to any string in command line format, with the exception that
any spaces used as part of an option&#39;s argument must be escaped
(preceded by a backslash). *man* will parse $*MANOPT* prior to parsing
its own command line. Those options requiring an argument will be
overridden by the same options found on the command line. To reset all
of the options set in $*MANOPT*, *-D* can be specified as the initial
command line option. This will allow man to &#34;forget&#34; about the options
specified in $*MANOPT*, although they must still have been valid.</p>
<p>
Manual pages are normally stored in *nroff*(1) format under a directory
such as <em>/usr/share/man</em>. In some installations, there may also be
preformatted <em>cat pages</em> to improve performance. See *manpath*(5) for
details of where these files are stored.</p>
<p>
This package supports manual pages in multiple languages, controlled by
your <em>locale</em>. If your system did not set this up for you automatically,
then you may need to set $*LC_MESSAGES*, $*LANG*, or another
system-dependent environment variable to indicate your preferred locale,
usually specified in the <strong>POSIX</strong> format:</p>
<p>
&lt;/language/&gt;[ *_*&lt;/territory/&gt; [ *.*&lt;/character-set/&gt; [ *,*&lt;/version/&gt; ] ] ]</p>
<p>
If the desired page is available in your <em>locale</em>, it will be displayed
in lieu of the standard (usually American English) page.</p>
<p>
If you find that the translations supplied with this package are not
available in your native language and you would like to supply them,
please contact the maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.</p>
<p>
Individual manual pages are normally written and maintained by the
maintainers of the program, function, or other topic that they document,
and are not included with this package. If you find that a manual page
is missing or inadequate, please report that to the maintainers of the
package in question.</p>
<p>
For information regarding other features and extensions available with
this manual pager, please read the documents supplied with the package.</p>

<h2 id="headline-6">
DEFAULTS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The order of sections to search may be overridden by the environment
variable $*MANSECT* or by the <strong>SECTION</strong> directive in
<em>/nix/store/fj110lfz7yfgdv7yv5pcb0n3af7i4gjk-man-db-2.12.1/etc/man_db.conf</em>.
By default it is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 n l 8 3 0 2 5 4 9 6 7</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The formatted manual page is displayed using a <em>pager</em>. This can be
specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default (see
option <strong>-P</strong> for details).</p>
<p>
The filters are deciphered by a number of means. Firstly, the command
line option <strong>-p</strong> or the environment variable $*MANROFFSEQ* is
interrogated. If <strong>-p</strong> was not used and the environment variable was not
set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor
string. To contain a valid preprocessor string, the first line must
resemble</p>
<p>
<strong>&#39;\&#34;</strong> &lt;*string*&gt;</p>
<p>
where <strong>string</strong> can be any combination of letters described by option
<strong>-p</strong> below.</p>
<p>
If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default
set is used.</p>
<p>
A formatting pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary
formatter (<strong>nroff</strong> or [*tg*]*roff* with <strong>-t</strong>) and executed.
Alternatively, if an executable program <em>mandb_nfmt</em> (or <em>mandb_tfmt</em>
with <strong>-t</strong>) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead. It gets
passed the manual source file, the preprocessor string, and optionally
the device specified with <strong>-T</strong> or <strong>-E</strong> as arguments.</p>

OPTIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Non-argument options that are duplicated either on the command line, in
$*MANOPT*, or both, are not harmful. For options that require an
argument, each duplication will override the previous argument value.</p>

General options
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-3">
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-C */file/</strong>, *–config-file=**/file/
</dt>
<dd>Use this user configuration
file rather than the default of <em>~</em>.manpath/.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-d</strong>, <strong>–debug</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Print debugging information.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-D</strong>, <strong>–default</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option is normally issued as the very first
option and resets <strong>man&#39;s</strong> behaviour to its default. Its use is to
reset those options that may have been set in $*MANOPT*. Any options
that follow <strong>-D</strong> will have their usual effect.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–warnings[=*/warnings/*]</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Enable warnings from <em>groff</em>. This may
be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of manual pages.
<em>warnings</em> is a comma-separated list of warning names; if it is not
supplied, the default is &#34;mac&#34;. To disable a <em>groff</em> warning, prefix
it with &#34;!&#34;: for example, <strong>–warnings=mac,!break</strong> enables warnings in
the &#34;mac&#34; category and disables warnings in the &#34;break&#34; category. See
the “Warnings” node in <strong>info groff</strong> for a list of available warning
names.</dd>

Main modes of operation
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-3">
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-f</strong>, <strong>–whatis</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Approximately equivalent to <strong>whatis</strong>. Display a
short description from the manual page, if available. See *whatis*(1)
for details.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-k</strong>, <strong>–apropos</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Approximately equivalent to <strong>apropos</strong>. Search the
short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.
See *apropos*(1) for details.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-K</strong>, <strong>–global-apropos</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Search for text in all manual pages. This
is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time; if you can,
you should specify a section to reduce the number of pages that need
to be searched. Search terms may be simple strings (the default), or
regular expressions if the <strong>–regex</strong> option is used.

Note that this searches the <em>sources</em> of the manual pages, not the
rendered text, and so may include false positives due to things like
comments in source files, or false negatives due to things like
hyphens being written as &#34;\-&#34; in source files. Searching the rendered
text would be much slower.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-l</strong>, <strong>–local-file</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Activate &#34;local&#34; mode. Format and display
local manual files instead of searching through the system&#39;s manual
collection. Each manual page argument will be interpreted as an nroff
source file in the correct format. No cat file is produced. If &#39;-&#39; is
listed as one of the arguments, input will be taken from stdin.

If this option is not used, then <strong>man</strong> will also fall back to
interpreting manual page arguments as local file names if the argument
contains a &#34;/&#34; character, since that is a good indication that the
argument refers to a path on the file system.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-w</strong>, <strong>–where</strong>, <strong>–path</strong>, <strong>–location</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t actually display the
manual page, but do print the location of the source nroff file that
would be formatted. If the <strong>-a</strong> option is also used, then print the
locations of all source files that match the search criteria.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-W</strong>, <strong>–where-cat</strong>, <strong>–location-cat</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t actually display the
manual page, but do print the location of the preformatted cat file
that would be displayed. If the <strong>-a</strong> option is also used, then print
the locations of all preformatted cat files that match the search
criteria.

If <strong>-w</strong> and <strong>-W</strong> are both used, then print both source file and cat
file separated by a space. If all of <strong>-w</strong>, <strong>-W</strong>, and <strong>-a</strong> are used,
then do this for each possible match.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-c</strong>, <strong>–catman</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option is not for general use and should only
be used by the <strong>catman</strong> program.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-R */encoding, /</strong>–recode=/encoding/*
</dt>
<dd>Instead of formatting the
manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the
specified <em>encoding</em>. If you already know the encoding of the source
file, you can also use *manconv*(1) directly. However, this option
allows you to convert several manual pages to a single encoding
without having to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that
they were already installed in a structure similar to a manual page
hierarchy.

Consider using *man-recode*(1) instead for converting multiple manual
pages, since it has an interface designed for bulk conversion and so
can be much faster.</dd>

Finding manual pages
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-3">
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-L */locale/</strong>, *–locale=**/locale/
</dt>
<dd><strong>man</strong> will normally determine
your current locale by a call to the C function *setlocale*(3) which
interrogates various environment variables, possibly including
$*LC_MESSAGES* and $*LANG*. To temporarily override the determined
value, use this option to supply a <em>locale</em> string directly to <strong>man</strong>.
Note that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually
begins. Output such as the help message will always be displayed in
the initially determined locale.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-m</strong> <em>system</em> [ ,. . . ] , *–systems=*/system/ [ ,. . . ]
</dt>
<dd>If this
system has access to other operating systems&#39; manual pages, they can
be accessed using this option. To search for a manual page from
NewOS&#39;s manual page collection, use the option <strong>-m</strong> <strong>NewOS</strong>.

The <em>system</em> specified can be a combination of comma delimited
operating system names. To include a search of the native operating
system&#39;s manual pages, include the system name <strong>man</strong> in the argument
string. This option will override the $*SYSTEM* environment variable.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-M */path/</strong>, *–manpath=**/path/
</dt>
<dd>Specify an alternate manpath to
use. By default, <strong>man</strong> uses <strong>manpath</strong> derived code to determine the
path to search. This option overrides the $*MANPATH* environment
variable and causes option <strong>-m</strong> to be ignored.

A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page
hierarchy structured into sections as described in the man-db manual
(under &#34;The manual page system&#34;). To view manual pages outside such
hierarchies, see the <strong>-l</strong> option.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-S</strong> <em>list</em>, <strong>-s</strong> <em>list</em>, *–sections=*/list/
</dt>
<dd>The given <em>list</em> is a
colon- or comma-separated list of sections, used to determine which
manual sections to search and in what order. This option overrides the
$*MANSECT* environment variable. (The <strong>-s</strong> spelling is for
compatibility with System V.)</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-e */sub-extension/</strong>, *–extension=**/sub-extension/
</dt>
<dd>Some systems
incorporate large packages of manual pages, such as those that
accompany the <strong>Tcl</strong> package, into the main manual page hierarchy. To
get around the problem of having two manual pages with the same name
such as <strong>exit*(3), the *Tcl</strong> pages were usually all assigned to
section <strong>l</strong>. As this is unfortunate, it is now possible to put the
pages in the correct section, and to assign a specific &#34;extension&#34; to
them, in this case, <strong>exit*(3tcl). Under normal operation, *man</strong> will
display *exit*(3) in preference to *exit*(3tcl). To negotiate this
situation and to avoid having to know which section the page you
require resides in, it is now possible to give <strong>man</strong> a <em>sub-extension</em>
string indicating which package the page must belong to. Using the
above example, supplying the option <strong>-e tcl</strong> to <strong>man</strong> will restrict
the search to pages having an extension of <strong>*tcl</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-i</strong>, <strong>–ignore-case</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Ignore case when searching for manual pages.
This is the default.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-I</strong>, <strong>–match-case</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Search for manual pages case-sensitively.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–regex</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Show all pages with any part of either their names or
their descriptions matching each <em>page</em> argument as a regular
expression, as with *apropos*(1). Since there is usually no reasonable
way to pick a &#34;best&#34; page when searching for a regular expression,
this option implies <strong>-a</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–wildcard</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Show all pages with any part of either their names or
their descriptions matching each <em>page</em> argument using shell-style
wildcards, as with <strong>apropos*(1) *–wildcard</strong>. The <em>page</em> argument must
match the entire name or description, or match on word boundaries in
the description. Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a
&#34;best&#34; page when searching for a wildcard, this option implies <strong>-a</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–names-only</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If the <strong>–regex</strong> or <strong>–wildcard</strong> option is used,
match only page names, not page descriptions, as with *whatis*(1).
Otherwise, no effect.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-a</strong>, <strong>–all</strong>
</dt>
<dd>By default, <strong>man</strong> will exit after displaying the most
suitable manual page it finds. Using this option forces <strong>man</strong> to
display all the manual pages with names that match the search
criteria.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-u</strong>, <strong>–update</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option causes <strong>man</strong> to update its database
caches of installed manual pages. This is only needed in rare
situations, and it is normally better to run *mandb*(8) instead.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-subpages</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>By default, <strong>man</strong> will try to interpret pairs of
manual page names given on the command line as equivalent to a single
manual page name containing a hyphen or an underscore. This supports
the common pattern of programs that implement a number of subcommands,
allowing them to provide manual pages for each that can be accessed
using similar syntax as would be used to invoke the subcommands
themselves. For example:</p>
<pre class="example">
  $ man -aw git diff
  /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz
</pre>
<p>
To disable this behaviour, use the <strong>–no-subpages</strong> option.</p>
<pre class="example">
  $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
  /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
  /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
  /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-P */pager/</strong>, *–pager=**/pager/
</dt>
<dd>Specify which output pager to
use. By default, <strong>man</strong> uses <strong>less</strong>, falling back to <strong>cat</strong> if <strong>less</strong> is
not found or is not executable. This option overrides the $*MANPAGER*
environment variable, which in turn overrides the $*PAGER* environment
variable. It is not used in conjunction with <strong>-f</strong> or <strong>-k</strong>.

The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments,
and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double
quotes). It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you
need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display
either as an argument or on standard input.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-r */prompt/</strong>, *–prompt=**/prompt/
</dt>
<dd>
<p>If a recent version of <strong>less</strong>
is used as the pager, <strong>man</strong> will attempt to set its prompt and some
sensible options. The default prompt looks like</p>
<ul>
<li>Manual page*/ name/*(<strong><em>sec</em></strong>) line*/ x/</li>
</ul>
<p>where <em>name</em> denotes the manual page name, <em>sec</em> denotes the section
it was found under and <em>x</em> the current line number. This is achieved
by using the $*LESS* environment variable.</p>
<p>
Supplying <strong>-r</strong> with a string will override this default. The string
may contain the text <strong>$MAN_PN</strong> which will be expanded to the name of
the current manual page and its section name surrounded by &#34;(&#34; and
&#34;)&#34;. The string used to produce the default could be expressed as</p>
<p>
<strong>\ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:</strong><br>
<strong>byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..</strong><br>
<strong>(press h for help or q to quit)</strong></p>
<p>
It is broken into three lines here for the sake of readability only.
For its meaning see the *less*(1) manual page. The prompt string is
first evaluated by the shell. All double quotes, back-quotes and
backslashes in the prompt must be escaped by a preceding backslash.
The prompt string may end in an escaped $ which may be followed by
further options for less. By default <strong>man</strong> sets the <strong>-ix8</strong> options.</p>
<p>
The $*MANLESS* environment variable described below may be used to set
a default prompt string if none is supplied on the command line.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-7</strong>, <strong>–ascii</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When viewing a pure /ascii/(7) manual page on a 7
bit terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may not display
correctly when using the <em>latin1/(7) device description with <strong>GNU</strong>
<strong>nroff</strong>. This option allows pure /ascii</em> manual pages to be displayed
in <em>ascii</em> with the <em>latin1</em> device. It will not translate any
<em>latin1</em> text. The following table shows the translations performed:
some parts of it may only be displayed properly when using <strong>GNU</strong>
<strong>nroff</strong>&#39;s /latin1/(7) device.</dd>

If the <em>latin1</em> column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up
for <em>latin1</em> characters and this option is not necessary. If the
<em>latin1</em> and <em>ascii</em> columns are identical, you are reading this page
using this option or <strong>man</strong> did not format this page using the <em>latin1</em>
device description. If the <em>latin1</em> column is missing or corrupt, you
may need to view manual pages with this option.</p>
<p>
This option is ignored when using options <strong>-t</strong>, <strong>-H</strong>, <strong>-T</strong>, or <strong>-Z</strong> and
may be useless for <strong>nroff</strong> other than <strong>GNU&#39;s</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-E */encoding, /</strong>–encoding=/encoding/*
</dt>
<dd>Generate output for a
character encoding other than the default. For backward compatibility,
<em>encoding</em> may be an <strong>nroff</strong> device such as <strong>ascii</strong>, <strong>latin1</strong>, or
<strong>utf8</strong> as well as a true character encoding such as <strong>UTF-8</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-hyphenation</strong>, <strong>–nh</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Normally, <strong>nroff</strong> will automatically
hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not contain
hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to lay out words on a line
without excessive spacing. This option disables automatic hyphenation,
so words will only be hyphenated if they already contain hyphens.

If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent <strong>nroff</strong>
from hyphenating a word at an inappropriate point, do not use this
option, but consult the <strong>nroff</strong> documentation instead; for instance,
you can put &#34;\%&#34; inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated
at that point, or put &#34;\%&#34; at the start of a word to prevent it from
being hyphenated.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>–no-justification</strong>, <strong>–nj</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Normally, <strong>nroff</strong> will automatically
justify text to both margins. This option disables full justification,
leaving justified only to the left margin, sometimes called
&#34;ragged-right&#34; text.

If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent <strong>nroff</strong>
from justifying certain paragraphs, do not use this option, but
consult the <strong>nroff</strong> documentation instead; for instance, you can use
the &#34;.na&#34;, &#34;.nf&#34;, &#34;.fi&#34;, and &#34;.ad&#34; requests to temporarily disable
adjusting and filling.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-p */string/</strong>, *–preprocessor=**/string/
</dt>
<dd>Specify the sequence of
preprocessors to run before <strong>nroff</strong> or <strong>troff*/*groff</strong>. Not all
installations will have a full set of preprocessors. Some of the
preprocessors and the letters used to designate them are: <strong>eqn</strong> (<strong>e</strong>),
<strong>grap</strong> (<strong>g</strong>), <strong>pic</strong> (<strong>p</strong>), <strong>tbl</strong> (<strong>t</strong>), <strong>vgrind</strong> (<strong>v</strong>), <strong>refer</strong> (<strong>r</strong>).
This option overrides the $*MANROFFSEQ* environment variable.
<strong>zsoelim</strong> is always run as the very first preprocessor.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-t</strong>, <strong>–troff</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Use <em>groff -mandoc</em> to format the manual page to
stdout. This option is not required in conjunction with <strong>-H</strong>, <strong>-T</strong>, or
<strong>-Z</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-T[*/device/*], –troff-device[=*/device/*]</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option is used
to change <strong>groff</strong> (or possibly <strong>troff&#39;s</strong>) output to be suitable for a
device other than the default. It implies <strong>-t</strong>. Examples (as of groff
1.23.0) include <strong>dvi</strong>, <strong>latin1</strong>, <strong>pdf</strong>, <strong>ps</strong>, <strong>utf8</strong>, <strong>X75</strong> and
<strong>X100</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-H[*/browser/*], –html[=*/browser/*]</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option will cause
<strong>groff</strong> to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web
browser. The choice of browser is determined by the optional <em>browser</em>
argument if one is provided, by the $*BROWSER* environment variable,
or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually <strong>lynx</strong>). This
option implies <strong>-t</strong>, and will only work with <strong>GNU</strong> <strong>troff</strong>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-X[*/dpi/*], –gxditview[=*/dpi/*]</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This option displays the
output of <strong>groff</strong> in a graphical window using the <strong>gxditview</strong> program.
The <em>dpi</em> (dots per inch) may be 75, 75-12, 100, or 100-12, defaulting
to 75; the -12 variants use a 12-point base font. This option implies
<strong>-T</strong> with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device respectively.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-Z</strong>, <strong>–ditroff</strong>
</dt>
<dd><strong>groff</strong> will run <strong>troff</strong> and then use an
appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for the chosen
device. If <em>groff -mandoc</em> is <strong>groff</strong>, this option is passed to
<strong>groff</strong> and will suppress the use of a post-processor. It implies
<strong>-t</strong>.</dd>

ENVIRONMENT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-2">
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>MANPATH</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If $*MANPATH* is set, its value is used as the path to
search for manual pages.

See the <strong>SEARCH PATH</strong> section of *manpath*(5) for the default
behaviour and details of how this environment variable is handled.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MANROFFOPT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Every time <strong>man</strong> invokes the formatter (<strong>nroff</strong>,
<strong>troff</strong>, or <strong>groff</strong>), it adds the contents of $*MANROFFOPT* to the
formatter&#39;s command line.

For example, <strong>MANROFFOPT=-P-i</strong> tells the formatter to use italic text
(which is only supported by some terminals) rather than underlined
text.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MANROFFSEQ</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If $*MANROFFSEQ* is set, its value is used to
determine the set of preprocessors to pass each manual page through.
The default preprocessor list is system dependent.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MANSECT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If $*MANSECT* is set, its value is a colon-delimited list
of sections and it is used to determine which manual sections to
search and in what order. The default is &#34;1 n l 8 3 0 2 5 4 9 6 7&#34;,
unless overridden by the <strong>SECTION</strong> directive in
<em>/nix/store/fj110lfz7yfgdv7yv5pcb0n3af7i4gjk-man-db-2.12.1/etc/man_db.conf</em>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MANPAGER</strong>,* PAGER*
</dt>
<dd>If $*MANPAGER* or $*PAGER* is set ($*MANPAGER*
is used in preference), its value is used as the name of the program
used to display the manual page. By default, <strong>less</strong> is used, falling
back to <strong>cat</strong> if <strong>less</strong> is not found or is not executable.

The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments,
and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double
quotes). It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you
need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display
either as an argument or on standard input.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MANLESS</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If $*MANLESS* is set, its value will be used as the
default prompt string for the *less* pager, as if it had been passed
using the *-r* option (so any occurrences of the text *$MAN_PN* will
be expanded in the same way). For example, if you want to set the
prompt string unconditionally to “my prompt string”, set $*MANLESS* to
‘*-Psmy prompt string*&#39;. Using the <strong>-r</strong> option overrides this
environment variable.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>BROWSER</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If $*BROWSER* is set, its value is a colon-delimited list
of commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a web
browser for <strong>man</strong> <strong>–html</strong>. In each command, <em>%s</em> is replaced by a
filename containing the HTML output from <strong>groff</strong>, <em>%%</em> is replaced by
a single percent sign (%), and <em>%c</em> is replaced by a colon (:).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>SYSTEM</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If $*SYSTEM* is set, it will have the same effect as if it
had been specified as the argument to the <strong>-m</strong> option.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MANOPT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If $*MANOPT* is set, it will be parsed prior to *man&#39;s*
command line and is expected to be in a similar format. As all of the
other *man* specific environment variables can be expressed as command
line options, and are thus candidates for being included in $*MANOPT*
it is expected that they will become obsolete. N.B. All spaces that
should be interpreted as part of an option&#39;s argument must be escaped.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MANWIDTH</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If $*MANWIDTH* is set, its value is used as the line
length for which manual pages should be formatted. If it is not set,
manual pages will be formatted with a line length appropriate to the
current terminal (using the value of $*COLUMNS*, and *ioctl*(2) if
available, or falling back to 80 characters if neither is available).
Cat pages will only be saved when the default formatting can be used,
that is when the terminal line length is between 66 and 80 characters.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Normally, when output is not being directed
to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are
discarded to make it easier to read the result without special tools.
However, if $*MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING* is set to any non-empty value,
these formatting characters are retained. This may be useful for
wrappers around <strong>man</strong> that can interpret formatting characters.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MAN_KEEP_STDERR</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Normally, when output is being directed to a
terminal (usually to a pager), any error output from the command used
to produce formatted versions of manual pages is discarded to avoid
interfering with the pager&#39;s display. Programs such as <strong>groff</strong> often
produce relatively minor error messages about typographical problems
such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally confusing
when displayed along with the manual page. However, some users want to
see them anyway, so, if $*MAN_KEEP_STDERR* is set to any non-empty
value, error output will be displayed as usual.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>MAN_DISABLE_SECCOMP</strong>
</dt>
<dd>On Linux, <strong>man</strong> normally confines
subprocesses that handle untrusted data using a *seccomp*(2) sandbox.
This makes it safer to run complex parsing code over arbitrary manual
pages. If this goes wrong for some reason unrelated to the content of
the page being displayed, you can set $*MAN_DISABLE_SECCOMP* to any
non-empty value to disable the sandbox.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>PIPELINE_DEBUG</strong>
</dt>
<dd>If the $*PIPELINE_DEBUG* environment variable is
set to &#34;1&#34;, then <strong>man</strong> will print debugging messages to standard error
describing each subprocess it runs.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>LANG</strong>,* LC_MESSAGES*
</dt>
<dd>Depending on system and implementation,
either or both of $*LANG* and $*LC_MESSAGES* will be interrogated for
the current message locale. <strong>man</strong> will display its messages in that
locale (if available). See *setlocale*(3) for precise details.</dd>
