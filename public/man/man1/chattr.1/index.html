DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>chattr</strong> changes the file attributes on a Linux file system.</p>
<p>
The format of a symbolic <em>mode</em> is <strong>+-=</strong>[*aAcCdDeFijmPsStTux*].</p>
<p>
The operator &#39;<strong>+</strong>&#39; causes the selected attributes to be added to the
existing attributes of the files; &#39;<strong>-</strong>&#39; causes them to be removed; and
&#39;<strong>=</strong>&#39; causes them to be the only attributes that the files have.</p>
<p>
The letters &#39;<strong>aAcCdDeFijmPsStTux</strong>&#39; select the new attributes for the
files: append only (<strong>a</strong>), no atime updates (<strong>A</strong>), compressed (<strong>c</strong>), no
copy on write (<strong>C</strong>), no dump (<strong>d</strong>), synchronous directory updates (<strong>D</strong>),
extent format (<strong>e</strong>), case-insensitive directory lookups (<strong>F</strong>), immutable
(<strong>i</strong>), data journaling (<strong>j</strong>), don&#39;t compress (<strong>m</strong>), project hierarchy
(<strong>P</strong>), secure deletion (<strong>s</strong>), synchronous updates (<strong>S</strong>), no tail-merging
(<strong>t</strong>), top of directory hierarchy (<strong>T</strong>), undeletable (<strong>u</strong>), and direct
access for files (<strong>x</strong>).</p>
<p>
The following attributes are read-only, and may be listed by <strong>lsattr*(1)
but not modified by chattr: encrypted (*E</strong>), indexed directory (<strong>I</strong>),
inline data (<strong>N</strong>), and verity (<strong>V</strong>).</p>
<p>
Not all flags are supported or utilized by all file systems; refer to
file system-specific man pages such as *btrfs*(5), *ext4*(5),
*mkfs.f2fs*(8), and *xfs*(5) for more file system-specific details.</p>

ATTRIBUTES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>a</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A file with the &#39;a&#39; attribute set can only be opened in append
mode for writing. Only the superuser or a process possessing the
CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can set or clear this attribute.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>A</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When a file with the &#39;A&#39; attribute set is accessed, its atime
record is not modified. This avoids a certain amount of disk I/O for
laptop systems.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>c</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A file with the &#39;c&#39; attribute set is automatically compressed
on the disk by the kernel. A read from this file returns uncompressed
data. A write to this file compresses data before storing them on the
disk. Note: please make sure to read the bugs and limitations section
at the end of this document. (Note: For btrfs, If the &#39;c&#39; flag is set,
then the &#39;C&#39; flag cannot be set. Also conflicts with btrfs mount
option &#39;nodatasum&#39;)</dd>
<dt>
<strong>C</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A file with the &#39;C&#39; attribute set will not be subject to
copy-on-write updates. This flag is only supported on file systems
which perform copy-on-write. (Note: For btrfs, the &#39;C&#39; flag should be
set on new or empty files. If it is set on a file which already has
data blocks, it is undefined when the blocks assigned to the file will
be fully stable. If the &#39;C&#39; flag is set on a directory, it will have
no effect on the directory, but new files created in that directory
will have the No_COW attribute set. If the &#39;C&#39; flag is set, then the
&#39;c&#39; flag cannot be set.)</dd>
<dt>
<strong>d</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A file with the &#39;d&#39; attribute set is not a candidate for backup
when the *dump*(8) program is run.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>D</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When a directory with the &#39;D&#39; attribute set is modified, the
changes are written synchronously to the disk; this is equivalent to
the &#39;dirsync&#39; mount option applied to a subset of the files.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>e</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The &#39;e&#39; attribute indicates that the file is using extents for
mapping the blocks on disk. It may not be removed using *chattr*(1).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>E</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A file, directory, or symlink with the &#39;E&#39; attribute set is
encrypted by the file system. This attribute may not be set or cleared
using *chattr*(1), although it can be displayed by *lsattr*(1).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>F</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A directory with the &#39;F&#39; attribute set indicates that all the
path lookups inside that directory are made in a case-insensitive
fashion. This attribute can only be changed in empty directories on
file systems with the casefold feature enabled.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>i</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A file with the &#39;i&#39; attribute cannot be modified: it cannot be
deleted or renamed, no link can be created to this file, most of the
file&#39;s metadata can not be modified, and the file can not be opened in
write mode. Only the superuser or a process possessing the
CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can set or clear this attribute.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>I</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The &#39;I&#39; attribute is used by the htree code to indicate that a
directory is being indexed using hashed trees. It may not be set or
cleared using *chattr*(1), although it can be displayed by
*lsattr*(1).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>j</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A file with the &#39;j&#39; attribute has all of its data written to
the ext3 or ext4 journal before being written to the file itself, if
the file system is mounted with the &#34;data=ordered&#34; or &#34;data=writeback&#34;
options and the file system has a journal. When the file system is
mounted with the &#34;data=journal&#34; option all file data is already
journalled and this attribute has no effect. Only the superuser or a
process possessing the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability can set or clear
this attribute.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>m</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A file with the &#39;m&#39; attribute is excluded from compression on
file systems that support per-file compression.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>N</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A file with the &#39;N&#39; attribute set indicates that the file has
data stored inline, within the inode itself. It may not be set or
cleared using *chattr*(1), although it can be displayed by
*lsattr*(1).</dd>
<dt>
<strong>P</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A directory with the &#39;P&#39; attribute set will enforce a
hierarchical structure for project id&#39;s. This means that files and
directories created in the directory will inherit the project id of
the directory, rename operations are constrained so when a file or
directory is moved into another directory, that the project ids must
match. In addition, a hard link to file can only be created when the
project id for the file and the destination directory match.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>s</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When a file with the &#39;s&#39; attribute set is deleted, its blocks
are zeroed and written back to the disk. Note: please make sure to
read the bugs and limitations section at the end of this document.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>S</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When a file with the &#39;S&#39; attribute set is modified, the changes
are written synchronously to the disk; this is equivalent to the
&#39;sync&#39; mount option applied to a subset of the files.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>t</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A file with the &#39;t&#39; attribute will not have a partial block
fragment at the end of the file merged with other files (for those
file systems which support tail-merging). This is necessary for
applications such as LILO which read the file system directly, and
which don&#39;t understand tail-merged files. Note: As of this writing,
the ext2, ext3, and ext4 file systems do not support tail-merging.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>T</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A directory with the &#39;T&#39; attribute will be deemed to be the top
of directory hierarchies for the purposes of the Orlov block
allocator. This is a hint to the block allocator used by ext3 and ext4
that the subdirectories under this directory are not related, and thus
should be spread apart for allocation purposes. For example it is a
very good idea to set the &#39;T&#39; attribute on the /home directory, so
that /home/john and /home/mary are placed into separate block groups.
For directories where this attribute is not set, the Orlov block
allocator will try to group subdirectories closer together where
possible.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>u</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When a file with the &#39;u&#39; attribute set is deleted, its contents
are saved. This allows the user to ask for its undeletion. Note:
please make sure to read the bugs and limitations section at the end
of this document.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>x</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A file with the &#39;x&#39; requests the use of direct access (dax)
mode, if the kernel supports DAX. This can be overridden by the
&#39;dax=never&#39; mount option. For more information see the kernel
documentation for dax:
&lt;<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/dax.html">https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/dax.html</a>&gt;.

If the attribute is set on an existing directory, it will be inherited
by all files and subdirectories that are subsequently created in the
directory. If an existing directory has contained some files and
subdirectories, modifying the attribute on the parent directory
doesn&#39;t change the attributes on these files and subdirectories.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>V</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A file with the &#39;V&#39; attribute set has fs-verity enabled. It
cannot be written to, and the file system will automatically verify
all data read from it against a cryptographic hash that covers the
entire file&#39;s contents, e.g. via a Merkle tree. This makes it possible
to efficiently authenticate the file. This attribute may not be set or
cleared using *chattr*(1), although it can be displayed by
*lsattr*(1).</dd>

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The &#39;c&#39;, &#39;s&#39;, and &#39;u&#39; attributes are not honored by the ext2, ext3, and
ext4 file systems as implemented in the current mainline Linux kernels.
Setting &#39;a&#39; and &#39;i&#39; attributes will not affect the ability to write to
already existing file descriptors.</p>
<p>
The &#39;j&#39; option is only useful for ext3 and ext4 file systems.</p>
<p>
The &#39;D&#39; option is only useful on Linux kernel 2.5.19 and later.</p>
