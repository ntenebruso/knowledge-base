DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems.
When run as first process on boot (as PID 1), it acts as init system
that brings up and maintains userspace services. Separate instances are
started for logged-in users to start their services.</p>
<p>
<strong>systemd</strong> is usually not invoked directly by the user, but is installed
as the /sbin/init symlink and started during early boot. The user
manager instances are started automatically through the
*user@.service*(5) service.</p>
<p>
For compatibility with SysV, if the binary is called as <strong>init</strong> and is
not the first process on the machine (PID is not 1), it will execute
<strong>telinit</strong> and pass all command line arguments unmodified. That means
<strong>init</strong> and <strong>telinit</strong> are mostly equivalent when invoked from normal
login sessions. See *telinit*(8) for more information.</p>
<p>
When run as a system instance, systemd interprets the configuration file
system.conf and the files in system.conf.d directories; when run as a
user instance, systemd interprets the configuration file user.conf and
the files in user.conf.d directories. See *systemd-system.conf*(5) for
more information.</p>
<p>
<strong>systemd</strong> contains native implementations of various tasks that need to
be executed as part of the boot process. For example, it sets the
hostname or configures the loopback network device. It also sets up and
mounts various API file systems, such as <em>sys</em>, <em>proc</em>, and <em>dev</em>.</p>
<p>
Note that some but not all interfaces provided by systemd are covered by
the <strong>Interface Portability and Stability Promise</strong>[1].</p>
<p>
The D-Bus API of <strong>systemd</strong> is described in *org.freedesktop.systemd1*(5)
and *org.freedesktop.LogControl1*(5).</p>
<p>
Systems which invoke systemd in a container or initrd environment should
implement the <strong>Container Interface</strong>[2] or <strong>initrd Interface</strong>[3]
specifications, respectively.</p>

UNITS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>systemd provides a dependency system between various entities called
&#34;units&#34; of 11 different types. Units encapsulate various objects that
are relevant for system boot-up and maintenance. The majority of units
are configured in unit configuration files, whose syntax and basic set
of options is described in *systemd.unit*(5), however some are created
automatically from other configuration files, dynamically from system
state or programmatically at runtime. Units may be &#34;active&#34; (meaning
started, bound, plugged in, …, depending on the unit type, see below),
or &#34;inactive&#34; (meaning stopped, unbound, unplugged, …), as well as in
the process of being activated or deactivated, i.e. between the two
states (these states are called &#34;activating&#34;, &#34;deactivating&#34;). A special
&#34;failed&#34; state is available as well, which is very similar to &#34;inactive&#34;
and is entered when the service failed in some way (process returned
error code on exit, or crashed, an operation timed out, or after too
many restarts). If this state is entered, the cause will be logged, for
later reference. Note that the various unit types may have a number of
additional substates, which are mapped to the five generalized unit
states described here.</p>
<p>
The following unit types are available:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Service units, which start and control daemons and the processes they
consist of. For details, see *systemd.service*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Socket units, which encapsulate local IPC or network sockets in the
system, useful for socket-based activation. For details about socket
units, see *systemd.socket*(5), for details on socket-based activation
and other forms of activation, see *daemon*(7).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Target units are useful to group units, or provide well-known
synchronization points during boot-up, see *systemd.target*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Device units expose kernel devices in systemd and may be used to
implement device-based activation. For details, see *systemd.device*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Mount units control mount points in the file system, for details see
*systemd.mount*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Automount units provide automount capabilities, for on-demand mounting
of file systems as well as parallelized boot-up. See
*systemd.automount*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Timer units are useful for triggering activation of other units based on
timers. You may find details in *systemd.timer*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Swap units are very similar to mount units and encapsulate memory swap
partitions or files of the operating system. They are described in
*systemd.swap*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Path units may be used to activate other services when file system
objects change or are modified. See *systemd.path*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Slice units may be used to group units which manage system processes
(such as service and scope units) in a hierarchical tree for resource
management purposes. See *systemd.slice*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Scope units are similar to service units, but manage foreign processes
instead of starting them as well. See *systemd.scope*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Units are named as their configuration files. Some units have special
semantics. A detailed list is available in *systemd.special*(7).</p>
<p>
systemd knows various kinds of dependencies, including positive and
negative requirement dependencies (i.e. <em>Requires=</em> and <em>Conflicts=</em>) as
well as ordering dependencies (<em>After=</em> and <em>Before=</em>). NB: ordering and
requirement dependencies are orthogonal. If only a requirement
dependency exists between two units (e.g. foo.service requires
bar.service), but no ordering dependency (e.g. foo.service after
bar.service) and both are requested to start, they will be started in
parallel. It is a common pattern that both requirement and ordering
dependencies are placed between two units. Also note that the majority
of dependencies are implicitly created and maintained by systemd. In
most cases, it should be unnecessary to declare additional dependencies
manually, however it is possible to do this.</p>
<p>
Application programs and units (via dependencies) may request state
changes of units. In systemd, these requests are encapsulated as jobs
and maintained in a job queue. Jobs may succeed or can fail, their
execution is ordered based on the ordering dependencies of the units
they have been scheduled for.</p>
<p>
On boot systemd activates the target unit default.target whose job is to
activate on-boot services and other on-boot units by pulling them in via
dependencies. Usually, the unit name is just an alias (symlink) for
either graphical.target (for fully-featured boots into the UI) or
multi-user.target (for limited console-only boots for use in embedded or
server environments, or similar; a subset of graphical.target). However,
it is at the discretion of the administrator to configure it as an alias
to any other target unit. See *systemd.special*(7) for details about
these target units.</p>
<p>
On first boot, <strong>systemd</strong> will enable or disable units according to
preset policy. See *systemd.preset*(5) and &#34;First Boot Semantics&#34; in
*machine-id*(5).</p>
<p>
systemd only keeps a minimal set of units loaded into memory.
Specifically, the only units that are kept loaded into memory are those
for which at least one of the following conditions is true:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It is in an active, activating, deactivating or failed state (i.e. in
any unit state except for &#34;inactive&#34;)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It has a job queued for it</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It is a dependency of at least one other unit that is loaded into memory</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It has some form of resource still allocated (e.g. a service unit that
is inactive but for which a process is still lingering that ignored the
request to be terminated)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It has been pinned into memory programmatically by a D-Bus call</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
systemd will automatically and implicitly load units from disk — if
they are not loaded yet — as soon as operations are requested for
them. Thus, in many respects, the fact whether a unit is loaded or not
is invisible to clients. Use <strong>systemctl list-units –all</strong> to
comprehensively list all units currently loaded. Any unit for which none
of the conditions above applies is promptly unloaded. Note that when a
unit is unloaded from memory its accounting data is flushed out too.
However, this data is generally not lost, as a journal log record is
generated declaring the consumed resources whenever a unit shuts down.</p>
<p>
Processes systemd spawns are placed in individual Linux control groups
named after the unit which they belong to in the private systemd
hierarchy. (see <strong>Control Groups v2</strong>[4] for more information about
control groups, or short &#34;cgroups&#34;). systemd uses this to effectively
keep track of processes. Control group information is maintained in the
kernel, and is accessible via the file system hierarchy (beneath
<em>sys/fs/cgroup</em>), or in tools such as <strong>systemd-cgls*(1) or *ps*(1) (*ps
xawf -eo pid,user,cgroup,args</strong> is particularly useful to list all
processes and the systemd units they belong to.).</p>
<p>
systemd is compatible with the SysV init system to a large degree: SysV
init scripts are supported and simply read as an alternative (though
limited) configuration file format. The SysV /dev/initctl interface is
provided, and compatibility implementations of the various SysV client
tools are available. In addition to that, various established Unix
functionality such as /etc/fstab or the utmp database are supported.</p>
<p>
systemd has a minimal transaction system: if a unit is requested to
start up or shut down it will add it and all its dependencies to a
temporary transaction. Then, it will verify if the transaction is
consistent (i.e. whether the ordering of all units is cycle-free). If it
is not, systemd will try to fix it up, and removes non-essential jobs
from the transaction that might remove the loop. Also, systemd tries to
suppress non-essential jobs in the transaction that would stop a running
service. Finally it is checked whether the jobs of the transaction
contradict jobs that have already been queued, and optionally the
transaction is aborted then. If all worked out and the transaction is
consistent and minimized in its impact it is merged with all already
outstanding jobs and added to the run queue. Effectively this means that
before executing a requested operation, systemd will verify that it
makes sense, fixing it if possible, and only failing if it really cannot
work.</p>
<p>
Note that transactions are generated independently of a units state at
runtime, hence, for example, if a start job is requested on an already
started unit, it will still generate a transaction and wake up any
inactive dependencies (and cause propagation of other jobs as per the
defined relationships). This is because the enqueued job is at the time
of execution compared to the target units state and is marked successful
and complete when both satisfy. However, this job also pulls in other
dependencies due to the defined relationships and thus leads to, in our
example, start jobs for any of those inactive units getting queued as
well.</p>
<p>
Units may be generated dynamically at boot and system manager reload
time, for example based on other configuration files or parameters
passed on the kernel command line. For details, see
*systemd.generator*(7).</p>

DIRECTORIES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>System unit directories</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The systemd system manager reads unit configuration from various
directories. Packages that want to install unit files shall place them
in the directory returned by <strong>pkg-config systemd
–variable=systemdsystemunitdir</strong>. Other directories checked are
/usr/local/lib/systemd/system and /usr/lib/systemd/system. User
configuration always takes precedence. <strong>pkg-config systemd
–variable=systemdsystemconfdir</strong> returns the path of the system
configuration directory. Packages should alter the content of these
directories only with the <strong>enable</strong> and <strong>disable</strong> commands of the
*systemctl*(1) tool. Full list of directories is provided in
*systemd.unit*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
User unit directories</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similar rules apply for the user unit directories. However, here the
<strong>XDG Base Directory specification</strong>[5] is followed to find units.
Applications should place their unit files in the directory returned by
<strong>pkg-config systemd –variable=systemduserunitdir</strong>. Global configuration
is done in the directory reported by <strong>pkg-config systemd
–variable=systemduserconfdir</strong>. The <strong>enable</strong> and <strong>disable</strong> commands of
the *systemctl*(1) tool can handle both global (i.e. for all users) and
private (for one user) enabling/disabling of units. Full list of
directories is provided in *systemd.unit*(5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
SysV init scripts directory</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The location of the SysV init script directory varies between
distributions. If systemd cannot find a native unit file for a requested
service, it will look for a SysV init script of the same name (with the
.service suffix removed).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
SysV runlevel link farm directory</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The location of the SysV runlevel link farm directory varies between
distributions. systemd will take the link farm into account when
figuring out whether a service shall be enabled. Note that a service
unit with a native unit configuration file cannot be started by
activating it in the SysV runlevel link farm.</p>

SIGNALS
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The service listens to various UNIX process signals that can be used to
request various actions asynchronously. The signal handling is enabled
very early during boot, before any further processes are invoked.
However, a supervising container manager or similar that intends to
request these operations via this mechanism must take into consideration
that this functionality is not available during the earliest
initialization phase. An <strong>sd_notify()</strong> notification message carrying the
<em>X_SYSTEMD_SIGNALS_LEVEL=2</em> field is emitted once the signal handlers
are enabled, see below. This may be used to schedule submission of these
signals correctly.</p>
<p>
<strong>SIGTERM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon receiving this signal the systemd system manager serializes its
state, reexecutes itself and deserializes the saved state again. This is
mostly equivalent to <strong>systemctl daemon-reexec</strong>.</p>
<p>
systemd user managers will start the exit.target unit when this signal
is received. This is mostly equivalent to <strong>systemctl –user start
exit.target –job-mode=replace-irreversibly</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>SIGINT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon receiving this signal the systemd system manager will start the
ctrl-alt-del.target unit. This is mostly equivalent to <strong>systemctl start
ctrl-alt-del.target –job-mode=replace-irreversibly</strong>. If this signal is
received more than 7 times per 2s, an immediate reboot is triggered.
Note that pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del on the console will trigger this signal.
Hence, if a reboot is hanging, pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del more than 7 times
in 2 seconds is a relatively safe way to trigger an immediate reboot.</p>
<p>
systemd user managers treat this signal the same way as <strong>SIGTERM</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>SIGWINCH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When this signal is received the systemd system manager will start the
kbrequest.target unit. This is mostly equivalent to <strong>systemctl start
kbrequest.target</strong>.</p>
<p>
This signal is ignored by systemd user managers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>SIGPWR</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When this signal is received the systemd manager will start the
sigpwr.target unit. This is mostly equivalent to <strong>systemctl start
sigpwr.target</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>SIGUSR1</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When this signal is received the systemd manager will try to reconnect
to the D-Bus bus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>SIGUSR2</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When this signal is received the systemd manager will log its complete
state in human-readable form. The data logged is the same as printed by
<strong>systemd-analyze dump</strong>.</p>

ENVIRONMENT
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The environment block for the system manager is initially set by the
kernel. (In particular, &#34;key=value&#34; assignments on the kernel command
line are turned into environment variables for PID 1). For the user
manager, the system manager sets the environment as described in the
&#34;Environment Variables in Spawned Processes&#34; section of
*systemd.exec*(5). The <em>DefaultEnvironment=</em> setting in the system
manager applies to all services including user@.service. Additional
entries may be configured (as for any other service) through the
<em>Environment=</em> and <em>EnvironmentFile=</em> settings for user@.service (see
*systemd.exec*(5)). Also, additional environment variables may be set
through the <em>ManagerEnvironment=</em> setting in *systemd-system.conf*(5)
and *systemd-user.conf*(5).</p>
<p>
Some of the variables understood by <strong>systemd</strong>:</p>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a higher log
level, i.e. less important ones, will be suppressed). Takes a
comma-separated list of values. A value may be either one of (in order
of decreasing importance) <strong>emerg</strong>, <strong>alert</strong>, <strong>crit</strong>, <strong>err</strong>, <strong>warning</strong>,
<strong>notice</strong>, <strong>info</strong>, <strong>debug</strong>, or an integer in the range 0…7. See
<strong>syslog*(3) for more information. Each value may optionally be prefixed
with one of *console</strong>, <strong>syslog</strong>, <strong>kmsg</strong> or <strong>journal</strong> followed by a colon
to set the maximum log level for that specific log target (e.g.
<strong>SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug,console:info</strong> specifies to log at debug level
except when logging to the console which should be at info level). Note
that the global maximum log level takes priority over any per target
maximum log levels.</p>
<p>
This can be overridden with <strong>–log-level=</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be colored
according to priority.</p>
<p>
This can be overridden with <strong>–log-color=</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed with a
timestamp.</p>

This can be overridden with <strong>–log-time=</strong>.</p>
<p>
Added in version 246.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION</em></p>

<p>A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename and line
number in the source code where the message originates.</p>
<p>
This can be overridden with <strong>–log-location=</strong>.</p>

<p>The destination for log messages. One of <strong>console</strong> (log to the attached
tty), <strong>console-prefixed</strong> (log to the attached tty but with prefixes
encoding the log level and &#34;facility&#34;, see <strong>syslog*(3), *kmsg</strong> (log to

This can be overridden with <strong>–log-target=</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LOG_RATELIMIT_KMSG</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether to ratelimit kmsg or not. Takes a boolean. Defaults to &#34;true&#34;.
If disabled, systemd will not ratelimit messages written to kmsg.</p>
<p>
Added in version 254.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</em>, <em>$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</em>, <em>$XDG_DATA_HOME</em>,
<em>$XDG_DATA_DIRS</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The systemd user manager uses these variables in accordance to the <strong>XDG
Base Directory specification</strong>[5] to find its configuration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_UNIT_PATH</em>, <em>$SYSTEMD_GENERATOR_PATH</em>,
<em>$SYSTEMD_ENVIRONMENT_GENERATOR_PATH</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Controls where systemd looks for unit files and generators.</p>
<p>
These variables may contain a list of paths, separated by colons (&#34;:&#34;).
When set, if the list ends with an empty component (&#34;…:&#34;), this list
is prepended to the usual set of paths. Otherwise, the specified list
replaces the usual set of paths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pager to use when <strong>–no-pager</strong> is not given; overrides <em>$PAGER</em>. If
neither <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</em> nor <em>$PAGER</em> are set, a set of well-known pager
implementations are tried in turn, including *less*(1) and *more*(1),
until one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is
invoked. Setting this environment variable to an empty string or the
value &#34;cat&#34; is equivalent to passing <strong>–no-pager</strong>.</p>
<p>
Note: if <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em> is not set, <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</em> (as well as
<em>$PAGER</em>) will be silently ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LESS</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Override the options passed to <strong>less</strong> (by default &#34;FRSXMK&#34;).</p>
<p>
Users might want to change two options in particular:</p>
<p>
<strong>K</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when Ctrl+C is
pressed. To allow <strong>less</strong> to handle Ctrl+C itself to switch back to the
pager command prompt, unset this option.</p>
<p>
If the value of <em>$SYSTEMD_LESS</em> does not include &#34;K&#34;, and the pager that
is invoked is <strong>less</strong>, Ctrl+C will be ignored by the executable, and
needs to be handled by the pager.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>X</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option instructs the pager to not send termcap initialization and
deinitialization strings to the terminal. It is set by default to allow
command output to remain visible in the terminal even after the pager
exits. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager functionality from
working, in particular paged output cannot be scrolled with the mouse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that setting the regular <em>$LESS</em> environment variable has no effect
for <strong>less</strong> invocations by systemd tools.</p>
<p>
See *less*(1) for more discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Override the charset passed to <strong>less</strong> (by default &#34;utf-8&#34;, if the
invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).</p>
<p>
Note that setting the regular <em>$LESSCHARSET</em> environment variable has no
effect for <strong>less</strong> invocations by systemd tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument. When true, the &#34;secure&#34; mode of the pager is
enabled; if false, disabled. If <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em> is not set at
all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the
owner of the login session, see <strong>geteuid*(2) and
*sd_pid_get_owner_uid*(3). In secure mode, *LESSSECURE=1</strong> will be set
when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open
or create new files or start new subprocesses. When
<em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em> is not set at all, pagers which are not known to
implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only *less*(1)
implements secure mode.)</p>
<p>
Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for example
under *sudo*(8) or *pkexec*(1), care must be taken to ensure that
unintended interactive features are not enabled. &#34;Secure&#34; mode for the
pager may be enabled automatically as describe above. Setting
<em>SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0</em> or not removing it from the inherited
environment allows the user to invoke arbitrary commands. Note that if
the <em>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</em> or <em>$PAGER</em> variables are to be honoured,
<em>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</em> must be set too. It might be reasonable to
completely disable the pager using <strong>–no-pager</strong> instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_COLORS</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument. When true, <strong>systemd</strong> and related utilities
will use colors in their output, otherwise the output will be
monochrome. Additionally, the variable can take one of the following
special values: &#34;16&#34;, &#34;256&#34; to restrict the use of colors to the base 16
or 256 ANSI colors, respectively. This can be specified to override the
automatic decision based on <em>$TERM</em> and what the console is connected
to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$SYSTEMD_URLIFY</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should be
generated in the output for terminal emulators supporting this. This can
be specified to override the decision that <strong>systemd</strong> makes based on
<em>$TERM</em> and other conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$LISTEN_PID</em>, <em>$LISTEN_FDS</em>, <em>$LISTEN_FDNAMES</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set by systemd for supervised processes during socket-based activation.
See *sd_listen_fds*(3) for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>$NOTIFY_SOCKET</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set by service manager for its services for status and readiness
notifications. Also consumed by service manager for notifying
supervising container managers or service managers up the stack about
its own progress. See *sd_notify*(3) and the relevant section below for
more information.</p>

KERNEL COMMAND LINE
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>When run as the system instance, systemd parses a number of options
listed below. They can be specified as kernel command line arguments
which are parsed from a number of sources depending on the environment
in which systemd is executed. If run inside a Linux container, these
options are parsed from the command line arguments passed to systemd
itself, next to any of the command line options listed in the Options
section above. If run outside of Linux containers, these arguments are
parsed from /proc/cmdline and from the &#34;SystemdOptions&#34; EFI variable (on
EFI systems) instead. Options from /proc/cmdline have higher priority.</p>
<p>
Note: use of &#34;SystemdOptions&#34; is deprecated.</p>
<p>
The following variables are understood:</p>
<p>
<em>systemd.unit=</em>, <em>rd.systemd.unit=</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overrides the unit to activate on boot. Defaults to default.target. This
may be used to temporarily boot into a different boot unit, for example
rescue.target or emergency.service. See *systemd.special*(7) for details

<em>systemd.dump_core</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument or enables the option if specified without an
argument. If enabled, the systemd manager (PID 1) dumps core when it
crashes. Otherwise, no core dump is created. Defaults to enabled.</p>
<p>
Added in version 233.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>systemd.crash_chvt</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a positive integer, or a boolean argument. Can be also specified
without an argument, with the same effect as a positive boolean. If a
positive integer (in the range 1–63) is specified, the system manager
(PID 1) will activate the specified virtual terminal when it crashes.
Defaults to disabled, meaning that no such switch is attempted. If set
to enabled, the virtual terminal the kernel messages are written to is
used instead.</p>
<p>
Added in version 233.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>systemd.crash_shell</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument or enables the option if specified without an
argument. If enabled, the system manager (PID 1) spawns a shell when it
crashes, after a 10s delay. Otherwise, no shell is spawned. Defaults to
disabled, for security reasons, as the shell is not protected by
password authentication.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Takes one of &#34;freeze&#34;, &#34;reboot&#34; or &#34;poweroff&#34;. Defaults to &#34;freeze&#34;. If
set to &#34;freeze&#34;, the system will hang indefinitely when the system
manager (PID 1) crashes. If set to &#34;reboot&#34;, the system manager (PID 1)
will reboot the machine automatically when it crashes, after a 10s
delay. If set to &#34;poweroff&#34;, the system manager (PID 1) will power off
the machine immediately when it crashes. If combined with
<em>systemd.crash_shell</em>, the configured crash action is executed after the
shell exits.</p>

<p>
<em>systemd.confirm_spawn</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument or a path to the virtual console where the
confirmation messages should be emitted. Can be also specified without
an argument, with the same effect as a positive boolean. If enabled, the
system manager (PID 1) asks for confirmation when spawning processes
using <strong>/dev/console</strong>. If a path or a console name (such as &#34;ttyS0&#34;) is
provided, the virtual console pointed to by this path or described by

<p>
<em>systemd.show_status</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Takes a boolean argument or the constants <strong>error</strong> and <strong>auto</strong>. Can be
also specified without an argument, with the same effect as a positive
boolean. If enabled, the systemd manager (PID 1) shows terse service
status updates on the console during bootup. With <strong>error</strong>, only messages
about failures are shown, but boot is otherwise quiet. <strong>auto</strong> behaves
like <strong>false</strong> until there is a significant delay in boot. Defaults to
enabled, unless <strong>quiet</strong> is passed as kernel command line option, in
which case it defaults to <strong>error</strong>. If specified overrides the system
manager configuration file option <strong>ShowStatus=</strong>, see

READINESS PROTOCOL
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The service manager implements a readiness notification protocol both
between the manager and its services (i.e. down the stack), and between
the manager and a potential supervisor further up the stack (the latter
could be a machine or container manager, or in case of a per-user
service manager the system service manager instance). The basic protocol
(and the suggested API for it) is described in *sd_notify*(3).</p>
<p>
The notification socket the service manager (including PID 1) uses for
reporting readiness to its own supervisor is set via the usual
<em>$NOTIFY_SOCKET</em> environment variable (see above). Since this is
directly settable only for container managers and for the per-user
instance of the service manager, an additional mechanism to configure
this is available, in particular intended for use in VM environments:
the <em>vmm.notify_socket</em> system credential (see above) may be set to a
suitable socket (typically an <strong>AF_VSOCK</strong> one) via SMBIOS Type 11 vendor
strings. For details see above.</p>
<p>
The notification protocol from the service manager up the stack towards
a supervisor supports a number of extension fields that allow a
supervisor to learn about specific properties of the system and track
its boot progress. Specifically the following fields are sent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
An <em>X_SYSTEMD_HOSTNAME=…</em> message will be sent out once the initial
hostname for the system has been determined. Note that during later
runtime the hostname might be changed again programmatically, and
(currently) no further notifications are sent out in that case.</p>
<p>
Added in version 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
An <em>X_SYSTEMD_MACHINE_ID=…</em> message will be sent out once the machine
ID of the system has been determined. See *machine-id*(5) for details.</p>
<p>
Added in version 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
An <em>X_SYSTEMD_SIGNALS_LEVEL=…</em> message will be sent out once the
service manager installed the various UNIX process signal handlers
described above. The fields value is an unsigned integer formatted as
decimal string, and indicates the supported UNIX process signal feature
level of the service manager. Currently, only a single feature level is
defined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>X_SYSTEMD_SIGNALS_LEVEL=2</em> covers the various UNIX process signals
documented above – which are a superset of those supported by the
historical SysV init system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Signals sent to PID 1 before this message is sent might not be handled
correctly yet. A consumer of these messages should parse the value as an
unsigned integer indication the level of support. For now only the
mentioned level 2 is defined, but later on additional levels might be
defined with higher integers, that will implement a superset of the
currently defined behaviour.</p>
<p>
Added in version 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
<em>X_SYSTEMD_UNIT_ACTIVE=…</em> and <em>X_SYSTEMD_UNIT_INACTIVE=…</em> messages
will be sent out for each target unit as it becomes active or stops
being active. This is useful to track boot progress and functionality.
For example, once the ssh-access.target unit is reported started SSH
access is typically available, see *systemd.special*(7) for details.</p>
<p>
Added in version 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
An <em>X_SYSTEMD_SHUTDOWN=…</em> message will be sent out very shortly before
the system shuts down. The value is one of the strings &#34;reboot&#34;, &#34;halt&#34;,
&#34;poweroff&#34;, &#34;kexec&#34; and indicates which kind of shutdown is being
executed.</p>
<p>
Added in version 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>·</p>
<p>
An <em>X_SYSTEMD_REBOOT_PARAMETER=…</em> message will also be sent out very
shortly before the system shuts down. Its value is the reboot argument
as configured with <strong>systemctl –reboot-argument=…</strong>.</p>

enqueued at start-up), dump it and exit — without actually executing
any of the determined jobs. This option is useful for debugging only.
Note that during regular service manager start-up additional units not
shown by this operation may be started, because hardware, socket, bus or
other kinds of activation might add additional jobs as the transaction
is executed. Use <strong>–system</strong> to request the initial transaction of the
system service manager (this is also the implied default), combine with
<strong>–user</strong> to request the initial transaction of the per-user service
manager instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–system</strong>, <strong>–user</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When used in conjunction with <strong>–test</strong>, selects whether to calculate the
initial transaction for the system instance or for a per-user instance.
These options have no effect when invoked without <strong>–test</strong>, as during
regular (i.e. non-<strong>–test</strong>) invocations the service manager will
automatically detect whether it shall operate in system or per-user
mode, by checking whether the PID it is run as is 1 or not. Note that it
is not supported booting and maintaining a system with the service
manager running in <strong>–system</strong> mode but with a PID other than 1.</p>

Options that duplicate kernel command line settings
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Those options correspond directly to options listed above in &#34;Kernel
Command Line&#34;. Both forms may be used equivalently for the system
manager, but it is recommended to use the forms listed above in this
context, because they are properly namespaced. When an option is
specified both on the kernel command line and as a normal command line
argument, the latter has higher precedence.</p>
<p>
When <strong>systemd</strong> is used as a user manager, the kernel command line is
ignored and only the options described below are understood.
Nevertheless, <strong>systemd</strong> is usually started in this mode through the
*user@.service*(5) service, which is shared between all users. It may be
more convenient to use configuration files to modify settings (see
*systemd-user.conf*(5)), or environment variables. See the &#34;Environment&#34;
section above for a discussion of how the environment block is set.</p>
<p>
<strong>–unit=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set default unit to activate on startup. If not specified, defaults to
default.target. See <em>systemd.unit=</em> above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–dump-core</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable core dumping on crash. This switch has no effect when running as
user instance. Same as <em>systemd.dump_core=</em> above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*–crash-vt=*/VT/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Switch to a specific virtual console (VT) on crash. This switch has no
effect when running as user instance. Same as <em>systemd.crash_chvt=</em>
above (but not the different spelling!).</p>
<p>
Added in version 227.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–crash-shell</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run a shell on crash. This switch has no effect when running as user
instance. See <em>systemd.crash_shell=</em> above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–crash-action=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specify what to do when the system manager (PID 1) crashes. This switch
has no effect when systemd is running as user instance. See
<em>systemd.crash_action=</em> above.</p>
<p>
Added in version 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–confirm-spawn</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ask for confirmation when spawning processes. This switch has no effect
when run as user instance. See <em>systemd.confirm_spawn</em> above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Set log target. See <em>systemd.log_target</em> above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–log-time=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prefix console messages with timestamp. See <em>systemd.log_time</em> above.</p>
<p>
Added in version 246.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–machine-id=</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Override the machine-id set on the hard drive. See <em>systemd.machine_id=</em>
above.</p>
<p>
Added in version 229.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>–service-watchdogs</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Globally enable/disable all service watchdog timeouts and emergency
actions. See <em>systemd.service_watchdogs</em> above.</p>
