DESCRIPTION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) usable as an interactive login
shell and as a shell script command processor. Of the standard shells,
zsh most closely resembles <strong>ksh</strong> but includes many enhancements. It does
not provide compatibility with POSIX or other shells in its default
operating mode: see the section `Compatibility&#39; below.</p>
<p>
Zsh has command line editing, builtin spelling correction, programmable
command completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a history
mechanism, and a host of other features.</p>

word `hierographic&#39; does not exist). It can be viewed in its current
state at <strong><a href="https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Guide/">https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Guide/</a></strong>. At the time of writing,
chapters dealing with startup files and their contents and the new

INVOCATION
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The following flags are interpreted by the shell when invoked to
determine where the shell will read commands from:</p>
<p>
<strong>-c</strong> Take the first argument as a command to execute, rather than
reading commands from a script or standard input. If any further
arguments are given, the first one is assigned to <strong>$0</strong>, rather than
being used as a positional parameter.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>-i</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Force shell to be interactive. It is still possible to specify
a script to execute.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>-s</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Force shell to read commands from the standard input. If the
<strong>-s</strong> flag is not present and an argument is given, the first argument
is taken to be the pathname of a script to execute.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If there are any remaining arguments after option processing, and
neither of the options <strong>-c</strong> or <strong>-s</strong> was supplied, the first argument is
taken as the file name of a script containing shell commands to be
executed. If the option <strong>PATH_SCRIPT</strong> is set, and the file name does not
contain a directory path (i.e. there is no `*/*&#39; in the name), first the
current directory and then the command path given by the variable <strong>PATH</strong>
are searched for the script. If the option is not set or the file name
contains a `*/*&#39; it is used directly.</p>
<p>
After the first one or two arguments have been appropriated as described
above, the remaining arguments are assigned to the positional
parameters.</p>
<p>
For further options, which are common to invocation and the <strong>set</strong>
builtin, see /zshoptions/(1).</p>
<p>
The long option `*–emulate*&#39; followed (in a separate word) by an
emulation mode may be passed to the shell. The emulation modes are those
described for the <strong>emulate</strong> builtin, see /zshbuiltins/(1). The
`*–emulate*&#39; option must precede any other options (which might
otherwise be overridden), but following options are honoured, so may be
used to modify the requested emulation mode. Note that certain extra
steps are taken to ensure a smooth emulation when this option is used
compared with the <strong>emulate</strong> command within the shell: for example,
variables that conflict with POSIX usage such as <strong>path</strong> are not defined
within the shell.</p>
<p>
Options may be specified by name using the <strong>-o</strong> option. <strong>-o</strong> acts like a
single-letter option, but takes a following string as the option name.
For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
zsh -x -o shwordsplit scr
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
runs the script <strong>scr</strong>, setting the <strong>XTRACE</strong> option by the corresponding
letter `*-x*&#39; and the <strong>SH_WORD_SPLIT</strong> option by name. Options may be
turned <em>off</em> by name by using <strong>+o</strong> instead of <strong>-o</strong>. <strong>-o</strong> can be stacked
up with preceding single-letter options, so for example `*-xo
shwordsplit*&#39; or `*-xoshwordsplit*&#39; is equivalent to `*-x -o
shwordsplit*&#39;.</p>
<p>
Options may also be specified by name in GNU long option style,
`*–<strong><em>option-name</em>&#39;. When this is done, `</strong>-<strong>&#39; characters in the option
name are permitted: they are translated into `*_</strong>&#39;, and thus ignored.
So, for example, `*zsh –sh-word-split*&#39; invokes zsh with the
<strong>SH_WORD_SPLIT</strong> option turned on. Like other option syntaxes, options
can be turned off by replacing the initial `*-<strong>&#39; with a `*+</strong>&#39;; thus
`*+-sh-word-split*&#39; is equivalent to `*–no-sh-word-split*&#39;. Unlike
other option syntaxes, GNU-style long options cannot be stacked with any
other options, so for example `*-x-shwordsplit*&#39; is an error, rather
than being treated like `*-x –shwordsplit*&#39;.</p>
<p>
The special GNU-style option `*–version*&#39; is handled; it sends to
standard output the shell&#39;s version information, then exits
successfully. `*–help*&#39; is also handled; it sends to standard output a
list of options that can be used when invoking the shell, then exits
successfully.</p>
<p>
Option processing may be finished, allowing following arguments that
start with `*-<strong>&#39; or `*+</strong>&#39; to be treated as normal arguments, in two
ways. Firstly, a lone `*-<strong>&#39; (or `*+</strong>&#39;) as an argument by itself ends
option processing. Secondly, a special option `*–<strong>&#39; (or `*+-</strong>&#39;), which
may be specified on its own (which is the standard POSIX usage) or may
be stacked with preceding options (so `*-x-<strong>&#39; is equivalent to
`</strong>-x –<strong>&#39;). Options are not permitted to be stacked after `</strong>–<strong>&#39; (so
`</strong>-x-f*&#39; is an error), but note the GNU-style option form discussed
above, where `*–shwordsplit*&#39; is permitted and does not end option
processing.</p>
<p>
Except when the <strong>sh*/*ksh</strong> emulation single-letter options are in
effect, the option `*-b*&#39; (or `*+b*&#39;) ends option processing. `*-b*&#39; is
like `*–<strong>&#39;, except that further single-letter options can be stacked
after the `</strong>-b*&#39; and will take effect as normal.</p>

COMPATIBILITY
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Zsh tries to emulate <strong>sh</strong> or <strong>ksh</strong> when it is invoked as <strong>sh</strong> or <strong>ksh</strong>
respectively; more precisely, it looks at the first letter of the name
by which it was invoked, excluding any initial `*r*&#39; (assumed to stand
for `restricted&#39;), and if that is `*b*&#39;, `*s*&#39; or `*k*&#39; it will emulate
<strong>sh</strong> or <strong>ksh</strong>. Furthermore, if invoked as <strong>su</strong> (which happens on certain
systems when the shell is executed by the <strong>su</strong> command), the shell will
try to find an alternative name from the <strong>SHELL</strong> environment variable
and perform emulation based on that.</p>
<p>
In <strong>sh</strong> and <strong>ksh</strong> compatibility modes the following parameters are not
special and not initialized by the shell: <strong>ARGC</strong>, <strong>argv</strong>, <strong>cdpath</strong>,
<strong>fignore</strong>, <strong>fpath</strong>, <strong>HISTCHARS</strong>, <strong>mailpath</strong>, <strong>MANPATH</strong>, <strong>manpath</strong>,
<strong>path</strong>, <strong>prompt</strong>, <strong>PROMPT</strong>, <strong>PROMPT2</strong>, <strong>PROMPT3</strong>, <strong>PROMPT4</strong>, <strong>psvar</strong>,
<strong>status</strong>.</p>
<p>
The usual zsh startup/shutdown scripts are not executed. Login shells
source <strong>/etc/profile</strong> followed by <strong>$HOME/.profile</strong>. If the <strong>ENV</strong>
environment variable is set on invocation, <strong>$ENV</strong> is sourced after the
profile scripts. The value of <strong>ENV</strong> is subjected to parameter expansion,
command substitution, and arithmetic expansion before being interpreted
as a pathname. Note that the <strong>PRIVILEGED</strong> option also affects the
execution of startup files.</p>
<p>
The following options are set if the shell is invoked as <strong>sh</strong> or <strong>ksh</strong>:
<strong>NO_BAD_PATTERN</strong>, <strong>NO_BANG_HIST</strong>, <strong>NO_BG_NICE</strong>, <strong>NO_EQUALS</strong>,
<strong>NO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO</strong>, <strong>GLOB_SUBST</strong>, <strong>NO_GLOBAL_EXPORT</strong>, <strong>NO_HUP</strong>,
<strong>INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS</strong>, <strong>KSH_ARRAYS</strong>, <strong>NO_MULTIOS</strong>, <strong>NO_NOMATCH</strong>,
<strong>NO_NOTIFY</strong>, <strong>POSIX_BUILTINS</strong>, <strong>NO_PROMPT_PERCENT</strong>, <strong>RM_STAR_SILENT</strong>,
<strong>SH_FILE_EXPANSION</strong>, <strong>SH_GLOB</strong>, <strong>SH_OPTION_LETTERS</strong>, <strong>SH_WORD_SPLIT</strong>.
Additionally the <strong>BSD_ECHO</strong> and <strong>IGNORE_BRACES</strong> options are set if zsh
is invoked as <strong>sh</strong>. Also, the <strong>KSH_OPTION_PRINT</strong>, <strong>LOCAL_OPTIONS</strong>,
<strong>PROMPT_BANG</strong>, <strong>PROMPT_SUBST</strong> and <strong>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</strong> options are set if
zsh is invoked as <strong>ksh</strong>.</p>
<p>
Please note that, whilst reasonable efforts are taken to address
incompatibilities when they arise, zsh does not guarantee complete
emulation of other shells, nor POSIX compliance. For more information on
the differences between zsh and other shells, please refer to chapter 2
of the shell FAQ, <strong><a href="https://www.zsh.org/FAQ/">https://www.zsh.org/FAQ/</a></strong>.</p>

RESTRICTED SHELL
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-2">

letter `*r*&#39; or the `*-r*&#39; command line option is supplied at
invocation, the shell becomes restricted. Emulation mode is determined

RESTRICTED</dd>
</dl>
<p>These restrictions are enforced after processing the startup files. The
startup files should set up <strong>PATH</strong> to point to a directory of commands
which can be safely invoked in the restricted environment. They may also
add further restrictions by disabling selected builtins.</p>
<p>
Restricted mode can also be activated any time by setting the
<strong>RESTRICTED</strong> option. This immediately enables all the restrictions
described above even if the shell still has not processed all startup
files.</p>
<p>
A shell <em>Restricted Mode</em> is an outdated way to restrict what users may
do: modern systems have better, safer and more reliable ways to confine
user actions, such as <em>chroot jails</em>, <em>containers</em> and <em>zones</em>.</p>
<p>
A restricted shell is very difficult to implement safely. The feature
may be removed in a future version of zsh.</p>
<p>
It is important to realise that the restrictions only apply to the
shell, not to the commands it runs (except for some shell builtins).
While a restricted shell can only run the restricted list of commands
accessible via the predefined `*PATH*&#39; variable, it does not prevent
those commands from running any other command.</p>
<p>
As an example, if `*env*&#39; is among the list of <em>allowed</em> commands, then
it allows the user to run any command as `*env*&#39; is not a shell builtin
command and can run arbitrary executables.</p>
<p>
So when implementing a restricted shell framework it is important to be
fully aware of what actions each of the <em>allowed</em> commands or features
(which may be regarded as <em>modules</em>) can perform.</p>
<p>
Many commands can have their behaviour affected by environment
variables. Except for the few listed above, zsh does not restrict the
setting of environment variables.</p>
<p>
If a `*perl*&#39;, `*python*&#39;, `*bash*&#39;, or other general purpose
interpreted script it treated as a restricted command, the user can work
around the restriction by setting specially crafted `*PERL5LIB*&#39;,
`*PYTHONPATH*&#39;, `*BASHENV*&#39; (etc.) environment variables. On GNU
systems, any command can be made to run arbitrary code when performing
character set conversion (including zsh itself) by setting a
`*GCONV_PATH*&#39; environment variable. Those are only a few examples.</p>
<p>
Bear in mind that, contrary to some other shells, `*readonly*&#39; is not a
security feature in zsh as it can be undone and so cannot be used to
mitigate the above.</p>
<p>
A restricted shell only works if the allowed commands are few and
carefully written so as not to grant more access to users than intended.
It is also important to restrict what zsh module the user may load as
some of them, such as `*zsh/system*&#39;, `*zsh/mapfile*&#39; and `*zsh/files*&#39;,
allow bypassing most of the restrictions.</p>

STARTUP/SHUTDOWN FILES
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Commands are first read from <strong>/etc/zshenv</strong>; this cannot be overridden.
Subsequent behaviour is modified by the <strong>RCS</strong> and <strong>GLOBAL_RCS</strong> options;
the former affects all startup files, while the second only affects
global startup files (those shown here with an path starting with a
<strong>/</strong>). If one of the options is unset at any point, any subsequent
startup file(s) of the corresponding type will not be read. It is also
possible for a file in <strong>$ZDOTDIR</strong> to re-enable <strong>GLOBAL_RCS</strong>. Both <strong>RCS</strong>
and <strong>GLOBAL_RCS</strong> are set by default.</p>
<p>
Commands are then read from <strong>$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv</strong>. If the shell is a login
shell, commands are read from <strong>/etc/zprofile</strong> and then
<strong>$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile</strong>. Then, if the shell is interactive, commands are
read from <strong>/etc/zshrc</strong> and then <strong>$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc</strong>. Finally, if the shell
is a login shell, <strong>/etc/zlogin</strong> and <strong>$ZDOTDIR/.zlogin</strong> are read.</p>
<p>
When a login shell exits, the files <strong>$ZDOTDIR/.zlogout</strong> and then
<strong>/etc/zlogout</strong> are read. This happens with either an explicit exit via
the <strong>exit</strong> or <strong>logout</strong> commands, or an implicit exit by reading
end-of-file from the terminal. However, if the shell terminates due to
<strong>exec</strong>&#39;ing another process, the logout files are not read. These are
also affected by the <strong>RCS</strong> and <strong>GLOBAL_RCS</strong> options. Note also that the
<strong>RCS</strong> option affects the saving of history files, i.e. if <strong>RCS</strong> is unset
when the shell exits, no history file will be saved.</p>
<p>
If <strong>ZDOTDIR</strong> is unset, <strong>HOME</strong> is used instead. Files listed above as
being in <strong>/etc</strong> may be in another directory, depending on the
installation.</p>
<p>
As <strong>/etc/zshenv</strong> is run for all instances of zsh, it is important that
it be kept as small as possible. In particular, it is a good idea to put
code that does not need to be run for every single shell behind a test
of the form `*if <a href=" -o rcs "> -o rcs </a>; then …*&#39; so that it will not be
executed when zsh is invoked with the `*-f*&#39; option.</p>
<p>
Any of these files may be pre-compiled with the <strong>zcompile</strong> builtin
command (see /zshbuiltins/(1)). If a compiled file exists (named for the
original file plus the <strong>.zwc</strong> extension) and it is newer than the
original file, the compiled file will be used instead.</p>
