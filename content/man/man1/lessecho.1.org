#+TITLE: Manpages - lessecho.1
* NAME
lessecho - expand metacharacters

* SYNOPSIS
*lessecho* /[-ox] [-cx] [-pn] [-dn] [-mx] [-nn] [-ex] [-a] file .../

* DESCRIPTION
*lessecho* is a program that simply echos its arguments on standard
output. But any metacharacter in the output is preceded by an "escape"
character, which by default is a backslash. *lessecho* is invoked
internally by *less*, and is not intended to be used directly by humans.

* OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.

- *-e/x/* :: Specifies "/x/", rather than backslash, to be the escape
  char for metachars. If /x/ is "-", no escape char is used and
  arguments containing metachars are surrounded by quotes instead.

- *-o/x/* :: Specifies "/x/", rather than double-quote, to be the open
  quote character, which is used if the -e- option is specified.

- *-c/x/* :: Specifies "/x/" to be the close quote character.

- *-p/n/* :: Specifies "/n/" to be the open quote character, as an
  integer.

- *-d/n/* :: Specifies "/n/" to be the close quote character, as an
  integer.

- *-m/x/* :: Specifies "/x/" to be a metachar. By default, no characters
  are considered metachars.

- *-n/n/* :: Specifies "/n/" to be a metachar, as an integer.

- *-f/n/* :: Specifies "/n/" to be the escape char for metachars, as an
  integer.

- *-a* :: Specifies that all arguments are to be quoted. The default is
  that only arguments containing metacharacters are quoted.
