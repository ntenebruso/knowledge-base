* Name
=nix store repair= - repair store paths

* Synopsis
=nix store repair= [/option/...] /installables/...

* Examples
- Repair a store path, after determining that it is corrupt:

#+begin_example
# nix store verify /nix/store/yb5q57zxv6hgqql42d5r8b5k5mcq6kay-hello-2.10
path '/nix/store/yb5q57zxv6hgqql42d5r8b5k5mcq6kay-hello-2.10' was
modified! expected hash
'sha256:1hd5vnh6xjk388gdk841vflicy8qv7qzj2hb7xlyh8lpb43j921l', got
'sha256:1a25lf78x5wi6pfkrxalf0n13kdaca0bqmjqnp7wfjza2qz5ssgl'

# nix store repair /nix/store/yb5q57zxv6hgqql42d5r8b5k5mcq6kay-hello-2.10
#+end_example

* Description
This command attempts to “repair” the store paths specified by
/installables/ by redownloading them using the available substituters.
If no substitutes are available, then repair is not possible.

#+begin_quote
*Warning*

During repair, there is a very small time window during which the old
path (if it exists) is moved out of the way and replaced with the new
path. If repair is interrupted in between, then the system may be left
in a broken state (e.g., if the path contains a critical system
component like the GNU C Library).

#+end_quote

* Options
- =--stdin=

  Read installables from the standard input. No default installable
  applied.

** Common evaluation options
- =--arg= /name/ /expr/

  Pass the value /expr/ as the argument /name/ to Nix functions.

- =--arg-from-file= /name/ /path/

  Pass the contents of file /path/ as the argument /name/ to Nix
  functions.

- =--arg-from-stdin= /name/

  Pass the contents of stdin as the argument /name/ to Nix functions.

- =--argstr= /name/ /string/

  Pass the string /string/ as the argument /name/ to Nix functions.

- =--debugger=

  Start an interactive environment if evaluation fails.

- =--eval-store= /store-url/

  The *URL of the Nix store* to use for evaluation, i.e. to store
  derivations (=.drv= files) and inputs referenced by them.

- =--impure=

  Allow access to mutable paths and repositories.

- =--include= / =-I= /path/

  Add /path/ to search path entries used to resolve *lookup paths*

  This option may be given multiple times.

  Paths added through =-I= take precedence over the =nix-path=
  configuration setting and the =NIX_PATH= environment variable.

- =--override-flake= /original-ref/ /resolved-ref/

  Override the flake registries, redirecting /original-ref/ to
  /resolved-ref/.

** Common flake-related options
- =--commit-lock-file=

  Commit changes to the flake's lock file.

- =--inputs-from= /flake-url/

  Use the inputs of the specified flake as registry entries.

- =--no-registries=

  Don't allow lookups in the flake registries.

  #+begin_quote
  *DEPRECATED*

  #+end_quote

  #+begin_quote
  Use =--no-use-registries= instead.

  #+end_quote

- =--no-update-lock-file=

  Do not allow any updates to the flake's lock file.

- =--no-write-lock-file=

  Do not write the flake's newly generated lock file.

- =--output-lock-file= /flake-lock-path/

  Write the given lock file instead of =flake.lock= within the top-level
  flake.

- =--override-input= /input-path/ /flake-url/

  Override a specific flake input (e.g. =dwarffs/nixpkgs=). This implies
  =--no-write-lock-file=.

- =--recreate-lock-file=

  Recreate the flake's lock file from scratch.

  #+begin_quote
  *DEPRECATED*

  #+end_quote

  #+begin_quote
  Use =nix flake update= instead.

  #+end_quote

- =--reference-lock-file= /flake-lock-path/

  Read the given lock file instead of =flake.lock= within the top-level
  flake.

- =--update-input= /input-path/

  Update a specific flake input (ignoring its previous entry in the lock
  file).

  #+begin_quote
  *DEPRECATED*

  #+end_quote

  #+begin_quote
  Use =nix flake update= instead.

  #+end_quote

** Logging-related options
- =--debug=

  Set the logging verbosity level to ‘debug'.

- =--log-format= /format/

  Set the format of log output; one of =raw=, =internal-json=, =bar= or
  =bar-with-logs=.

- =--print-build-logs= / =-L=

  Print full build logs on standard error.

- =--quiet=

  Decrease the logging verbosity level.

- =--verbose= / =-v=

  Increase the logging verbosity level.

** Miscellaneous global options
- =--help=

  Show usage information.

- =--offline=

  Disable substituters and consider all previously downloaded files
  up-to-date.

- =--option= /name/ /value/

  Set the Nix configuration setting /name/ to /value/ (overriding
  =nix.conf=).

- =--refresh=

  Consider all previously downloaded files out-of-date.

- =--repair=

  During evaluation, rewrite missing or corrupted files in the Nix
  store. During building, rebuild missing or corrupted store paths.

- =--version=

  Show version information.

** Options that change the interpretation of *installables*
- =--all=

  Apply the operation to every store path.

- =--derivation=

  Operate on the *store derivation* rather than its outputs.

- =--expr= /expr/

  Interpret /installables/ as attribute paths relative to the Nix
  expression /expr/.

- =--file= / =-f= /file/

  Interpret /installables/ as attribute paths relative to the Nix
  expression stored in /file/. If /file/ is the character -, then a Nix
  expression will be read from standard input. Implies =--impure=.

- =--recursive= / =-r=

  Apply operation to closure of the specified paths.

  *Note*

  See =man nix.conf= for overriding configuration settings with command
  line flags.
