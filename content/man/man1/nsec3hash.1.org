#+TITLE: Manpages - nsec3hash.1
* NAME
nsec3hash - generate NSEC3 hash

* SYNOPSIS
*nsec3hash* {salt} {algorithm} {iterations} {domain}

*nsec3hash* *-r* {algorithm} {flags} {iterations} {salt} {domain}

* DESCRIPTION
*nsec3hash* generates an NSEC3 hash based on a set of NSEC3 parameters.
This can be used to check the validity of NSEC3 records in a signed
zone.

If this command is invoked as *nsec3hash -r*, it takes arguments in
order, matching the first four fields of an NSEC3 record followed by the
domain name: *algorithm*, *flags*, *iterations*, *salt*, *domain*. This
makes it convenient to copy and paste a portion of an NSEC3 or
NSEC3PARAM record into a command line to confirm the correctness of an
NSEC3 hash.

* ARGUMENTS

#+begin_quote
- *salt* :: This is the salt provided to the hash algorithm.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *algorithm* :: This is a number indicating the hash algorithm.
  Currently the only supported hash algorithm for NSEC3 is SHA-1, which
  is indicated by the number 1; consequently "1" is the only useful
  value for this argument.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *flags* :: This is provided for compatibility with NSEC3 record
  presentation format, but is ignored since the flags do not affect the
  hash.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *iterations* :: This is the number of additional times the hash should
  be performed.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *domain* :: This is the domain name to be hashed.

#+end_quote
