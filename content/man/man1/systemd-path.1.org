#+TITLE: Manpages - systemd-path.1
* NAME
systemd-path - List and query system and user paths

* SYNOPSIS
*systemd-path* [OPTIONS...] [NAME...]

* DESCRIPTION
*systemd-path* may be used to query system and user paths. The tool
makes many of the paths described in *file-hierarchy*(7) available for
querying.

When invoked without arguments, a list of known paths and their current
values is shown. When at least one argument is passed, the path with
this name is queried and its value shown. The variables whose name
begins with "search-" do not refer to individual paths, but instead to a
list of colon-separated search paths, in their order of precedence.

Note that paths which depend on environment variables are computed with
*systemd-path*s invoked environment, and not the system or user managers
environment. As such, the output of *systemd-path* may not reflect the
behavior of manager processes.
