* NAME
git-mergetool--lib - Common Git merge tool shell scriptlets

* SYNOPSIS
#+begin_example
TOOL_MODE=(diff|merge) . "$(git --exec-path)/git-mergetool--lib"
#+end_example

* DESCRIPTION
This is not a command the end user would want to run. Ever. This
documentation is meant for people who are studying the Porcelain-ish
scripts and/or are writing new ones.

The /git-mergetool--lib/ scriptlet is designed to be sourced (using *.*)
by other shell scripts to set up functions for working with Git merge
tools.

Before sourcing /git-mergetool--lib/, your script must set *TOOL_MODE*
to define the operation mode for the functions listed below. /diff/ and
/merge/ are valid values.
