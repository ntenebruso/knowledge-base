* NAME
kbdinfo - read information about keyboard state

* SYNOPSIS
*kbdinfo* [/options/] /getmode /[/text|graphics/]\\
*kbdinfo* [/options/] /gkbmode /[/raw|xlate|mediumraw|unicode/]\\
*kbdinfo* [/options/] /gkbmeta /[/metabit|escprefix/]\\
*kbdinfo* [/options/] /gkbled /[/scrolllock|numlock|capslock/]

* DESCRIPTION
The utility allows you to read and check various parameters of the
keyboard and virtual console.

- *getmode* :: Get or check virtual console mode.

- *gkbmode* :: Gets current keyboard mode.

#+begin_quote
- *raw* :: Raw (scancode) mode. These are the raw codes generated by the
  keyboard.

- *mediumraw* :: Medium raw (scancode) mode. This is extended medium raw
  mode, with keys above 127 encoded as 0, high 7 bits, low 7 bits, with
  the 0 bearing the 'up' flag if needed. 0 is reserved, so this
  shouldn't interfere with anything else. The two bytes after 0 will
  always have the up flag set not to interfere with older applications.
  This allows for 16384 different keycodes, which should be enough.

- *xlate* :: Translate keycodes using keymap. These are the codes
  generated via the current keysym mapping.

- *unicode* :: Unicode mode.

#+end_quote

- *gkbmeta* :: Gets meta key handling mode.

#+begin_quote
- *escprefix* :: Specifies if pressing the meta (alt) key generates an
  ESC (\033) prefix followed by the keysym.

- *metabit* :: The keysym marked with the high bit set.

#+end_quote

- *gkbled* :: Get keyboard flags CapsLock, NumLock, ScrollLock (not
  lights).

#+begin_quote
- *scrolllock* :: The scroll lock is down.

- *numlock* :: The num lock is down.

- *capslock* :: The caps lock is down.

#+end_quote

* OPTIONS
- *-C*, *--console*=/DEV/ :: the console device to be used;

- *-V*, *--version* :: print version number;

- *-h*, *--help* :: print this usage message.
