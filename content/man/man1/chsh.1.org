#+TITLE: Manpages - chsh.1
* NAME
chsh - change login shell

* SYNOPSIS
*chsh* [/options/] [/LOGIN/]

* DESCRIPTION
The *chsh* command changes the user login shell. This determines the
name of the users initial login command. A normal user may only change
the login shell for her own account; the superuser may change the login
shell for any account.

* OPTIONS
The options which apply to the *chsh* command are:

*-h*, *--help*

#+begin_quote
Display help message and exit.

#+end_quote

*-R*, *--root* /CHROOT_DIR/

#+begin_quote
Apply changes in the /CHROOT_DIR/ directory and use the configuration
files from the /CHROOT_DIR/ directory. Only absolute paths are
supported.

#+end_quote

*-s*, *--shell* /SHELL/

#+begin_quote
The name of the users new login shell. Setting this field to blank
causes the system to select the default login shell.

#+end_quote

If the *-s* option is not selected, *chsh* operates in an interactive
fashion, prompting the user with the current login shell. Enter the new
value to change the shell, or leave the line blank to use the current
one. The current shell is displayed between a pair of /[ ]/ marks.

* NOTE
The only restriction placed on the login shell is that the command name
must be listed in /etc/shells, unless the invoker is the superuser, and
then any value may be added. An account with a restricted login shell
may not change her login shell. For this reason, placing /bin/rsh in
/etc/shells is discouraged since accidentally changing to a restricted
shell would prevent the user from ever changing her login shell back to
its original value.

For this reason, placing /bin/rsh in /etc/shells is discouraged since
accidentally changing to a restricted shell would prevent the user from
ever changing her login shell back to its original value.
