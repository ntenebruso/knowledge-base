#+TITLE: Manpages - mren.1
* Name
mren - rename an existing MSDOS file

* Note of warning
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation, and may not be entirely accurate or complete. See the end
of this man page for details.

* Description
The =mren= command is used to rename or move an existing MS-DOS file or
subdirectory. Its syntax is:

#+begin_example
mren [-voOsSrRA] sourcefile targetfile
#+end_example

=Mren= renames an existing file on an MS-DOS file system.

In verbose mode, =Mren= displays the new filename if the name supplied
is invalid.

If the first syntax is used (only one source file), and if the target
name doesn't contain any slashes or colons, the file (or subdirectory)
is renamed in the same directory, instead of being moved to the current
=mcd= directory as would be the case with =mmove=. Unlike the MS-DOS
version of =REN=, =mren= can be used to rename directories.

* Viewing the texi doc
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation. However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process. Indeed, these items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format. Moreover, not all information has
been translated into the manpage version. Thus I strongly advise you to
use the original texinfo doc. See the end of this manpage for
instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

- *  :: To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the
  following commands:

#+begin_example
    ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi
#+end_example

- *  :: To generate a html copy, run:

#+begin_example
    ./configure; make html
#+end_example

A premade html can be found at

- *  :: To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs' info mode),
  run:

#+begin_example
    ./configure; make info
#+end_example

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html. Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.
