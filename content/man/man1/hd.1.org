* NAME
hexdump - display file contents in hexadecimal, decimal, octal, or ascii

*hexdump* /options file/ ...

*hd* /options file/ ...

* DESCRIPTION
The *hexdump* utility is a filter which displays the specified files, or
standard input if no files are specified, in a user-specified format.

* OPTIONS
Below, the /length/ and /offset/ arguments may be followed by the
multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for
GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has the
same meaning as "KiB"), or the suffixes KB (=1000), MB (=1000*1000), and
so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.

*-b*, *--one-byte-octal*

#+begin_quote
/One-byte octal display/. Display the input offset in hexadecimal,
followed by sixteen space-separated, three-column, zero-filled bytes of
input data, in octal, per line.

#+end_quote

*-c*, *--one-byte-char*

#+begin_quote
/One-byte character display/. Display the input offset in hexadecimal,
followed by sixteen space-separated, three-column, space-filled
characters of input data per line.

#+end_quote

*-C*, *--canonical*

#+begin_quote
/Canonical hex+ASCII display/. Display the input offset in hexadecimal,
followed by sixteen space-separated, two-column, hexadecimal bytes,
followed by the same sixteen bytes in *%_p* format enclosed in *|*
characters. Invoking the program as *hd* implies this option.

#+end_quote

*-d*, *--two-bytes-decimal*

#+begin_quote
/Two-byte decimal display/. Display the input offset in hexadecimal,
followed by eight space-separated, five-column, zero-filled, two-byte
units of input data, in unsigned decimal, per line.

#+end_quote

*-e*, *--format* /format_string/

#+begin_quote
Specify a format string to be used for displaying data.

#+end_quote

*-f*, *--format-file* /file/

#+begin_quote
Specify a file that contains one or more newline-separated format
strings. Empty lines and lines whose first non-blank character is a hash
mark (#) are ignored.

#+end_quote

*-L*, *--color*[=/when/]

#+begin_quote
Accept color units for the output. The optional argument /when/ can be
*auto*, *never* or *always*. If the /when/ argument is omitted, it
defaults to *auto*. The colors can be disabled; for the current built-in
default see the *--help* output. See also the *Colors* subsection and
the *COLORS* section below.

#+end_quote

*-n*, *--length* /length/

#+begin_quote
Interpret only /length/ bytes of input.

#+end_quote

*-o*, *--two-bytes-octal*

#+begin_quote
/Two-byte octal display/. Display the input offset in hexadecimal,
followed by eight space-separated, six-column, zero-filled, two-byte
quantities of input data, in octal, per line.

#+end_quote

*-s*, *--skip* /offset/

#+begin_quote
Skip /offset/ bytes from the beginning of the input.

#+end_quote

*-v*, *--no-squeezing*

#+begin_quote
The *-v* option causes *hexdump* to display all input data. Without the
*-v* option, any number of groups of output lines which would be
identical to the immediately preceding group of output lines (except for
the input offsets), are replaced with a line comprised of a single
asterisk.

#+end_quote

*-x*, *--two-bytes-hex*

#+begin_quote
/Two-byte hexadecimal display/. Display the input offset in hexadecimal,
followed by eight space-separated, four-column, zero-filled, two-byte
quantities of input data, in hexadecimal, per line.

#+end_quote

*-h*, *--help*

#+begin_quote
Display help text and exit.

#+end_quote

*-V*, *--version*

#+begin_quote
Print version and exit.

#+end_quote

For each input file, *hexdump* sequentially copies the input to standard
output, transforming the data according to the format strings specified
by the *-e* and *-f* options, in the order that they were specified.

* FORMATS
A format string contains any number of format units, separated by
whitespace. A format unit contains up to three items: an iteration
count, a byte count, and a format.

The iteration count is an optional positive integer, which defaults to
one. Each format is applied iteration count times.

The byte count is an optional positive integer. If specified it defines
the number of bytes to be interpreted by each iteration of the format.

If an iteration count and/or a byte count is specified, a single slash
must be placed after the iteration count and/or before the byte count to
disambiguate them. Any whitespace before or after the slash is ignored.

The format is required and must be surrounded by double quote (" ")
marks. It is interpreted as a fprintf-style format string (see
*fprintf*(3)), with the following exceptions:

1.

#+begin_quote
An asterisk (*) may not be used as a field width or precision.

#+end_quote

2.

#+begin_quote
A byte count or field precision /is/ required for each *s* conversion
character (unlike the *fprintf*(3) default which prints the entire
string if the precision is unspecified).

#+end_quote

3.

#+begin_quote
The conversion characters *h*, *l*, *n*, *p*, and *q* are not supported.

#+end_quote

4.

#+begin_quote
The single character escape sequences described in the C standard are
supported:

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
| NULL              | \0 |
| <alert character> | \a |
| <backspace>       | \b |
| <form-feed>       | \f |
| <newline>         | \n |
| <carriage return> | \r |
| <tab>             | \t |
| <vertical tab>    | \v |

\\

#+end_quote

** Conversion strings
The *hexdump* utility also supports the following additional conversion
strings.

*_a[dox]*

#+begin_quote
Display the input offset, cumulative across input files, of the next
byte to be displayed. The appended characters *d*, *o*, and *x* specify
the display base as decimal, octal or hexadecimal respectively.

#+end_quote

*_A[dox]*

#+begin_quote
Almost identical to the *_a* conversion string except that it is only
performed once, when all of the input data has been processed.

#+end_quote

*_c*

#+begin_quote
Output characters in the default character set. Non-printing characters
are displayed in three-character, zero-padded octal, except for those
representable by standard escape notation (see above), which are
displayed as two-character strings.

#+end_quote

*_p*

#+begin_quote
Output characters in the default character set. Non-printing characters
are displayed as a single *.*.

#+end_quote

*_u*

#+begin_quote
Output US ASCII characters, with the exception that control characters
are displayed using the following, lower-case, names. Characters greater
than 0xff, hexadecimal, are displayed as hexadecimal strings.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
| 000 nul | 001 soh | 002 stx | 003 etx | 004 eot | 005 enq |
| 006 ack | 007 bel | 008 bs  | 009 ht  | 00A lf  | 00B vt  |
| 00C ff  | 00D cr  | 00E so  | 00F si  | 010 dle | 011 dc1 |
| 012 dc2 | 013 dc3 | 014 dc4 | 015 nak | 016 syn | 017 etb |
| 018 can | 019 em  | 01A sub | 01B esc | 01C fs  | 01D gs  |
| 01E rs  | 01F us  | 0FF del |         |         |         |

#+end_quote

** Colors
When put at the end of a format specifier, *hexdump* highlights the
respective string with the color specified. Conditions, if present, are
evaluated prior to highlighting.

*_L[color_unit_1,color_unit_2,...,color_unit_n]*

The full syntax of a color unit is as follows:

*[!]COLOR[:VALUE][@OFFSET_START[-END]]*

*!*

#+begin_quote
Negate the condition. Please note that it only makes sense to negate a
unit if both a value/string and an offset are specified. In that case
the respective output string will be highlighted if and only if the
value/string does not match the one at the offset.

#+end_quote

*COLOR*

#+begin_quote
One of the 8 basic shell colors.

#+end_quote

*VALUE*

#+begin_quote
A value to be matched specified in hexadecimal, or octal base, or as a
string. Please note that the usual C escape sequences are not
interpreted by *hexdump* inside the color_units.

#+end_quote

*OFFSET*

#+begin_quote
An offset or an offset range at which to check for a match. Please note
that lone OFFSET_START uses the same value as END offset.

#+end_quote

** Counters
The default and supported byte counts for the conversion characters are
as follows:

*%_c*, *%_p*, *%_u*, *%c*

#+begin_quote
One byte counts only.

#+end_quote

*%d*, *%i*, *%o*, *%u*, *%X*, *%x*

#+begin_quote
Four byte default, one, two and four byte counts supported.

#+end_quote

*%E*, *%e*, *%f*, *%G*, *%g*

#+begin_quote
Eight byte default, four byte counts supported.

#+end_quote

The amount of data interpreted by each format string is the sum of the
data required by each format unit, which is the iteration count times
the byte count, or the iteration count times the number of bytes
required by the format if the byte count is not specified.

The input is manipulated in /blocks/, where a block is defined as the
largest amount of data specified by any format string. Format strings
interpreting less than an input block's worth of data, whose last format
unit both interprets some number of bytes and does not have a specified
iteration count, have the iteration count incremented until the entire
input block has been processed or there is not enough data remaining in
the block to satisfy the format string.

If, either as a result of user specification or *hexdump* modifying the
iteration count as described above, an iteration count is greater than
one, no trailing whitespace characters are output during the last
iteration.

It is an error to specify a byte count as well as multiple conversion
characters or strings unless all but one of the conversion characters or
strings is *_a* or *_A*.

If, as a result of the specification of the *-n* option or end-of-file
being reached, input data only partially satisfies a format string, the
input block is zero-padded sufficiently to display all available data
(i.e., any format units overlapping the end of data will display some
number of the zero bytes).

Further output by such format strings is replaced by an equivalent
number of spaces. An equivalent number of spaces is defined as the
number of spaces output by an *s* conversion character with the same
field width and precision as the original conversion character or
conversion string but with any *+*, , *#* conversion flag characters
removed, and referencing a NULL string.

If no format strings are specified, the default display is very similar
to the *-x* output format (the *-x* option causes more space to be used
between format units than in the default output).

* EXIT STATUS
*hexdump* exits 0 on success and > 0 if an error occurred.

* CONFORMING TO
The *hexdump* utility is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 ("POSIX.2")
compatible.

* EXAMPLES
Display the input in perusal format:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
   "%06.6_ao "  12/1 "%3_u "
   "\t" "%_p "
   "\n"
#+end_example

#+end_quote

Implement the *-x* option:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
   "%07.7_Ax\n"
   "%07.7_ax  " 8/2 "%04x " "\n"
#+end_example

#+end_quote

MBR Boot Signature example: Highlight the addresses cyan and the bytes
at offsets 510 and 511 green if their value is 0xAA55, red otherwise.

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
   "%07.7_Ax_L[cyan]\n"
   "%07.7_ax_L[cyan]  " 8/2 "   %04x_L[green:0xAA55@510-511,!red:0xAA55@510-511] " "\n"
#+end_example

#+end_quote

* COLORS
The output colorization is implemented by *terminal-colors.d*(5)
functionality. Implicit coloring can be disabled by an empty file

#+begin_quote
//etc/terminal-colors.d/hexdump.disable/\\

#+end_quote

for the *hexdump* command or for all tools by

#+begin_quote
//etc/terminal-colors.d/disable/\\

#+end_quote

The user-specific /$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/terminal-colors.d/ or
/$HOME/.config/terminal-colors.d/ overrides the global setting.

Note that the output colorization may be enabled by default, and in this
case /terminal-colors.d/ directories do not have to exist yet.
