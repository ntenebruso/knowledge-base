* NAME
pipewire - The PipeWire media server

* SYNOPSIS
*pipewire* [/options/]

* DESCRIPTION
PipeWire is a service that facilitates sharing of multimedia content
between devices and applications.

The *pipewire* daemon reads a config file that is further documented in
*pipewire.conf(5)* manual page.

* OPTIONS
*-h | --help*

#+begin_quote
Show help.

#+end_quote

*-v | --verbose*

#+begin_quote
Increase the verbosity by one level. This option may be specified
multiple times.

#+end_quote

*--version*

#+begin_quote
Show version information.

#+end_quote

*-c | --config=FILE*

#+begin_quote
Load the given config file (Default: pipewire.conf).

#+end_quote

*-P | --properties=PROPS*

#+begin_quote
Add the given properties as a SPA JSON object to the context.

#+end_quote

* RUNTIME SETTINGS
A PipeWire daemon will also expose a settings metadata object that can
be used to change some settings at runtime.

Normally these settings can bypass any of the restrictions listed in the
config options above, such as quantum and samplerate values.

The settings can be modified using *pw-metadata(1)*:

#+begin_example
pw-metadata -n settings                  # list settings
pw-metadata -n settings 0                # list server settings
pw-metadata -n settings 0 log.level 2    # modify a server setting
#+end_example

*log.level = INTEGER*

#+begin_quote
Change the log level of the PipeWire daemon.

#+end_quote

*clock.rate = INTEGER*

#+begin_quote
The default samplerate.

#+end_quote

*clock.allowed-rates = [ RATE1 RATE2... ]*

#+begin_quote
The allowed samplerates.

#+end_quote

*clock.force-rate = INTEGER*

#+begin_quote
Temporarily forces the graph to operate in a fixed sample rate. Both DSP
processing and devices will switch to the new rate immediately. Running
streams (PulseAudio, native and ALSA applications) will automatically
resample to match the new rate.

Set the value to 0 to allow the sample rate to vary again.

#+end_quote

*clock.quantum = INTEGER*

#+begin_quote
The default quantum (buffer size).

#+end_quote

*clock.min-quantum = INTEGER*

#+begin_quote
Smallest quantum to be used.

#+end_quote

*clock.max-quantum = INTEGER*

#+begin_quote
Largest quantum to be used.

#+end_quote

*clock.force-quantum = INTEGER*

#+begin_quote
Temporarily force the graph to operate in a fixed quantum.

Set the value to 0 to allow the quantum to vary again.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
Name of the socket to connect to.

#+end_quote

#+end_quote

*PIPEWIRE_NO_CONFIG *

#+begin_quote
Enables (false) or disables (true) overriding on the default
configuration.

#+end_quote

** Context information
As part of a client context, the following information is collected from
environment variables and placed in the context properties:

*LANG *

#+begin_quote
The current language in application.language.

#+end_quote

*XDG_SESSION_ID *

#+begin_quote
Set as the application.process.session-id property.

#+end_quote

Is set as the window.x11.display property.

#+end_quote

** Modules
*PIPEWIRE_MODULE_DIR *

#+begin_quote
Sets the directory where to find PipeWire modules.

#+end_quote

*SPA_SUPPORT_LIB *

#+begin_quote
The name of the SPA support lib to load. This can be used to switch to
an alternative support library, for example, to run on the EVL realtime
kernel.

#+end_quote

** Logging options
*JOURNAL_STREAM *

#+begin_quote
Is used to parse the stream used for the journal. This is usually
configured by systemd.

#+end_quote

*PIPEWIRE_LOG_LINE *

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

*PIPEWIRE_LOG *

#+begin_quote

suggestion but the configured latency will not be larger.

#+end_quote

*PIPEWIRE_RATE *

#+begin_quote
Sets a rate for a stream or filter. This is only a suggestion. The rate
will be switched when the graph is idle.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
Overrides the default stream autoconnect settings.

#+end_quote

*SPA_DEBUG *

PIPEWIRE_DEBUG variable when the plugins are managed by PipeWire but
some standalone tools (like spa-inspect) uses this variable.

#+end_quote
