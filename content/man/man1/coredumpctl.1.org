#+TITLE: Manpages - coredumpctl.1
* NAME
coredumpctl - Retrieve and process saved core dumps and metadata

* SYNOPSIS
*coredumpctl* [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND} [PID|COMM|EXE|MATCH...]

* DESCRIPTION
*coredumpctl* is a tool that can be used to retrieve and process core
dumps and metadata which were saved by *systemd-coredump*(8).

* COMMANDS
The following commands are understood:

*list*

#+begin_quote
List core dumps captured in the journal matching specified
characteristics. If no command is specified, this is the implied
default.

The output is designed to be human readable and contains a table with
the following columns:

TIME

#+begin_quote
The timestamp of the crash, as reported by the kernel.

Added in version 233.

#+end_quote

PID

#+begin_quote
The identifier of the process that crashed.

Added in version 233.

#+end_quote

UID, GID

#+begin_quote
The user and group identifiers of the process that crashed.

Added in version 233.

#+end_quote

SIGNAL

#+begin_quote
The signal that caused the process to crash, when applicable.

Added in version 233.

#+end_quote

COREFILE

#+begin_quote
Information whether the coredump was stored, and whether it is still
accessible: "none" means the core was not stored, "-" means that it was
not available (for example because the process was not terminated by a
signal), "present" means that the core file is accessible by the current
user, "journal" means that the core was stored in the "journal",
"truncated" is the same as one of the previous two, but the core was too
large and was not stored in its entirety, "error" means that the core
file cannot be accessed, most likely because of insufficient
permissions, and "missing" means that the core was stored in a file, but
this file has since been removed.

Added in version 233.

#+end_quote

EXE

#+begin_quote
The full path to the executable. For backtraces of scripts this is the
name of the interpreter.

Added in version 233.

#+end_quote

Its worth noting that different restrictions apply to data saved in the
journal and core dump files saved in /var/lib/systemd/coredump, see
overview in *systemd-coredump*(8). Thus it may very well happen that a
particular core dump is still listed in the journal while its
corresponding core dump file has already been removed.

Added in version 215.

#+end_quote

*info*

#+begin_quote
Show detailed information about the last core dump or core dumps
matching specified characteristics captured in the journal.

Added in version 215.

#+end_quote

*dump*

#+begin_quote
Extract the last core dump matching specified characteristics. The core
dump will be written on standard output, unless an output file is
specified with *--output=*.

Added in version 215.

#+end_quote

*debug*

#+begin_quote
Invoke a debugger on the last core dump matching specified
characteristics. By default, *gdb*(1) will be used. This may be changed
using the *--debugger=* option or the /$SYSTEMD_DEBUGGER/ environment
variable. Use the *--debugger-arguments=* option to pass extra command
line arguments to the debugger.

Added in version 239.

#+end_quote

* OPTIONS
The following options are understood:

*-h*, *--help*

#+begin_quote
Print a short help text and exit.

#+end_quote

*--version*

#+begin_quote
Print a short version string and exit.

#+end_quote

*--no-pager*

#+begin_quote
Do not pipe output into a pager.

#+end_quote

*--no-legend*

#+begin_quote
Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer with hints.

#+end_quote

*--json=*/MODE/

#+begin_quote
Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for the shortest
possible output without any redundant whitespace or line breaks),
"pretty" (for a pretty version of the same, with indentation and line
breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON output, the default).

#+end_quote

*-1*

#+begin_quote
Show information of the most recent core dump only, instead of listing
all known core dumps. Equivalent to *--reverse -n 1*.

Added in version 215.

#+end_quote

*-n* /INT/

#+begin_quote
Show at most the specified number of entries. The specified parameter
must be an integer greater or equal to 1.

Added in version 248.

#+end_quote

*-S*, *--since*

#+begin_quote
Only print entries which are since the specified date.

Added in version 233.

#+end_quote

*-U*, *--until*

#+begin_quote
Only print entries which are until the specified date.

Added in version 233.

#+end_quote

*-r*, *--reverse*

#+begin_quote
Reverse output so that the newest entries are displayed first.

Added in version 233.

#+end_quote

*-F* /FIELD/, *--field=*/FIELD/

#+begin_quote
Print all possible data values the specified field takes in matching
core dump entries of the journal.

Added in version 215.

#+end_quote

*-o* /FILE/, *--output=*/FILE/

#+begin_quote
Write the core to *FILE*.

Added in version 215.

#+end_quote

*--debugger=*/DEBUGGER/

#+begin_quote
Use the given debugger for the *debug* command. If not given and
/$SYSTEMD_DEBUGGER/ is unset, then *gdb*(1) will be used.

Added in version 239.

#+end_quote

*-A* /ARGS/, *--debugger-arguments=*/ARGS/

#+begin_quote
Pass the given /ARGS/ as extra command line arguments to the debugger.
Quote as appropriate when /ARGS/ contain whitespace. (See Examples.)

Added in version 248.

#+end_quote

*--file=*/GLOB/

#+begin_quote
Takes a file glob as an argument. If specified, coredumpctl will operate
on the specified journal files matching /GLOB/ instead of the default
runtime and system journal paths. May be specified multiple times, in
which case files will be suitably interleaved.

Added in version 246.

#+end_quote

*-D* /DIR/, *--directory=*/DIR/

#+begin_quote
Use the journal files in the specified *DIR*.

Added in version 225.

#+end_quote

*--root=*/ROOT/

#+begin_quote
Use root directory *ROOT* when searching for coredumps.

Added in version 252.

#+end_quote

*--image=*/image/

#+begin_quote
Takes a path to a disk image file or block device node. If specified,
all operations are applied to file system in the indicated disk image.
This option is similar to *--root=*, but operates on file systems stored
in disk images or block devices. The disk image should either contain
just a file system or a set of file systems within a GPT partition
table, following the *Discoverable Partitions Specification*[1]. For
further information on supported disk images, see *systemd-nspawn*(1)s
switch of the same name.

Added in version 252.

#+end_quote

*--image-policy=*/policy/

#+begin_quote
Takes an image policy string as argument, as per
*systemd.image-policy*(7). The policy is enforced when operating on the
disk image specified via *--image=*, see above. If not specified
defaults to the "*" policy, i.e. all recognized file systems in the
image are used.

#+end_quote

*-q*, *--quiet*

#+begin_quote
Suppresses informational messages about lack of access to journal files
and possible in-flight coredumps.

Added in version 233.

#+end_quote

*--all*

#+begin_quote
Look at all available journal files in /var/log/journal/ (excluding
journal namespaces) instead of only local ones.

Added in version 250.

#+end_quote

* MATCHING
A match can be:

/PID/

#+begin_quote
Process ID of the process that dumped core. An integer.

Added in version 215.

#+end_quote

/COMM/

#+begin_quote
Name of the executable (matches *COREDUMP_COMM=*). Must not contain
slashes.

Added in version 215.

#+end_quote

one slash.

Added in version 215.

#+end_quote

/MATCH/

#+begin_quote
General journalctl match filter, must contain an equals sign ("="). See
*journalctl*(1).

Added in version 215.

#+end_quote

* EXIT STATUS
On success, 0 is returned; otherwise, a non-zero failure code is
returned. Not finding any matching core dumps is treated as failure.

* ENVIRONMENT
/$SYSTEMD_DEBUGGER/

#+begin_quote
Use the given debugger for the *debug* command. See the *--debugger=*
option.

Added in version 239.

#+end_quote

* EXAMPLES
*Example 1. List all the core dumps of a program*

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ coredumpctl list /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox
TIME       PID  UID  GID SIG     COREFILE EXE                         SIZE
Tue ...   8018 1000 1000 SIGSEGV missing  /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox     -
Wed ... 251609 1000 1000 SIGTRAP missing  /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox     -
Fri ... 552351 1000 1000 SIGSEGV present  /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox 28.7M
#+end_example

#+end_quote

The journal has three entries pertaining to /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox,
and only the last entry still has an available core file (in external
storage on disk).

Note that coredumpctl needs access to the journal files to retrieve the
relevant entries from the journal. Thus, an unprivileged user will
normally only see information about crashing programs of this user.

*Example 2. Invoke gdb on the last core dump*

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ coredumpctl debug
#+end_example

#+end_quote

*Example 3. Use gdb to display full register info from the last core
dump*

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ coredumpctl debug --debugger-arguments="-batch -ex info all-registers"
#+end_example

#+end_quote

*Example 4. Show information about a core dump matched by PID*
