* SYNOPSIS

* DESCRIPTION

#+begin_quote

*Note*

\\

You probably don't want to invoke this command yourself; it is started
automatically when you use *git-credential-cache*(1).

#+end_quote

This command listens on the Unix domain socket specified by
*<socket-path>* for *git-credential-cache* clients. Clients may store
and retrieve credentials. Each credential is held for a timeout
specified by the client; once no credentials are held, the daemon exits.

If the *--debug* option is specified, the daemon does not close its
stderr stream, and may output extra diagnostics to it even after it has
begun listening for clients.

* GIT
Part of the *git*(1) suite
