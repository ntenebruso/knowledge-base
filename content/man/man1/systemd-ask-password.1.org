* NAME
systemd-ask-password - Query the user for a system password

* SYNOPSIS
*systemd-ask-password* [OPTIONS...] [MESSAGE]

* DESCRIPTION
*systemd-ask-password* may be used to query a system password or
passphrase from the user, using a question message specified on the
command line. When run from a TTY it will query a password on the TTY
and print it to standard output. When run with no TTY or with *--no-tty*
it will use the system-wide query mechanism, which allows active users
to respond via several agents, listed below.

The purpose of this tool is to query system-wide passwords --- that is
passwords not attached to a specific user account. Examples include:
unlocking encrypted hard disks when they are plugged in or at boot,
entering an SSL certificate passphrase for web and VPN servers.

Existing agents are:

#+begin_quote
·

A boot-time password agent asking the user for passwords using
*plymouth*(8),

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
·

A boot-time password agent querying the user directly on the console ---
*systemd-ask-password-console.service*(8),

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
·

An agent requesting password input via a *wall*(1) message ---
*systemd-ask-password-wall.service*(8),

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
·

A TTY agent that is temporarily spawned during *systemctl*(1)
invocations,

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
·

A command line agent which can be started temporarily to process queued
password requests --- *systemd-tty-ask-password-agent --query*.

#+end_quote

Answering system-wide password queries is a privileged operation, hence
all the agents listed above (except for the last one), run as privileged
system services. The last one also needs elevated privileges, so should
be run through *sudo*(8) or similar.

Additional password agents may be implemented according to the *systemd
Password Agent Specification*[1].

If a password is queried on a TTY, the user may press TAB to hide the
asterisks normally shown for each character typed. Pressing Backspace as
first key achieves the same effect.

* OPTIONS
The following options are understood:

*--icon=*

#+begin_quote
Specify an icon name alongside the password query, which may be used in
all agents supporting graphical display. The icon name should follow the
*XDG Icon Naming Specification*[2].

#+end_quote

*--id=*

#+begin_quote
Specify an identifier for this password query. This identifier is freely
choosable and allows recognition of queries by involved agents. It
should include the subsystem doing the query and the specific object the
query is done for. Example: "--id=cryptsetup:/dev/sda5".

Added in version 227.

#+end_quote

*--keyname=*

#+begin_quote
Configure a kernel keyring key name to use as cache for the password. If
set, then the tool will try to push any collected passwords into the
kernel keyring of the root user, as a key of the specified name. If
combined with *--accept-cached*, it will also try to retrieve such
cached passwords from the key in the kernel keyring instead of querying
the user right away. By using this option, the kernel keyring may be
used as effective cache to avoid repeatedly asking users for passwords,
if there are multiple objects that may be unlocked with the same
password. The cached key will have a timeout of 2.5min set, after which
it will be purged from the kernel keyring. Note that it is possible to
cache multiple passwords under the same keyname, in which case they will
be stored as *NUL*-separated list of passwords. Use *keyctl*(1) to
access the cached key via the kernel keyring directly. Example:
"--keyname=cryptsetup"

Added in version 227.

#+end_quote

*--credential=*

#+begin_quote
Configure a credential to read the password from -- if it exists. This
may be used in conjunction with the /ImportCredential=/,
/LoadCredential=/ and /SetCredential=/ settings in unit files. See
*systemd.exec*(5) for details. If not specified, defaults to "password".
This option has no effect if no credentials directory is passed to the
program (i.e. /$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY/ is not set) or if the no
credential of the specified name exists.

Added in version 249.

#+end_quote

*--timeout=*

#+begin_quote
Specify the query timeout in seconds. Defaults to 90s. A timeout of 0
waits indefinitely.

#+end_quote

*--echo=yes|no|masked*

#+begin_quote
Controls whether to echo user input. Takes a boolean or the special
string "masked", the default being the latter. If enabled the typed
characters are echoed literally, which is useful for prompting for
usernames and other non-protected data. If disabled the typed characters
are not echoed in any form, the user will not get feedback on their
input. If set to "masked", an asterisk ("*") is echoed for each
character typed. In this mode, if the user hits the tabulator key ("↹"),
echo is turned off. (Alternatively, if the user hits the backspace key
("⌫") while no data has been entered otherwise, echo is turned off,
too).

Added in version 249.

#+end_quote

*--echo*, *-e*

#+begin_quote
Equivalent to *--echo=yes*, see above.

Added in version 217.

#+end_quote

*--emoji=yes|no|auto*

#+begin_quote
Controls whether or not to prefix the query with a lock and key emoji
(🔐), if the TTY settings permit this. The default is "auto", which
defaults to "yes", unless *--echo=yes* is given.

Added in version 249.

#+end_quote

*--no-tty*

#+begin_quote
Never ask for password on current TTY even if one is available. Always
use agent system.

#+end_quote

*--accept-cached*

#+begin_quote
If passed, accept cached passwords, i.e. passwords previously entered.

#+end_quote

*--multiple*

#+begin_quote
When used in conjunction with *--accept-cached* accept multiple
passwords. This will output one password per line.

#+end_quote

*--no-output*

#+begin_quote
Do not print passwords to standard output. This is useful if you want to
store a password in kernel keyring with *--keyname=* but do not want it
to show up on screen or in logs.

Added in version 230.

#+end_quote

*-n*

#+begin_quote
By default, when the acquired password is written to standard output it
is suffixed by a newline character. This may be turned off with the *-n*
switch, similarly to the switch of the same name of the *echo*(1)
command.

Added in version 249.

#+end_quote

*-h*, *--help*

#+begin_quote
Print a short help text and exit.

#+end_quote

* EXIT STATUS
On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
