* Name
=nix profile list= - list installed packages

* Synopsis
=nix profile list= [/option/...]

* Examples
- Show what packages are installed in the default profile:

#+begin_example
# nix profile list
Name:               gdb
Flake attribute:    legacyPackages.x86_64-linux.gdb
Original flake URL: flake:nixpkgs
Locked flake URL:   github:NixOS/nixpkgs/7b38b03d76ab71bdc8dc325e3f6338d984cc35ca
Store paths:        /nix/store/indzcw5wvlhx6vwk7k4iq29q15chvr3d-gdb-11.1

Name:               blender-bin
Flake attribute:    packages.x86_64-linux.default
Original flake URL: flake:blender-bin
Locked flake URL:   github:edolstra/nix-warez/91f2ffee657bf834e4475865ae336e2379282d34?dir=blender
Store paths:        /nix/store/i798sxl3j40wpdi1rgf391id1b5klw7g-blender-bin-3.1.2
#+end_example

#+begin_quote
Note that you can unambiguously rebuild a package from a profile through
its locked flake URL and flake attribute, e.g.

#+end_quote

#+begin_example
# nix build github:edolstra/nix-warez/91f2ffee657bf834e4475865ae336e2379282d34?dir=blender#packages.x86_64-linux.default
#+end_example

#+begin_quote
will build the package =blender-bin= shown above.

#+end_quote

* Description
This command shows what packages are currently installed in a profile.
For each installed package, it shows the following information:

- =Name=: A unique name used to unambiguously identify the package in
  invocations of =nix profile remove= and =nix profile= upgrade.

- =Index=: An integer that can be used to unambiguously identify the
  package in invocations of =nix profile remove= and
  =nix profile upgrade=. (/Deprecated, will be removed in a future
  version in favor of =Name=./)

- =Flake attribute=: The flake output attribute path that provides the
  package (e.g. =packages.x86_64-linux.hello=).

- =Original flake URL=: The original (“unlocked”) flake reference
  specified by the user when the package was first installed via =nix=
  profile install.

- =Locked flake URL=: The locked flake reference to which the original
  flake reference was resolved.

- =Store paths=: The store path(s) of the package.

* Options
- =--json=

  Produce output in JSON format, suitable for consumption by another
  program.

- =--profile= /path/

  The profile to operate on.

** Common evaluation options
- =--arg= /name/ /expr/

  Pass the value /expr/ as the argument /name/ to Nix functions.

- =--arg-from-file= /name/ /path/

  Pass the contents of file /path/ as the argument /name/ to Nix
  functions.

- =--arg-from-stdin= /name/

  Pass the contents of stdin as the argument /name/ to Nix functions.

- =--argstr= /name/ /string/

  Pass the string /string/ as the argument /name/ to Nix functions.

- =--debugger=

  Start an interactive environment if evaluation fails.

- =--eval-store= /store-url/

  The *URL of the Nix store* to use for evaluation, i.e. to store
  derivations (=.drv= files) and inputs referenced by them.

- =--impure=

  Allow access to mutable paths and repositories.

- =--include= / =-I= /path/

  Add /path/ to search path entries used to resolve *lookup paths*

  This option may be given multiple times.

  Paths added through =-I= take precedence over the =nix-path=
  configuration setting and the =NIX_PATH= environment variable.

- =--override-flake= /original-ref/ /resolved-ref/

  Override the flake registries, redirecting /original-ref/ to
  /resolved-ref/.

** Logging-related options
- =--debug=

  Set the logging verbosity level to ‘debug'.

- =--log-format= /format/

  Set the format of log output; one of =raw=, =internal-json=, =bar= or
  =bar-with-logs=.

- =--print-build-logs= / =-L=

  Print full build logs on standard error.

- =--quiet=

  Decrease the logging verbosity level.

- =--verbose= / =-v=

  Increase the logging verbosity level.

** Miscellaneous global options
- =--help=

  Show usage information.

- =--offline=

  Disable substituters and consider all previously downloaded files
  up-to-date.

- =--option= /name/ /value/

  Set the Nix configuration setting /name/ to /value/ (overriding
  =nix.conf=).

- =--refresh=

  Consider all previously downloaded files out-of-date.

- =--repair=

  During evaluation, rewrite missing or corrupted files in the Nix
  store. During building, rebuild missing or corrupted store paths.

- =--version=

  Show version information.

  *Note*

  See =man nix.conf= for overriding configuration settings with command
  line flags.
