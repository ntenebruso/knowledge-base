#+TITLE: Manpages - floppyd.1
* Name
floppyd - floppy daemon for remote access to floppy drive

* Note of warning
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation, and may not be entirely accurate or complete. See the end
of this man page for details.

* Description
=Floppyd= is used as a server to grant access to the floppy drive to
clients running on a remote machine, just as an X server grants access
to the display to remote clients. It has the following syntax:

=floppyd= [=-d=] [=-l=] [=-s= /port/] [=-r= /user/] [=-b= /ipaddr/]
[=-x= /display/] /devicenames/

=floppyd= is always associated with an X server. It runs on the same
machine as its X server, and listens on port 5703 and above.

* Authentication
=floppyd= authenticates remote clients using the =Xauthority= protocol.
Xhost authentication is not supported. Each floppyd is associated with
an X server. When a remote client attempts to connect to floppyd, it
sends floppyd the X authority record corresponding to floppyd's X
server. Floppyd in turn then tries to open up a connection to the X
server in order to verify the authenticity of the xauth record. If the
connection to the X server succeeds, the client is granted access.
=DISPLAY=.

*Caution*: In order to make authentication work correctly, the local
host should *not* be listed in the =xhost= list of allowed hosts.
Indeed, hosts listed in =xhost= do not need a correct =Xauthority=
cookie to connect to the X server. As =floppyd= runs on the same host as
the X server, all its probe connection would succeed even for clients
who supplied a bad cookie. This means that your floppy drive would be
open to the world, i.e. a huge security hole. If your X server does not
allow you to remove =localhost:0= and =:0= from the =xhost= list, you
can prevent floppyd from probing those display names with the =-l=
option.

* Command line options
- =d=  :: Daemon mode. Floppyd runs its own server loop. Do not supply
  this if you start floppyd from =inetd.conf=

- =s  =/port/  :: Port number for daemon mode. Default is 5703 +
  /displaynumber/. This flag implies daemon mode. For example, for
  display =hitchhiker:5=, the port would be 5708.

- =b  =/ipaddr/  :: Bind address (for multi homed hosts). This flag
  implies daemon mode

- =r =/user/  :: Run the server under as the given user

- =x =/display/  :: X display to use for authentication. By default,
  this is taken from the =DISPLAY= variable. If neither the =x=
  attribute is present nor =DISPLAY= is set, floppyd uses =:0.0=.

/devicenames/ is a list of device nodes to be opened. Default is
=/dev/fd0=. Multiple devices are only supported on mtools versions newer
than 3.9.11.

* Connecting to floppyd
In order to use floppyd, add the flag =remote= to the device description
in your =∞~/.mtoolsrc∫= file. If the flag =remote= is given, the =file=
parameter of the device description is taken to be a remote address.
It's format is the following:
/hostname/=:=/displaynumber/[=/=[/baseport/][=/=/drive/]]. When using
this entry, mtools connects to port /baseport/+/displaynumber/ at
/hostname/. By default /baseport/ is 5703. The drive parameter is to
distinguish among multiple drives associated with a single display (only
mtools versions more recent than 3.9.11)

* Examples:
The following starts a floppy daemon giving access to =∞/dev/fd0∫=,
listening on the default port 5703, tied to the default X servers:

#+begin_example
floppyd -d /dev/fd0
#+end_example

Each of the following starts a floppy daemon giving access to
=∞/dev/fd1∫=, tied to the :1 local X servers, and listening on
port 5704. We assume that the local host is named =hitchhiker=.

#+begin_example
floppyd -d /dev/fd0
floppyd -d -x :1 -p 5704 /dev/fd0 
#+end_example

If you want to start floppyd by =inetd= instead of running it as a
daemon, insert the following lines into =∞/etc/services∫=:

#+begin_example
# floppy daemon
floppyd-0    5703/tcp    # floppy daemon for X server :0
floppyd-1    5704/tcp    # floppy daemon for X server :1
#+end_example

And insert the following into =∞/etc/inetd.conf∫= (assuming that you
have defined a user named floppy in your =∞/etc/passwd∫=):

#+begin_example
# floppy daemon
floppyd-0 stream  tcp  wait  floppy  /usr/sbin/floppyd floppyd /dev/fd0 
floppyd-1 stream  tcp  wait  floppy  /usr/sbin/floppyd floppyd -x :1 /dev/fd0 
#+end_example

Note that you need to supply the X display names for the second floppyd.
This is because the port is opened by inetd.conf, and hence floppyd
cannot know its number to interfere the display number.

On the client side, insert the following into your =∞~/.mtoolsrc∫= to
define a drive letter accessing floppy drive in your X terminal:

#+begin_example
drive x: file="$DISPLAY" remote
#+end_example

If your X terminal has more than one drive, you may access the
additional drives as follows:

#+begin_example
drive y: file="$DISPLAY//1" remote
drive z: file="$DISPLAY//2" remote
#+end_example

* Viewing the texi doc
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation. However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process. Indeed, these items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format. Moreover, not all information has
been translated into the manpage version. Thus I strongly advise you to
use the original texinfo doc. See the end of this manpage for
instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

- *  :: To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the
  following commands:

#+begin_example
    ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi
#+end_example

- *  :: To generate a html copy, run:

#+begin_example
    ./configure; make html
#+end_example

- *  :: To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs' info mode),
  run:

#+begin_example
    ./configure; make info
#+end_example

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html. Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.
