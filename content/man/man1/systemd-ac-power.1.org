#+TITLE: Manpages - systemd-ac-power.1
* NAME
systemd-ac-power - Report whether we are connected to an external power
source

* SYNOPSIS
*systemd-ac-power* [OPTIONS...]

* DESCRIPTION
*systemd-ac-power* may be used to check whether the system is running on
AC power or not. By default it will simply return success (if we can
detect that we are running on AC power) or failure, with no output. This
can be useful for example to debug /ConditionACPower=/ (see
*systemd.unit*(5)).

* OPTIONS
The following options are understood:

*-v*, *--verbose*

#+begin_quote
Show result as text instead of just returning success or failure.

Added in version 253.

#+end_quote

*--low*

#+begin_quote
Instead of showing AC power state, show low battery state. In this case
will return zero if all batteries are currently discharging and below 5%
of maximum charge. Returns non-zero otherwise.

Added in version 254.

#+end_quote

*-h*, *--help*

#+begin_quote
Print a short help text and exit.

#+end_quote

*--version*

#+begin_quote
Print a short version string and exit.

#+end_quote

* EXIT STATUS
On success (running on AC power), 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code
otherwise.
