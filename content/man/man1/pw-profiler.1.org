#+TITLE: Manpages - pw-profiler.1
* NAME
pw-profiler - The PipeWire profiler

* SYNOPSIS
*pw-profiler* [/options/]

* DESCRIPTION
Start profiling a PipeWire instance.

If the server has the profiler module loaded, this program will connect
to it and log the profiler data. Profiler data contains times and
durations when processing nodes and devices started and completed.

When this program is stopped, a set of *gnuplot* files and a script to
generate SVG files from the .plot files is generated, along with a .html
file to visualize the profiling results in a browser.

This function uses the same data used by /pw-top/.
