#+TITLE: Manpages - infotocap.1m
* NAME
*infotocap* - convert a /terminfo/ description into a /termcap/
description

* SYNOPSIS
*infotocap* [*-v*/n/ /width/] [*-V*] [*-1*] [*-w* /width/] /file/ ...

* DESCRIPTION
*infotocap* looks in each given text /file/ for *terminfo* descriptions.
For each terminfo description found, an equivalent *termcap* description
is written to standard output. Terminfo *use* capabilities are
translated directly to termcap *tc* capabilities.

- *-v* :: print out tracing information on standard error as the program
  runs.

- *-V* :: print out the version of the program in use on standard error
  and exit.

- *-1* :: cause the fields to print out one to a line. Otherwise, the
  fields will be printed several to a line to a maximum width of 60
  characters.

- *-w* :: change the output to /width/ characters.

* FILES
- /nix/store/53iigsmf32bwkfdhhihq2rppgk23k2rg-ncurses-6.4.20221231/share/terminfo :: Compiled
  terminal description database.

* NOTES
This utility is actually a link to *tic*, running in /-C/ mode. You can
use other *tic* options such as *-f* and *-x*.

* PORTABILITY
None of X/Open Curses, Issue 7 (2009), SVr4 or NetBSD document this
application.

* SEE ALSO
*infocmp*(1M), *tic*(1M), *curses*(3X), *terminfo*(5)

This describes *ncurses* version 6.4 (patch 20221231).
