* Name
=nix derivation add= - Add a store derivation

* Synopsis
=nix derivation add= [/option/...]

* Description
This command reads from standard input a JSON representation of a *store
derivation* to which an /installable/ evaluates.

Store derivations are used internally by Nix. They are store paths with
extension =.drv= that represent the build-time dependency graph to which
a Nix expression evaluates.

=nix derivation add= takes a single derivation in the following format:

{{#include ../../protocols/json/derivation.md}}
