#+TITLE: Manpages - mk_cmds.1
* NAME
mk_cmds - error table compiler

* SYNOPSIS
*mk_cmds* file

* DESCRIPTION
*Mk_cmds* converts a table listing command names and associated help
messages into a C source file suitable for use with the /ss/(3) library.

The source file name must end with a suffix of ``.ct''; the file
consists of a declaration supplying the name of the command table:

*command_table* /name/

followed by entries of the form:

[ *request* | *unimplemented* ] /name,/ " /string/ "[, abbrev]...;

and a final

*end*

to indicate the end of the table.

A C source file is generated which should be compiled and linked with
the object files use the ss library.

A ``#'' in the source file is treated as a comment character, and all
remaining text to the end of the source line will be ignored.

* BUGS
Since the original *mk_cmds* uses a very simple parser based on
/yacc/(1), and this current version of *mk_cmds* uses an awk/sed
combination of scripts, its error recovery leaves much to be desired.

* SEE ALSO
ss (3)
