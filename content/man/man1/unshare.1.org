#+TITLE: Manpages - unshare.1
* NAME
unshare - run program in new namespaces

* SYNOPSIS
*unshare* [options] [/program/ [/arguments/]]

* DESCRIPTION
The *unshare* command creates new namespaces (as specified by the
command-line options described below) and then executes the specified
/program/. If /program/ is not given, then "${SHELL}" is run (default:
//bin/sh/).

By default, a new namespace persists only as long as it has member
processes. A new namespace can be made persistent even when it has no
member processes by bind mounting /proc//pid//ns//type/ files to a
filesystem path. A namespace that has been made persistent in this way
can subsequently be entered with *nsenter*(1) even after the /program/
terminates (except PID namespaces where a permanently running init
process is required). Once a persistent namespace is no longer needed,
it can be unpersisted by using *umount*(8) to remove the bind mount. See
the *EXAMPLES* section for more details.

*unshare* since util-linux version 2.36 uses
//proc/[pid]/ns/pid_for_children/ and //proc/[pid]/ns/time_for_children/
files for persistent PID and TIME namespaces. This change requires Linux
kernel 4.17 or newer.

The following types of namespaces can be created with *unshare*:

*mount namespace*

#+begin_quote
Mounting and unmounting filesystems will not affect the rest of the
system, except for filesystems which are explicitly marked as shared
(with *mount --make-shared*; see //proc/self/mountinfo/ or *findmnt
-o+PROPAGATION* for the *shared* flags). For further details, see
*mount_namespaces*(7).

*unshare* since util-linux version 2.27 automatically sets propagation
to *private* in a new mount namespace to make sure that the new
namespace is really unshared. It's possible to disable this feature with
option *--propagation unchanged*. Note that *private* is the kernel
default.

#+end_quote

*UTS namespace*

#+begin_quote
Setting hostname or domainname will not affect the rest of the system.
For further details, see *uts_namespaces*(7).

#+end_quote

*IPC namespace*

#+begin_quote
The process will have an independent namespace for POSIX message queues
as well as System V message queues, semaphore sets and shared memory
segments. For further details, see *ipc_namespaces*(7).

#+end_quote

*network namespace*

#+begin_quote
The process will have independent IPv4 and IPv6 stacks, IP routing
tables, firewall rules, the //proc/net/ and //sys/class/net/ directory
trees, sockets, etc. For further details, see *network_namespaces*(7).

#+end_quote

*PID namespace*

#+begin_quote
Children will have a distinct set of PID-to-process mappings from their
parent. For further details, see *pid_namespaces*(7).

#+end_quote

*cgroup namespace*

#+begin_quote
The process will have a virtualized view of //proc/self/cgroup/, and new
cgroup mounts will be rooted at the namespace cgroup root. For further
details, see *cgroup_namespaces*(7).

#+end_quote

*user namespace*

#+begin_quote
The process will have a distinct set of UIDs, GIDs and capabilities. For
further details, see *user_namespaces*(7).

#+end_quote

*time namespace*

#+begin_quote
The process can have a distinct view of *CLOCK_MONOTONIC* and/or
*CLOCK_BOOTTIME* which can be changed using //proc/self/timens_offsets/.
For further details, see *time_namespaces*(7).

#+end_quote

* OPTIONS
*-i*, *--ipc*[*=*/file/]

#+begin_quote
Create a new IPC namespace. If /file/ is specified, then the namespace
is made persistent by creating a bind mount at /file/.

#+end_quote

*-m*, *--mount*[*=*/file/]

#+begin_quote
Create a new mount namespace. If /file/ is specified, then the namespace
is made persistent by creating a bind mount at /file/. Note that /file/
must be located on a mount whose propagation type is not *shared* (or an
error results). Use the command *findmnt -o+PROPAGATION* when not sure
about the current setting. See also the examples below.

#+end_quote

*-n*, *--net*[*=*/file/]

#+begin_quote
Create a new network namespace. If /file/ is specified, then the
namespace is made persistent by creating a bind mount at /file/.

#+end_quote

*-p*, *--pid*[*=*/file/]

#+begin_quote
Create a new PID namespace. If /file/ is specified, then the namespace
is made persistent by creating a bind mount at /file/. (Creation of a
persistent PID namespace will fail if the *--fork* option is not also
specified.)

See also the *--fork* and *--mount-proc* options.

#+end_quote

*-u*, *--uts*[*=*/file/]

#+begin_quote
Create a new UTS namespace. If /file/ is specified, then the namespace
is made persistent by creating a bind mount at /file/.

#+end_quote

*-U*, *--user*[*=*/file/]

#+begin_quote
Create a new user namespace. If /file/ is specified, then the namespace
is made persistent by creating a bind mount at /file/.

#+end_quote

*-C*, *--cgroup*[*=*/file/]

#+begin_quote
Create a new cgroup namespace. If /file/ is specified, then the
namespace is made persistent by creating a bind mount at /file/.

#+end_quote

*-T*, *--time*[*=*/file/]

#+begin_quote
Create a new time namespace. If /file/ is specified, then the namespace
is made persistent by creating a bind mount at /file/. The *--monotonic*
and *--boottime* options can be used to specify the corresponding offset
in the time namespace.

#+end_quote

*-f*, *--fork*

#+begin_quote
Fork the specified /program/ as a child process of *unshare* rather than
running it directly. This is useful when creating a new PID namespace.
Note that when *unshare* is waiting for the child process, then it
ignores *SIGINT* and *SIGTERM* and does not forward any signals to the
child. It is necessary to send signals to the child process.

#+end_quote

*--keep-caps*

#+begin_quote
When the *--user* option is given, ensure that capabilities granted in
the user namespace are preserved in the child process.

#+end_quote

*--kill-child*[*=*/signame/]

#+begin_quote
When *unshare* terminates, have /signame/ be sent to the forked child
process. Combined with *--pid* this allows for an easy and reliable
killing of the entire process tree below *unshare*. If not given,
/signame/ defaults to *SIGKILL*. This option implies *--fork*.

#+end_quote

*--mount-proc*[*=*/mountpoint/]

#+begin_quote
Just before running the program, mount the proc filesystem at
/mountpoint/ (default is //proc/). This is useful when creating a new
PID namespace. It also implies creating a new mount namespace since the
//proc/ mount would otherwise mess up existing programs on the system.
The new proc filesystem is explicitly mounted as private (with
*MS_PRIVATE*|*MS_REC*).

#+end_quote

*--map-user=*/uid|name/

#+begin_quote
Run the program only after the current effective user ID has been mapped
to /uid/. If this option is specified multiple times, the last
occurrence takes precedence. This option implies *--user*.

#+end_quote

*--map-users=*/inneruid:outeruid:count/|*auto*

#+begin_quote
Run the program only after the block of user IDs of size /count/
beginning at /outeruid/ has been mapped to the block of user IDs
beginning at /inneruid/. This mapping is created with *newuidmap*(1). If
the range of user IDs overlaps with the mapping specified by
*--map-user*, then a "hole" will be removed from the mapping. This may
result in the highest user ID of the mapping not being mapped. The
special value *auto* will map the first block of user IDs owned by the
effective user from //etc/subuid/ to a block starting at user ID 0. If
this option is specified multiple times, the last occurrence takes
precedence. This option implies *--user*.

Before util-linux version 2.39, this option expected a comma-separated
argument of the form /outeruid,inneruid,count/ but that format is now
deprecated for consistency with the ordering used in
//proc/[pid]/uid_map/ and the /X-mount.idmap/ mount option.

#+end_quote

*--map-group=*/gid|name/

#+begin_quote
Run the program only after the current effective group ID has been
mapped to /gid/. If this option is specified multiple times, the last
occurrence takes precedence. This option implies *--setgroups=deny* and
*--user*.

#+end_quote

*--map-groups=*/innergid:outergid:count/|*auto*

#+begin_quote
Run the program only after the block of group IDs of size /count/
beginning at /outergid/ has been mapped to the block of group IDs
beginning at /innergid/. This mapping is created with *newgidmap*(1). If
the range of group IDs overlaps with the mapping specified by
*--map-group*, then a "hole" will be removed from the mapping. This may
result in the highest group ID of the mapping not being mapped. The
special value *auto* will map the first block of user IDs owned by the
effective user from //etc/subgid/ to a block starting at group ID 0. If
this option is specified multiple times, the last occurrence takes
precedence. This option implies *--user*.

Before util-linux version 2.39, this option expected a comma-separated
argument of the form /outergid,innergid,count/ but that format is now
deprecated for consistency with the ordering used in
//proc/[pid]/gid_map/ and the /X-mount.idmap/ mount option.

#+end_quote

*--map-auto*

#+begin_quote
Map the first block of user IDs owned by the effective user from
//etc/subuid/ to a block starting at user ID 0. In the same manner, also
map the first block of group IDs owned by the effective group from
//etc/subgid/ to a block starting at group ID 0. This option is intended
to handle the common case where the first block of subordinate user and
group IDs can map the whole user and group ID space. This option is
equivalent to specifying *--map-users=auto* and *--map-groups=auto*.

#+end_quote

*-r*, *--map-root-user*

#+begin_quote
Run the program only after the current effective user and group IDs have
been mapped to the superuser UID and GID in the newly created user
namespace. This makes it possible to conveniently gain capabilities
needed to manage various aspects of the newly created namespaces (such
as configuring interfaces in the network namespace or mounting
filesystems in the mount namespace) even when run unprivileged. As a
mere convenience feature, it does not support more sophisticated use
cases, such as mapping multiple ranges of UIDs and GIDs. This option
implies *--setgroups=deny* and *--user*. This option is equivalent to
*--map-user=0 --map-group=0*.

#+end_quote

*-c*, *--map-current-user*

#+begin_quote
Run the program only after the current effective user and group IDs have
been mapped to the same UID and GID in the newly created user namespace.
This option implies *--setgroups=deny* and *--user*. This option is
equivalent to *--map-user=$(id -ru) --map-group=$(id -rg)*.

#+end_quote

*--propagation private*|*shared*|*slave*|*unchanged*

#+begin_quote
Recursively set the mount propagation flag in the new mount namespace.
The default is to set the propagation to /private/. It is possible to
disable this feature with the argument *unchanged*. The option is
silently ignored when the mount namespace (*--mount*) is not requested.

#+end_quote

*--setgroups allow*|*deny*

#+begin_quote
Allow or deny the *setgroups*(2) system call in a user namespace.

To be able to call *setgroups*(2), the calling process must at least
have *CAP_SETGID*. But since Linux 3.19 a further restriction applies:
the kernel gives permission to call *setgroups*(2) only after the GID
map (*/proc/*/pid/*/gid_map*) has been set. The GID map is writable by
root when *setgroups*(2) is enabled (i.e., *allow*, the default), and
the GID map becomes writable by unprivileged processes when
*setgroups*(2) is permanently disabled (with *deny*).

#+end_quote

*-R*, *--root=*/dir/

#+begin_quote
run the command with root directory set to /dir/.

#+end_quote

*-w*, *--wd=*/dir/

#+begin_quote
change working directory to /dir/.

#+end_quote

*-S*, *--setuid* /uid/

#+begin_quote
Set the user ID which will be used in the entered namespace.

#+end_quote

*-G*, *--setgid* /gid/

#+begin_quote
Set the group ID which will be used in the entered namespace and drop
supplementary groups.

#+end_quote

*--monotonic* /offset/

#+begin_quote
Set the offset of *CLOCK_MONOTONIC* which will be used in the entered
time namespace. This option requires unsharing a time namespace with
*--time*.

#+end_quote

*--boottime* /offset/

#+begin_quote
Set the offset of *CLOCK_BOOTTIME* which will be used in the entered
time namespace. This option requires unsharing a time namespace with
*--time*.

#+end_quote

*-h*, *--help*

#+begin_quote
Display help text and exit.

#+end_quote

*-V*, *--version*

#+begin_quote
Print version and exit.

#+end_quote

* NOTES
The proc and sysfs filesystems mounting as root in a user namespace have
to be restricted so that a less privileged user cannot get more access
to sensitive files that a more privileged user made unavailable. In
short the rule for proc and sysfs is as close to a bind mount as
possible.

* EXAMPLES
The following command creates a PID namespace, using *--fork* to ensure
that the executed command is performed in a child process that (being
the first process in the namespace) has PID 1. The *--mount-proc* option
ensures that a new mount namespace is also simultaneously created and
that a new *proc*(5) filesystem is mounted that contains information
corresponding to the new PID namespace. When the *readlink*(1) command
terminates, the new namespaces are automatically torn down.

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
# unshare --fork --pid --mount-proc readlink /proc/self
1
#+end_example

#+end_quote

As an unprivileged user, create a new user namespace where the user's
credentials are mapped to the root IDs inside the namespace:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ id -u; id -g
1000
1000
$ unshare --user --map-root-user \
        sh -c whoami; cat /proc/self/uid_map /proc/self/gid_map
root
         0       1000          1
         0       1000          1
#+end_example

#+end_quote

As an unprivileged user, create a user namespace where the first 65536
IDs are all mapped, and the user's credentials are mapped to the root
IDs inside the namespace. The map is determined by the subordinate IDs
assigned in *subuid*(5) and *subgid*(5). Demonstrate this mapping by
creating a file with user ID 1 and group ID 1. For brevity, only the
user ID mappings are shown:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ id -u
1000
$ cat /etc/subuid
1000:100000:65536
$ unshare --user --map-auto --map-root-user
# id -u
0
# cat /proc/self/uid_map
         0       1000          1
         1     100000      65535
# touch file; chown 1:1 file
# ls -ln --time-style=+ file
-rw-r--r-- 1 1 1 0  file
# exit
$ ls -ln --time-style=+ file
-rw-r--r-- 1 100000 100000 0  file
#+end_example

#+end_quote

The first of the following commands creates a new persistent UTS
namespace and modifies the hostname as seen in that namespace. The
namespace is then entered with *nsenter*(1) in order to display the
modified hostname; this step demonstrates that the UTS namespace
continues to exist even though the namespace had no member processes
after the *unshare* command terminated. The namespace is then destroyed
by removing the bind mount.

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
# touch /root/uts-ns
# unshare --uts=/root/uts-ns hostname FOO
# nsenter --uts=/root/uts-ns hostname
FOO
# umount /root/uts-ns
#+end_example

#+end_quote

The following commands establish a persistent mount namespace referenced
by the bind mount //root/namespaces/mnt/. In order to ensure that the
creation of that bind mount succeeds, the parent directory
(//root/namespaces/) is made a bind mount whose propagation type is not
*shared*.

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
# mount --bind /root/namespaces /root/namespaces
# mount --make-private /root/namespaces
# touch /root/namespaces/mnt
# unshare --mount=/root/namespaces/mnt
#+end_example

#+end_quote

The following commands demonstrate the use of the *--kill-child* option
when creating a PID namespace, in order to ensure that when *unshare* is
killed, all of the processes within the PID namespace are killed.

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
# set +m                # Dont print job status messages

# unshare --pid --fork --mount-proc --kill-child -- \
       bash --norc -c (sleep 555 &) && (ps a &) && sleep 999 &
[1] 53456
#     PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
      1 pts/3    S+     0:00 sleep 999
      3 pts/3    S+     0:00 sleep 555
      5 pts/3    R+     0:00 ps a

# ps h -o comm $!     # Show that background job is unshare(1)
unshare
# kill $!               # Kill unshare(1)
# pidof sleep
#+end_example

#+end_quote

The *pidof*(1) command prints no output, because the *sleep* processes
have been killed. More precisely, when the *sleep* process that has PID
1 in the namespace (i.e., the namespace's init process) was killed, this
caused all other processes in the namespace to be killed. By contrast, a
similar series of commands where the *--kill-child* option is not used
shows that when *unshare* terminates, the processes in the PID namespace
are not killed:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
# unshare --pid --fork --mount-proc -- \
       bash --norc -c (sleep 555 &) && (ps a &) && sleep 999 &
[1] 53479
#     PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
      1 pts/3    S+     0:00 sleep 999
      3 pts/3    S+     0:00 sleep 555
      5 pts/3    R+     0:00 ps a

# kill $!
# pidof sleep
53482 53480
#+end_example

#+end_quote

The following example demonstrates the creation of a time namespace
where the boottime clock is set to a point several years in the past:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
# uptime -p             # Show uptime in initial time namespace
up 21 hours, 30 minutes
# unshare --time --fork --boottime 300000000 uptime -p
up 9 years, 28 weeks, 1 day, 2 hours, 50 minutes
#+end_example

#+end_quote
