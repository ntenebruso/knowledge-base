#+TITLE: Manpages - flatpak-pin.1
* NAME
flatpak-pin - Pin runtimes to prevent automatic removal

* SYNOPSIS
*flatpak pin* [OPTION...] PATTERN...

* DESCRIPTION
Flatpak maintains a list of patterns that define which refs are pinned.
A pinned ref will never be automatically uninstalled (as are unused
runtimes periodically). This can be useful if for example you are using
a runtime for development purposes.

Runtimes that are explicitly installed, rather than installed as a
dependency of something else, are automatically pinned.

The patterns are just a partial ref, with the * character matching
anything within that part of the ref. Only runtimes can be pinned, not
apps. Here are some example patterns:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
org.some.Runtime
org.some.Runtime//unstable
runtime/org.domain.*
org.some.Runtime/arm
#+end_example

#+end_quote

To list the current set of pins, run this command without any patterns.

* OPTIONS
The following options are understood:

*-h*, *--help*

#+begin_quote
Show help options and exit.

#+end_quote

*--remove*

#+begin_quote
Instead of adding the patterns, remove matching patterns.

#+end_quote

*-u*, *--user*

#+begin_quote
Pin refs in a per-user installation.

#+end_quote

*--system*

#+begin_quote
Pin refs in the default system-wide installation.

#+end_quote

*--installation=NAME*

#+begin_quote
Pin refs in a system-wide installation specified by NAME among those
defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using *--installation=default*
is equivalent to using *--system*.

#+end_quote

*-v*, *--verbose*

#+begin_quote
Print debug information during command processing.

#+end_quote
