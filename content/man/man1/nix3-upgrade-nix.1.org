* Name
=nix upgrade-nix= - upgrade Nix to the latest stable version

* Synopsis
=nix upgrade-nix= [/option/...]

* Examples
- Upgrade Nix to the stable version declared in Nixpkgs:

#+begin_example
# nix upgrade-nix
#+end_example

- Upgrade Nix in a specific profile:

#+begin_example
# nix upgrade-nix --profile ~alice/.local/state/nix/profiles/profile
#+end_example

* Description
This command upgrades Nix to the stable version.

By default, the latest stable version is defined by Nixpkgs, in
*nix-fallback-paths.nix* and updated manually. It may not always be the
latest tagged release.

By default, it locates the directory containing the =nix= binary in the
=$PATH= environment variable. If that directory is a Nix profile, it
will upgrade the =nix= package in that profile to the latest stable
binary release.

You cannot use this command to upgrade Nix in the system profile of a
NixOS system (that is, if =nix= is found in =/run/current-system=).
