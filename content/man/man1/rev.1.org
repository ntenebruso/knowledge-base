#+TITLE: Manpages - rev.1
* NAME
rev - reverse lines characterwise

* SYNOPSIS
*rev* [option] [/file/...]

* DESCRIPTION
The *rev* utility copies the specified files to standard output,
reversing the order of characters in every line. If no files are
specified, standard input is read.

This utility is a line-oriented tool and it uses in-memory allocated
buffer for a whole wide-char line. If the input file is huge and without
line breaks then allocating the memory for the file may be unsuccessful.
