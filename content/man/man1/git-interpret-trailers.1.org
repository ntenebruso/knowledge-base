#+TITLE: Manpages - git-interpret-trailers.1
* NAME
git-interpret-trailers - Add or parse structured information in commit
messages

* SYNOPSIS
#+begin_example
git interpret-trailers [--in-place] [--trim-empty]
                        [(--trailer (<key>|<key-alias>)[(=|:)<value>])...]
                        [--parse] [<file>...]
#+end_example

* DESCRIPTION
Add or parse /trailer/ lines that look similar to RFC 822 e-mail
headers, at the end of the otherwise free-form part of a commit message.
For example, in the following commit message

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
subject

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Signed-off-by: Alice <alice@example.com>
Signed-off-by: Bob <bob@example.com>
#+end_example

#+end_quote

the last two lines starting with "Signed-off-by" are trailers.

This command reads commit messages from either the <file> arguments or
the standard input if no <file> is specified. If *--parse* is specified,
the output consists of the parsed trailers coming from the input,
without influencing them with any command line options or configuration
variables.

Otherwise, this command applies *trailer.** configuration variables
(which could potentially add new trailers, as well as reposition them),
as well as any command line arguments that can override configuration
variables (such as *--trailer=...* which could also add new trailers),
to each input file. The result is emitted on the standard output.

This command can also operate on the output of *git-format-patch*(1),
which is more elaborate than a plain commit message. Namely, such output
includes a commit message (as above), a "---" divider line, and a patch
part. For these inputs, the divider and patch parts are not modified by
this command and are emitted as is on the output, unless *--no-divider*
is specified.

Some configuration variables control the way the *--trailer* arguments
are applied to each input and the way any existing trailer in the input
is changed. They also make it possible to automatically add some
trailers.

By default, a /<key>=<value>/ or /<key>:<value>/ argument given using
*--trailer* will be appended after the existing trailers only if the
last trailer has a different (<key>, <value>) pair (or if there is no
existing trailer). The <key> and <value> parts will be trimmed to remove
starting and trailing whitespace, and the resulting trimmed <key> and
<value> will appear in the output like this:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
key: value
#+end_example

#+end_quote

This means that the trimmed <key> and <value> will be separated by *: *
(one colon followed by one space).

For convenience, a <key-alias> can be configured to make using
*--trailer* shorter to type on the command line. This can be configured
using the /trailer.<key-alias>.key/ configuration variable. The
<keyAlias> must be a prefix of the full <key> string, although case
sensitivity does not matter. For example, if you have

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
trailer.sign.key "Signed-off-by: "
#+end_example

#+end_quote

in your configuration, you only need to specify *--trailer="sign: foo"*
on the command line instead of *--trailer="Signed-off-by: foo"*.

By default the new trailer will appear at the end of all the existing
trailers. If there is no existing trailer, the new trailer will appear
at the end of the input. A blank line will be added before the new
trailer if there isn't one already.

Existing trailers are extracted from the input by looking for a group of
one or more lines that (i) is all trailers, or (ii) contains at least
one Git-generated or user-configured trailer and consists of at least
25% trailers. The group must be preceded by one or more empty (or
whitespace-only) lines. The group must either be at the end of the input
or be the last non-whitespace lines before a line that starts with /---/
(followed by a space or the end of the line).

When reading trailers, there can be no whitespace before or inside the
<key>, but any number of regular space and tab characters are allowed
between the <key> and the separator. There can be whitespaces before,
inside or after the <value>. The <value> may be split over multiple
lines with each subsequent line starting with at least one whitespace,
like the "folding" in RFC 822. Example:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
key: This is a very long value, with spaces and
  newlines in it.
#+end_example

#+end_quote

Note that trailers do not follow (nor are they intended to follow) many
of the rules for RFC 822 headers. For example they do not follow the
encoding rule.

* OPTIONS
--in-place

#+begin_quote
Edit the files in place.

#+end_quote

--trim-empty

#+begin_quote
If the <value> part of any trailer contains only whitespace, the whole
trailer will be removed from the output. This applies to existing
trailers as well as new trailers.

#+end_quote

--trailer <key>[(=|:)<value>]

#+begin_quote
Specify a (<key>, <value>) pair that should be applied as a trailer to
the inputs. See the description of this command.

#+end_quote

--where <placement>, --no-where

#+begin_quote
Specify where all new trailers will be added. A setting provided with
/--where/ overrides the *trailer.where* and any applicable
*trailer.<keyAlias>.where* configuration variables and applies to all
/--trailer/ options until the next occurrence of /--where/ or
/--no-where/. Upon encountering /--no-where/, clear the effect of any
previous use of /--where/, such that the relevant configuration
variables are no longer overridden. Possible placements are *after*,
*before*, *end* or *start*.

#+end_quote

--if-exists <action>, --no-if-exists

#+begin_quote
Specify what action will be performed when there is already at least one
trailer with the same <key> in the input. A setting provided with
/--if-exists/ overrides the *trailer.ifExists* and any applicable
*trailer.<keyAlias>.ifExists* configuration variables and applies to all
/--trailer/ options until the next occurrence of /--if-exists/ or
/--no-if-exists/. Upon encountering --no-if-exists, clear the effect of
any previous use of --if-exists, such that the relevant configuration
variables are no longer overridden. Possible actions are
*addIfDifferent*, *addIfDifferentNeighbor*, *add*, *replace* and
*doNothing*.

#+end_quote

--if-missing <action>, --no-if-missing

#+begin_quote
Specify what action will be performed when there is no other trailer
with the same <key> in the input. A setting provided with /--if-missing/
overrides the *trailer.ifMissing* and any applicable
*trailer.<keyAlias>.ifMissing* configuration variables and applies to
all /--trailer/ options until the next occurrence of /--if-missing/ or
/--no-if-missing/. Upon encountering --no-if-missing, clear the effect
of any previous use of --if-missing, such that the relevant
configuration variables are no longer overridden. Possible actions are
*doNothing* or *add*.

#+end_quote

--only-trailers

#+begin_quote
Output only the trailers, not any other parts of the input.

#+end_quote

--only-input

#+begin_quote
Output only trailers that exist in the input; do not add any from the
command-line or by applying *trailer.** configuration variables.

#+end_quote

--unfold

#+begin_quote
If a trailer has a value that runs over multiple lines (aka "folded"),
reformat the value into a single line.

#+end_quote

--parse

#+begin_quote
A convenience alias for *--only-trailers --only-input --unfold*. This
makes it easier to only see the trailers coming from the input without
influencing them with any command line options or configuration
variables, while also making the output machine-friendly with --unfold.

#+end_quote

--no-divider

#+begin_quote
Do not treat *---* as the end of the commit message. Use this when you
know your input contains just the commit message itself (and not an
email or the output of *git format-patch*).

#+end_quote

* CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
trailer.separators

#+begin_quote
This option tells which characters are recognized as trailer separators.
By default only /:/ is recognized as a trailer separator, except that
/=/ is always accepted on the command line for compatibility with other
git commands.

The first character given by this option will be the default character
used when another separator is not specified in the config for this
trailer.

For example, if the value for this option is "%=$", then only lines
using the format /<key><sep><value>/ with <sep> containing /%/, /=/ or
/$/ and then spaces will be considered trailers. And /%/ will be the
default separator used, so by default trailers will appear like: /<key>%
<value>/ (one percent sign and one space will appear between the key and
the value).

#+end_quote

trailer.where

#+begin_quote
This option tells where a new trailer will be added.

This can be *end*, which is the default, *start*, *after* or *before*.

If it is *end*, then each new trailer will appear at the end of the
existing trailers.

If it is *start*, then each new trailer will appear at the start,
instead of the end, of the existing trailers.

If it is *after*, then each new trailer will appear just after the last
trailer with the same <key>.

If it is *before*, then each new trailer will appear just before the
first trailer with the same <key>.

#+end_quote

trailer.ifexists

#+begin_quote
This option makes it possible to choose what action will be performed
when there is already at least one trailer with the same <key> in the
input.

The valid values for this option are: *addIfDifferentNeighbor* (this is
the default), *addIfDifferent*, *add*, *replace* or *doNothing*.

With *addIfDifferentNeighbor*, a new trailer will be added only if no
trailer with the same (<key>, <value>) pair is above or below the line
where the new trailer will be added.

With *addIfDifferent*, a new trailer will be added only if no trailer
with the same (<key>, <value>) pair is already in the input.

With *add*, a new trailer will be added, even if some trailers with the
same (<key>, <value>) pair are already in the input.

With *replace*, an existing trailer with the same <key> will be deleted
and the new trailer will be added. The deleted trailer will be the
closest one (with the same <key>) to the place where the new one will be
added.

With *doNothing*, nothing will be done; that is no new trailer will be
added if there is already one with the same <key> in the input.

#+end_quote

trailer.ifmissing

#+begin_quote
This option makes it possible to choose what action will be performed
when there is not yet any trailer with the same <key> in the input.

The valid values for this option are: *add* (this is the default) and
*doNothing*.

With *add*, a new trailer will be added.

With *doNothing*, nothing will be done.

#+end_quote

trailer.<keyAlias>.key

#+begin_quote
Defines a <keyAlias> for the <key>. The <keyAlias> must be a prefix
(case does not matter) of the <key>. For example, in *git config
trailer.ack.key "Acked-by"* the "Acked-by" is the <key> and the "ack" is
the <keyAlias>. This configuration allows the shorter *--trailer
"ack:..."* invocation on the command line using the "ack" <keyAlias>
instead of the longer *--trailer "Acked-by:..."*.

At the end of the <key>, a separator can appear and then some space
characters. By default the only valid separator is /:/, but this can be
changed using the *trailer.separators* config variable.

If there is a separator in the key, then it overrides the default
separator when adding the trailer.

#+end_quote

trailer.<keyAlias>.where

#+begin_quote
This option takes the same values as the /trailer.where/ configuration
variable and it overrides what is specified by that option for trailers
with the specified <keyAlias>.

#+end_quote

trailer.<keyAlias>.ifexists

#+begin_quote
This option takes the same values as the /trailer.ifexists/
configuration variable and it overrides what is specified by that option
for trailers with the specified <keyAlias>.

#+end_quote

trailer.<keyAlias>.ifmissing

#+begin_quote
This option takes the same values as the /trailer.ifmissing/
configuration variable and it overrides what is specified by that option
for trailers with the specified <keyAlias>.

#+end_quote

trailer.<keyAlias>.command

#+begin_quote
Deprecated in favor of /trailer.<keyAlias>.cmd/. This option behaves in
the same way as /trailer.<keyAlias>.cmd/, except that it doesn't pass
anything as argument to the specified command. Instead the first
occurrence of substring $ARG is replaced by the <value> that would be
passed as argument.

Note that $ARG in the user's command is only replaced once and that the
original way of replacing $ARG is not safe.

When both /trailer.<keyAlias>.cmd/ and /trailer.<keyAlias>.command/ are
given for the same <keyAlias>, /trailer.<keyAlias>.cmd/ is used and
/trailer.<keyAlias>.command/ is ignored.

#+end_quote

trailer.<keyAlias>.cmd

#+begin_quote
This option can be used to specify a shell command that will be called
once to automatically add a trailer with the specified <keyAlias>, and
then called each time a /--trailer <keyAlias>=<value>/ argument is
specified to modify the <value> of the trailer that this option would
produce.

When the specified command is first called to add a trailer with the
specified <keyAlias>, the behavior is as if a special /--trailer
<keyAlias>=<value>/ argument was added at the beginning of the "git
interpret-trailers" command, where <value> is taken to be the standard
output of the command with any leading and trailing whitespace trimmed
off.

If some /--trailer <keyAlias>=<value>/ arguments are also passed on the
command line, the command is called again once for each of these
arguments with the same <keyAlias>. And the <value> part of these
arguments, if any, will be passed to the command as its first argument.
This way the command can produce a <value> computed from the <value>
passed in the /--trailer <keyAlias>=<value>/ argument.
