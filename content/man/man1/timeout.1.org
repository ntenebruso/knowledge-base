#+TITLE: Manpages - timeout.1
* NAME
timeout - run a command with a time limit

* SYNOPSIS
*timeout* [/OPTION/] /DURATION COMMAND /[/ARG/]...\\
*timeout* [/OPTION/]

* DESCRIPTION
Start COMMAND, and kill it if still running after DURATION.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

*--preserve-status*

#+begin_quote
exit with the same status as COMMAND, even when the

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
command times out

#+end_quote

*--foreground*

#+begin_quote
when not running timeout directly from a shell prompt,

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
allow COMMAND to read from the TTY and get TTY signals; in this mode,
children of COMMAND will not be timed out

#+end_quote

*-k*, *--kill-after*=/DURATION/

#+begin_quote
also send a KILL signal if COMMAND is still running

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
this long after the initial signal was sent

#+end_quote

*-s*, *--signal*=/SIGNAL/

#+begin_quote
specify the signal to be sent on timeout;

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
SIGNAL may be a name like 'HUP' or a number; see 'kill *-l*' for a list
of signals

#+end_quote

- *-v*, *--verbose* :: diagnose to stderr any signal sent upon timeout

- *--help* :: display this help and exit

- *--version* :: output version information and exit

DURATION is a floating point number with an optional suffix: 's' for
seconds (the default), 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd' for days. A
duration of 0 disables the associated timeout.

Upon timeout, send the TERM signal to COMMAND, if no other SIGNAL
specified. The TERM signal kills any process that does not block or
catch that signal. It may be necessary to use the KILL signal, since
this signal can't be caught.

** Exit status:
- 124 :: if COMMAND times out, and *--preserve-status* is not specified

- 125 :: if the timeout command itself fails

- 126 :: if COMMAND is found but cannot be invoked

- 127 :: if COMMAND cannot be found

- 137 :: if COMMAND (or timeout itself) is sent the KILL (9) signal
  (128+9)

- - :: the exit status of COMMAND otherwise

* BUGS
Some platforms don't currently support timeouts beyond the year 2038.
