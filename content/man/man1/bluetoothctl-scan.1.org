#+TITLE: Manpages - bluetoothctl-scan.1
* NAME
bluetoothctl-scan - Scan Submenu

* SYNOPSIS
*bluetoothctl* [--options] [scan.commands]

* SCAN COMMANDS
** uuids
Set/Get UUIDs filter.

#+begin_quote
- *Usage* :: *# uuids [all/uuid1 uuid2 ...]*

#+end_quote

** rssi
Set/Get RSSI filter, and clears pathloss.

This sets the minimum rssi value for reporting device advertisements.

The value is in dBm.

If one or more discovery filters have been set, the RSSI delta-threshold
imposed by starting discovery by default will not be applied.

#+begin_quote
- *Usage* :: *# rssi [rssi]*

- *Example* :: *# rssi -60*

#+end_quote

** pathloss
Set/Get Pathloss filter, and clears RSSI.

This sets the maximum pathloss value for reporting device
advertisements.

The value is in dB.

If one or more discovery filters have been set, the RSSI delta-threshold
imposed by starting discovery by default will not be applied.

#+begin_quote
- *Usage* :: *# pathloss [pathloss]*

- *Example* :: *# pathloss 4*

#+end_quote

** transport
Set/Get transport filter.

Transport parameter determines the type of scan.

The default is auto.

Possible values:

#+begin_quote
- "auto": interleaved scan

- "bredr": BR/EDR inquiry

- "le": LE scan only

#+end_quote

If "le" or "bredr" Transport is requested and the controller doesn't
support it, an org.bluez.Error.Failed error will be returned.

If "auto" transport is requested, the scan will use LE, BREDR, or both,
depending on what's currently enabled on the controller.

#+begin_quote
- *Usage* :: *# transport [auto/bredr/le]*

#+end_quote

** duplicate-data
Set/Get duplicate data filter.

Disables duplicate detection of advertisement data.

When enabled, PropertiesChanged signals will be generated for
ManufacturerData and ServiceData every time they are discovered.

#+begin_quote
- *Usage* :: *# duplicate-data [on/off]*

#+end_quote

** discoverable
Set/Get discoverable filter.

Makes the adapter discoverable while discovering.

If the adapter is already discoverable, setting this filter won't have
any effect.

#+begin_quote
- *Usage* :: *# discoverable [on/off]*

#+end_quote

** pattern
Set/Get pattern filter.

Discover devices where the pattern matches either the prefix of the
address or the device name, which is a convenient way to limit the
number of device objects created during a discovery.

When set, it disregards device discoverable flags.

#+begin_quote
- *Note* :: The pattern matching is ignored if there are other clients
  that don't set any pattern, as it works as a logical OR. Also, setting
  an empty string "" pattern will match any device found.

- *Usage* :: *# pattern [value]*

#+end_quote

** clear
Clears discovery filter.

#+begin_quote
- *Usage* :: *# clear
  [uuids/rssi/pathloss/transport/duplicate-data/discoverable/pattern]*

#+end_quote
