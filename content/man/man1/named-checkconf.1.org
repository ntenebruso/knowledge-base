#+TITLE: Manpages - named-checkconf.1
* NAME
named-checkconf - named configuration file syntax checking tool

* SYNOPSIS
*named-checkconf* [*-chjlvz*] [*-p* [*-x* ]] [*-t* directory] {filename}

* DESCRIPTION
*named-checkconf* checks the syntax, but not the semantics, of a /named/
configuration file. The file, along with all files included by it, is
parsed and checked for syntax errors. If no file is specified,
*/nix/store/m0lwghj9czw5pvpxyji593ns7df0gn25-bind-9.18.28/etc/named.conf*
is read by default.

Note: files that /named/ reads in separate parser contexts, such as
*rndc.key* and *bind.keys*, are not automatically read by
*named-checkconf*. Configuration errors in these files may cause /named/
to fail to run, even if *named-checkconf* was successful. However,
*named-checkconf* can be run on these files explicitly.

* OPTIONS

#+begin_quote
- *-h* :: This option prints the usage summary and exits.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-j* :: When loading a zonefile, this option instructs /named/ to read
  the journal if it exists.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-l* :: This option lists all the configured zones. Each line of
  output contains the zone name, class (e.g. IN), view, and type (e.g.
  primary or secondary).

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-c* :: This option specifies that only the "core" configuration
  should be checked. This suppresses the loading of plugin modules, and
  causes all parameters to *plugin* statements to be ignored.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-i* :: This option ignores warnings on deprecated options.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-p* :: This option prints out the /named.conf/ and included files in
  canonical form if no errors were detected. See also the /-x/ option.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-t directory* :: This option instructs /named/ to chroot to
  *directory*, so that *include* directives in the configuration file
  are processed as if run by a similarly chrooted /named/.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-v* :: This option prints the version of the *named-checkconf*
  program and exits.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-x* :: When printing the configuration files in canonical form, this
  option obscures shared secrets by replacing them with strings of
  question marks (*?*). This allows the contents of /named.conf/ and
  related files to be shared - for example, when submitting bug
  reports - without compromising private data. This option cannot be
  used without /-p/.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-z* :: This option performs a test load of all zones of type
  *primary* found in /named.conf/.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *filename* :: This indicates the name of the configuration file to be
  checked. If not specified, it defaults to
  */nix/store/m0lwghj9czw5pvpxyji593ns7df0gn25-bind-9.18.28/etc/named.conf*.

#+end_quote

* RETURN VALUES
*named-checkconf* returns an exit status of 1 if errors were detected
and 0 otherwise.
