* NAME
dnssec-dsfromkey - DNSSEC DS RR generation tool

* SYNOPSIS
*dnssec-dsfromkey* [ *-1* | *-2* | *-a* alg ] [ *-C* ] [*-T* TTL] [*-v*
level] [*-K* directory] {keyfile}

*dnssec-dsfromkey* [ *-1* | *-2* | *-a* alg ] [ *-C* ] [*-T* TTL] [*-v*
level] [*-c* class] [*-A*] {*-f* file} [dnsname]

*dnssec-dsfromkey* [ *-1* | *-2* | *-a* alg ] [ *-C* ] [*-T* TTL] [*-v*
level] [*-c* class] [*-K* directory] {*-s*} {dnsname}

*dnssec-dsfromkey* [ *-h* | *-V* ]

* DESCRIPTION
The *dnssec-dsfromkey* command outputs DS (Delegation Signer) resource
records (RRs), or CDS (Child DS) RRs with the /-C/ option.

By default, only KSKs are converted (keys with flags = 257). The /-A/
option includes ZSKs (flags = 256). Revoked keys are never included.

The input keys can be specified in a number of ways:

By default, *dnssec-dsfromkey* reads a key file named in the format
*Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key*, as generated by /dnssec-keygen/.

With the /-f file/ option, *dnssec-dsfromkey* reads keys from a zone
file or partial zone file (which can contain just the DNSKEY records).

With the /-s/ option, *dnssec-dsfromkey* reads a *keyset-* file, as
generated by /dnssec-keygen/ /-C/.

* OPTIONS

#+begin_quote
- *-1* :: This option is an abbreviation for /-a SHA1/.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-2* :: This option is an abbreviation for /-a SHA-256/.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-a algorithm* :: This option specifies a digest algorithm to use when
  converting DNSKEY records to DS records. This option can be repeated,
  so that multiple DS records are created for each DNSKEY record.

  The algorithm must be one of SHA-1, SHA-256, or SHA-384. These values
  are case-insensitive, and the hyphen may be omitted. If no algorithm
  is specified, the default is SHA-256.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-A* :: This option indicates that ZSKs are to be included when
  generating DS records. Without this option, only keys which have the
  KSK flag set are converted to DS records and printed. This option is
  only useful in /-f/ zone file mode.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-c class* :: This option specifies the DNS class; the default is IN.
  This option is only useful in /-s/ keyset or /-f/ zone file mode.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-C* :: This option generates CDS records rather than DS records.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-f file* :: This option sets zone file mode, in which the final
  dnsname argument of *dnssec-dsfromkey* is the DNS domain name of a
  zone whose master file can be read from *file*. If the zone name is
  the same as *file*, then it may be omitted.

  If *file* is *-*, then the zone data is read from the standard input.
  This makes it possible to use the output of the /dig/ command as
  input, as in:

  *dig dnskey example.com | dnssec-dsfromkey -f - example.com*

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-h* :: This option prints usage information.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-K directory* :: This option tells BIND 9 to look for key files or
  *keyset-* files in *directory*.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-s* :: This option enables keyset mode, in which the final dnsname
  argument from *dnssec-dsfromkey* is the DNS domain name used to locate
  a *keyset-* file.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-T TTL* :: This option specifies the TTL of the DS records. By
  default the TTL is omitted.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-v level* :: This option sets the debugging level.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-V* :: This option prints version information.

#+end_quote

* EXAMPLE
To build the SHA-256 DS RR from the *Kexample.com.+003+26160* keyfile,
issue the following command:

*dnssec-dsfromkey -2 Kexample.com.+003+26160*

The command returns something similar to:

*example.com. IN DS 26160 5 2
3A1EADA7A74B8D0BA86726B0C227AA85AB8BBD2B2004F41A868A54F0C5EA0B94*

* FILES
The keyfile can be designated by the key identification
*Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii* or the full file name *Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key*, as
generated by /dnssec-keygen/.

The keyset file name is built from the *directory*, the string
*keyset-*, and the *dnsname*.

* CAVEAT
A keyfile error may return "file not found," even if the file exists.
