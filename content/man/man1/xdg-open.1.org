#+TITLE: Manpages - xdg-open.1
.SH "NAME" xdg-open - opens a file or URL in the users preferred
application

.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.HP u

*xdg-open* { | /file/ | /URL/ }

.HP u

*xdg-open* { | *--help* | *--manual* | *--version* }

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP xdg-open opens a file or URL in the users preferred application. If
a URL is provided the URL will be opened in the users preferred web
browser. If a file is provided the file will be opened in the preferred
application for files of that type. xdg-open supports file, ftp, http
and https URLs.

.PP xdg-open is for use inside a desktop session only. It is not
recommended to use xdg-open as root.

.PP As xdg-open can not handle arguments that begin with a “-” it is
recommended to pass filepaths in one of the following ways:

#+begin_quote
·

Pass absolute paths, i.e. by using *realpath* as a preprocessor.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
·

Prefix known relative filepaths with a “./”. For example using sed -E
s|^[^/]|./\0|.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
·

Pass a file URL.

#+end_quote

.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP *--help*

#+begin_quote
Show command synopsis.

.RE

.PP *--manual*

#+begin_quote
Show this manual page.

.RE

.PP *--version*

#+begin_quote
Show the xdg-utils version information.

.RE .SH "EXIT CODES"

.PP An exit code of 0 indicates success while a non-zero exit code
indicates failure. The following failure codes can be returned:

.PP *1*

#+begin_quote
Error in command line syntax.

.RE .PP *2*

#+begin_quote
One of the files passed on the command line did not exist.

.RE .PP *3*

#+begin_quote
A required tool could not be found.

.RE .PP *4*

#+begin_quote
The action failed.

.RE .PP In case of success the process launched from the .desktop file
will not be forked off and therefore may result in xdg-open running for
a very long time. This behaviour intentionally differs from most desktop
specific openers to allow terminal based applications to run using the
same terminal xdg-open was called from.

.SH "REPORTING ISSUES"

.PP Please keep in mind *xdg-open* inherits most of the flaws of its
configuration and the underlying opener.

.PP In case the command xdg-mime query default "$(xdg-mime query
filetype path/to/troublesome_file)" names the program responsible for
any unexpected behaviour you can fix that by setting a different
handler. (If the program is broken let the developers know)

.PP Also see the security note on *xdg-mime*(1) for the default
subcommand.

.PP If a flaw is reproducible using the desktop specific opener (and
isnt a configuration issue): Please report to whoever is responsible for
that first (reporting to xdg-utils is better than not reporting at all,
but since the xdg-utils are maintained in very little spare time a fix
will take much longer)

.PP In case an issue specific to xdg-open please report it to
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xdg/xdg-utils/-/issues .
