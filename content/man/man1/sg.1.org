#+TITLE: Manpages - sg.1
* NAME
sg - execute command as different group ID

* SYNOPSIS
*sg* [-] [group [-c ] command]

* DESCRIPTION
The *sg* command works similar to *newgrp* but accepts a command. The
command will be executed with the /bin/sh shell. With most shells you
may run *sg* from, you need to enclose multi-word commands in quotes.
Another difference between *newgrp* and *sg* is that some shells treat
*newgrp* specially, replacing themselves with a new instance of a shell
that *newgrp* creates. This doesnt happen with *sg*, so upon exit from a
*sg* command you are returned to your previous group ID.

* CONFIGURATION

behavior of this tool:
