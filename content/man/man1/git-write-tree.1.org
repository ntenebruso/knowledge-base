#+TITLE: Manpages - git-write-tree.1
* NAME
git-write-tree - Create a tree object from the current index

* SYNOPSIS
#+begin_example
git write-tree [--missing-ok] [--prefix=<prefix>/]
#+end_example

* DESCRIPTION
Creates a tree object using the current index. The name of the new tree
object is printed to standard output.

The index must be in a fully merged state.

Conceptually, /git write-tree/ sync()s the current index contents into a
set of tree files. In order to have that match what is actually in your
directory right now, you need to have done a /git update-index/ phase
before you did the /git write-tree/.

* OPTIONS
--missing-ok

#+begin_quote
Normally /git write-tree/ ensures that the objects referenced by the
directory exist in the object database. This option disables this check.

#+end_quote

--prefix=<prefix>/

#+begin_quote
Writes a tree object that represents a subdirectory *<prefix>*. This can
be used to write the tree object for a subproject that is in the named
subdirectory.

#+end_quote

* GIT
Part of the *git*(1) suite
