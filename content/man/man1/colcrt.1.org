#+TITLE: Manpages - colcrt.1
* NAME
colcrt - filter nroff output for CRT previewing

* SYNOPSIS
*colcrt* [options] [/file/ ...]

* DESCRIPTION
*colcrt* provides virtual half-line and reverse line feed sequences for
terminals without such capability, and on which overstriking is
destructive. Half-line characters and underlining (changed to dashing
`-) are placed on new lines in between the normal output lines.

* OPTIONS
*-*, *--no-underlining*

#+begin_quote
Suppress all underlining. This option is especially useful for
previewing /allboxed/ tables from *tbl*(1).

#+end_quote

*-2*, *--half-lines*

#+begin_quote
Causes all half-lines to be printed, effectively double spacing the
output. Normally, a minimal space output format is used which will
suppress empty lines. The program never suppresses two consecutive empty
lines, however. The *-2* option is useful for sending output to the line
printer when the output contains superscripts and subscripts which would
otherwise be partially invisible.

#+end_quote

*-h*, *--help*

#+begin_quote
Display help text and exit.

#+end_quote

*-V*, *--version*

#+begin_quote
Print version and exit.

#+end_quote

* HISTORY
The *colcrt* command appeared in 3.0BSD.

* BUGS
Should fold underlines onto blanks even with the *-* option so that a
true underline character would show.

Can't back up more than 102 lines.

General overstriking is lost; as a special case | overstruck with - or
underline becomes +.

Lines are trimmed to 132 characters.

Some provision should be made for processing superscripts and subscripts
in documents which are already double-spaced.

* EXAMPLES
A typical use of *colcrt* would be:

#+begin_quote
*tbl exum2.n | nroff -ms | colcrt - | more*\\

#+end_quote
