* Name
=nix store path-from-hash-part= - get a store path from its hash part

* Synopsis
=nix store path-from-hash-part= [/option/...] /hash-part/

* Examples
- Return the full store path with the given hash part:

#+begin_example
# nix store path-from-hash-part --store https://cache.nixos.org/ 0i2jd68mp5g6h2sa5k9c85rb80sn8hi9
/nix/store/0i2jd68mp5g6h2sa5k9c85rb80sn8hi9-hello-2.10
#+end_example

* Description
Given the hash part of a store path (that is, the 32 characters
following =/nix/store/=), return the full store path. This is primarily
useful in the implementation of binary caches, where a request for a
=.narinfo= file only supplies the hash part (e.g.
=https://cache.nixos.org/0i2jd68mp5g6h2sa5k9c85rb80sn8hi9.narinfo=).

* Options
** Logging-related options
- =--debug=

  Set the logging verbosity level to â€˜debug'.

- =--log-format= /format/

  Set the format of log output; one of =raw=, =internal-json=, =bar= or
  =bar-with-logs=.

- =--print-build-logs= / =-L=

  Print full build logs on standard error.

- =--quiet=

  Decrease the logging verbosity level.

- =--verbose= / =-v=

  Increase the logging verbosity level.

** Miscellaneous global options

- =--offline=

  Disable substituters and consider all previously downloaded files
  up-to-date.

- =--option= /name/ /value/

  Set the Nix configuration setting /name/ to /value/ (overriding
  =nix.conf=).
