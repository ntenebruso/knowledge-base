#+TITLE: Manpages - dnssec-revoke.1
* NAME
dnssec-revoke - set the REVOKED bit on a DNSSEC key

* SYNOPSIS
*dnssec-revoke* [*-hr*] [*-v* level] [*-V*] [*-K* directory] [*-E*
engine] [*-f*] [*-R*] {keyfile}

* DESCRIPTION
*dnssec-revoke* reads a DNSSEC key file, sets the REVOKED bit on the key
as defined in /RFC 5011/, and creates a new pair of key files containing
the now-revoked key.

* OPTIONS

#+begin_quote
- *-h* :: This option emits a usage message and exits.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-K directory* :: This option sets the directory in which the key
  files are to reside.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-r* :: This option indicates to remove the original keyset files
  after writing the new keyset files.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-v level* :: This option sets the debugging level.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-V* :: This option prints version information.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-E engine* :: This option specifies the cryptographic hardware to
  use, when applicable.

  When BIND 9 is built with OpenSSL, this needs to be set to the OpenSSL
  engine identifier that drives the cryptographic accelerator or
  hardware service module (usually *pkcs11*).

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-f* :: This option indicates a forced overwrite and causes
  *dnssec-revoke* to write the new key pair, even if a file already
  exists matching the algorithm and key ID of the revoked key.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-R* :: This option prints the key tag of the key with the REVOKE bit
  set, but does not revoke the key.

#+end_quote
