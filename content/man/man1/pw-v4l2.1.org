#+TITLE: Manpages - pw-v4l2.1
* NAME
pw-v4l2 - Use PipeWire instead of V4L2

* SYNOPSIS
*pw-v4l2* [/options/] /COMMAND/ [/ARGUMENTS.../]

* DESCRIPTION
*pw-v4l2* runs a command using a compatibility layer that maps PipeWire
video devices to be visible to applications using V4L2.

This is implemented by preloading a shared library via LD_PRELOAD, which
translates library calls that try to access V4L2 devices.
