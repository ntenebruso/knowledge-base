#+TITLE: Manpages - flatpak-build-bundle.1
* NAME
flatpak-build-bundle - Create a single-file bundle from a local
repository

* SYNOPSIS
*flatpak build-bundle* [OPTION...] LOCATION FILENAME NAME [BRANCH]

* DESCRIPTION
Creates a single-file named FILENAME for the application (or runtime)
named NAME in the repository at LOCATION. If a BRANCH is specified, this
branch of the application is used.

The collection ID set on the repository at LOCATION (if set) will be
used for the bundle.

Unless *--oci* is used, the format of the bundle file is that of an
ostree static delta (against an empty base) with some flatpak specific
metadata for the application icons and appdata.
