* NAME
systemd-cgls - Recursively show control group contents

* SYNOPSIS

* DESCRIPTION
*systemd-cgls* recursively shows the contents of the selected Linux
control group hierarchy in a tree. If arguments are specified, shows all
member processes of the specified control groups plus all their
subgroups and their members. The control groups may either be specified
by their full file paths or are assumed in the systemd control group
hierarchy. If no argument is specified and the current working directory

contents of the control group the working directory refers to.
Otherwise, the full systemd control group hierarchy is shown.
