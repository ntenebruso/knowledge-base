* NAME
git-web--browse - Git helper script to launch a web browser

* SYNOPSIS

git web--browse [<options>] (<URL>|<file>)...

that are passed as arguments, as HTML pages in new tabs on an already
opened web browser.

Custom commands may also be specified.

* OPTIONS
-b <browser>, --browser=<browser>

#+begin_quote
Use the specified browser. It must be in the list of supported browsers.

#+end_quote

-t <browser>, --tool=<browser>

#+begin_quote
Same as above.

#+end_quote

-c <conf.var>, --config=<conf.var>

#+begin_quote
CONF.VAR is looked up in the Git config files. If it's set, then its
value specifies the browser that should be used.

#+end_quote

* CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
** CONF.VAR (from -c option) and web.browser
The web browser can be specified using a configuration variable passed
with the -c (or --config) command-line option, or the *web.browser*
configuration variable if the former is not used.

** browser.<tool>.path
You can explicitly provide a full path to your preferred browser by
setting the configuration variable *browser.<tool>.path*. For example,
you can configure the absolute path to firefox by setting
/browser.firefox.path/. Otherwise, /git web--browse/ assumes the tool is
available in PATH.

** browser.<tool>.cmd
When the browser, specified by options or configuration variables, is
not among the supported ones, then the corresponding
*browser.<tool>.cmd* configuration variable will be looked up. If this
variable exists then /git web--browse/ will treat the specified tool as
a custom command and will use a shell eval to run the command with the
URLs passed as arguments.

* NOTE ABOUT KONQUEROR
When /konqueror/ is specified by a command-line option or a
configuration variable, we launch /kfmclient/ to try to open the HTML
man page on an already opened konqueror in a new tab if possible.

For consistency, we also try such a trick if /browser.konqueror.path/ is
set to something like *A_PATH_TO/konqueror*. That means we will try to
launch *A_PATH_TO/kfmclient* instead.

If you really want to use /konqueror/, then you can use something like
the following:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
        [web]
                browser = konq

        [browser "konq"]
                cmd = A_PATH_TO/konqueror
#+end_example

#+end_quote

** Note about git-config --global
Note that these configuration variables should probably be set using the
*--global* flag, for example like this:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ git config --global web.browser firefox
#+end_example

#+end_quote

as they are probably more user specific than repository specific. See
*git-config*(1) for more information about this.
