* NAME
dnssec-verify - DNSSEC zone verification tool

* SYNOPSIS
*dnssec-verify* [*-c* class] [*-E* engine] [*-I* input-format] [*-o*
origin] [*-q*] [*-v* level] [*-V*] [*-x*] [*-z*] {zonefile}

* DESCRIPTION
*dnssec-verify* verifies that a zone is fully signed for each algorithm
found in the DNSKEY RRset for the zone, and that the NSEC/NSEC3 chains
are complete.

* OPTIONS

#+begin_quote
- *-c class* :: This option specifies the DNS class of the zone.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-E engine* :: This option specifies the cryptographic hardware to
  use, when applicable.

  When BIND 9 is built with OpenSSL, this needs to be set to the OpenSSL
  engine identifier that drives the cryptographic accelerator or
  hardware service module (usually *pkcs11*).

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-I input-format* :: This option sets the format of the input zone
  file. Possible formats are *text* (the default) and *raw*. This option
  is primarily intended to be used for dynamic signed zones, so that the
  dumped zone file in a non-text format containing updates can be
  verified independently. This option is not useful for non-dynamic
  zones.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-o origin* :: This option indicates the zone origin. If not
  specified, the name of the zone file is assumed to be the origin.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-v level* :: This option sets the debugging level.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-V* :: This option prints version information.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-q* :: This option sets quiet mode, which suppresses output. Without
  this option, when *dnssec-verify* is run it prints to standard output
  the number of keys in use, the algorithms used to verify the zone was
  signed correctly, and other status information. With this option, all
  non-error output is suppressed, and only the exit code indicates
  success.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-x* :: This option verifies only that the DNSKEY RRset is signed with
  key-signing keys. Without this flag, it is assumed that the DNSKEY
  RRset is signed by all active keys. When this flag is set, it is not
  an error if the DNSKEY RRset is not signed by zone-signing keys. This
  corresponds to the /-x option in dnssec-signzone/.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-z* :: This option indicates that the KSK flag on the keys should be
  ignored when determining whether the zone is correctly signed. Without
  this flag, it is assumed that there is a non-revoked, self-signed
  DNSKEY with the KSK flag set for each algorithm, and that RRsets other
  than DNSKEY RRset are signed with a different DNSKEY without the KSK
  flag set.

  With this flag set, BIND 9 only requires that for each algorithm,
  there be at least one non-revoked, self-signed DNSKEY, regardless of
  the KSK flag state, and that other RRsets be signed by a non-revoked
  key for the same algorithm that includes the self-signed key; the same
  key may be used for both purposes. This corresponds to the /-z option
  in dnssec-signzone/.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *zonefile* :: This option indicates the file containing the zone to be
  signed.
