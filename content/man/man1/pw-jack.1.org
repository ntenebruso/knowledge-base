#+TITLE: Manpages - pw-jack.1
* NAME
pw-jack - Use PipeWire instead of JACK

* SYNOPSIS
*pw-jack* [/options/] /COMMAND/ [/ARGUMENTS.../]

* DESCRIPTION
*pw-jack* modifies the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable so that
applications will load PipeWire's reimplementation of the JACK client
libraries instead of JACK's own libraries. This results in JACK clients
being redirected to PipeWire.

If PipeWire's reimplementation of the JACK client libraries has been
installed as a system-wide replacement for JACK's own libraries, then
the whole system already behaves in that way, in which case *pw-jack*
has no practical effect.
