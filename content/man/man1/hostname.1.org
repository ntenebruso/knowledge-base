* DESCRIPTION
*Hostname* is the program that is used to either set or display the
current host, domain or node name of the system. These names are used by
many of the networking programs to identify the machine. The domain name
is also used by NIS/YP.

** GET NAME
When called without any arguments, the program displays the current
names:

*hostname* will print the name of the system as returned by the
*gethostname*(2) function.

*domainname, nisdomainname, ypdomainname* will print the name of the
system as returned by the *getdomainname*(2) function. This is also
known as the YP/NIS domain name of the system.

*nodename* will print the DECnet node name of the system as returned by
the *getnodename*(2) function.

*dnsdomainname* will print the domain part of the FQDN (Fully Qualified
Domain Name). The complete FQDN of the system is returned with *hostname
--fqdn*.

** SET NAME
When called with one argument or with the *--file* option, the commands
set the host name, the NIS/YP domain name or the node name.

Note, that only the super-user can change the names.

It is not possible to set the FQDN or the DNS domain name with the
*dnsdomainname* command (see *THE FQDN* below).

The host name is usually set once at system startup by reading the
contents of a file which contains the host name, e.g. //etc/hostname/).

** THE FQDN
You can't change the FQDN (as returned by *hostname --fqdn*) or the DNS
domain name (as returned by *dnsdomainname*) with this command. The FQDN
of the system is the name that the *resolver*(3) returns for the host
name.

Technically: The FQDN is the canonical name returned by
*gethostbyname2*(2) when resolving the result of the *gethostname*(2)
name. The DNS domain name is the part after the first dot.

Therefore it depends on the configuration (usually in //etc/host.conf/)
how you can change it. If *hosts* is the first lookup method, you can
change the FQDN in //etc/hosts/.

* OPTIONS
- /-a, --alias/ :: Display the alias name of the host (if used).

- /-d, --domain/ :: Display the name of the DNS domain (this is the FQDN
  without the segment up to the first dot). This is equivalent to using
  the *dnsdomainname* command.

- /-F, --file filename/ :: Read the new host name from the specified
  file. Comments (lines starting with a `#') are ignored.

- /-f, --fqdn, --long/ :: Display the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain
  Name). A FQDN consists of name including the DNS domain.

- /-h, --help/ :: Print a usage message and exit.

- /-i, --ip-address/ :: Display the IP address(es) of the host.

- /-n, --node/ :: Display the DECnet node name. If a parameter is given
  (or *--file name* ) the root can also set a new node name.

- /-s, --short/ :: Display the short host name. This is the host name
  cut at the first dot.

- /-V, --version/ :: Print version information on standard output and
  exit successfully.

- /-v, --verbose/ :: Be verbose and tell what's going on.

- /-y, --yp, --nis/ :: Display the NIS domain name. If a parameter is
  given (or *--file name* ) then root can also set a new NIS domain.
