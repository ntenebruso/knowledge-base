#+TITLE: Manpages - virtfs-proxy-helper.1
* NAME
virtfs-proxy-helper - QEMU 9p virtfs proxy filesystem helper

* SYNOPSIS
*virtfs-proxy-helper* [/OPTIONS/]

* DESCRIPTION
NOTE: The 9p 'proxy' backend is deprecated (since QEMU 8.1) and will be
removed, along with this daemon, in a future version of QEMU!

Pass-through security model in QEMU 9p server needs root privilege to do
few file operations (like chown, chmod to any mode/uid:gid). There are
two issues in pass-through security model:

#+begin_quote
- TOCTTOU vulnerability: Following symbolic links in the server could
  provide access to files beyond 9p export path.

- Running QEMU with root privilege could be a security issue.

#+end_quote

To overcome above issues, following approach is used: A new filesystem
type 'proxy' is introduced. Proxy FS uses chroot + socket combination
for securing the vulnerability known with following symbolic links.
Intention of adding a new filesystem type is to allow qemu to run in
non-root mode, but doing privileged operations using socket IO.

Proxy helper (a stand alone binary part of qemu) is invoked with root
privileges. Proxy helper chroots into 9p export path and creates a
socket pair or a named socket based on the command line parameter. QEMU
and proxy helper communicate using this socket. QEMU proxy fs driver
sends filesystem request to proxy helper and receives the response from
it.

The proxy helper is designed so that it can drop root privileges except
for the capabilities needed for doing filesystem operations.

* OPTIONS
The following options are supported:

#+begin_quote
- *-h* :: Display help and exit

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-p, --path PATH* :: Path to export for proxy filesystem driver

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-f, --fd SOCKET_ID* :: Use given file descriptor as socket descriptor
  for communicating with qemu proxy fs drier. Usually a helper like
  libvirt will create socketpair and pass one of the fds as parameter to
  this option.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-s, --socket SOCKET_FILE* :: Creates named socket file for
  communicating with qemu proxy fs driver

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-u, --uid UID* :: uid to give access to named socket file; used in
  combination with -g.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-g, --gid GID* :: gid to give access to named socket file; used in
  combination with -u.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
- *-n, --nodaemon* :: Run as a normal program. By default program will
  run in daemon mode

#+end_quote
