.PP *suspend */WindowID/

#+begin_quote
Suspends the screensaver and monitor power management. /WindowID/ must

WindowID can be represented as either a decimal number or as a
hexadecimal number consisting of the prefix /0x/ followed by one or more

screensaver has been resumed in relation to each of the windows
