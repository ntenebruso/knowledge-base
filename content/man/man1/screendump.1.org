#+TITLE: Manpages - screendump.1
* NAME
screendump - dump the contents of a virtual console to stdout

* SYNOPSIS
*screendump* [ /N/ ]

* DESCRIPTION
The *screendump* command dumps the contents of virtual console *N* , (or
the current console if N is omitted) to standard out.

Just saying

#+begin_quote
cat /dev/vcsN

#+end_quote

has a similar effect.

* NOTES
For security reasons, *screendump* uses linux devices "virtual console
screen" and "virtual console screen with attributes" to give access for
screendump.

Ensure these files exist, using

#+begin_quote
cd /dev for i in 0 1 2 3 ...; do\\
mknod vcs$i c 7 $i\\
mknod vcsa$i c 7 `expr 128 + $i`\\
done

#+end_quote

(filling in the ellipses) and give the device files appropriate
permissions, or run *screendump* as root.
