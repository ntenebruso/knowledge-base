#+TITLE: Manpages - watchgnupg.1
* NAME
*watchgnupg* - Read and print logs from a socket

* SYNOPSIS
*watchgnupg* [*--force*] [*--verbose*] /socketname/

* DESCRIPTION
Most of the main utilities are able to write their log files to a Unix
Domain socket if configured that way. *watchgnupg* is a simple listener
for such a socket. It ameliorates the output with a time stamp and makes
sure that long lines are not interspersed with log output from other
utilities. This tool is not available for Windows.

*watchgnupg* is commonly invoked as

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
watchgnupg
#+end_example

#+end_quote

which is a shorthand for

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
watchgnupg --force $(gpgconf --list-dirs socketdir)/S.log
#+end_example

#+end_quote

To watch GnuPG running with a different home directory, use

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
watchgnupg --homedir DIR
#+end_example

#+end_quote

* OPTIONS
*watchgnupg* understands these options:

- *--force* :: Delete an already existing socket file. This option is
  implicitly used if no socket name has been given on the command line.

- *--homedir /DIR/* :: If no socket name is given on the command line,
  pass /DIR/ to gpgconf so that the socket for a GnuPG running with DIR
  has its home directory is used. Note that the environment variable
  /GNUPGHOME/ is ignored by watchgnupg.

- *--tcp /n/* :: Instead of reading from a local socket, listen for
  connects on TCP port /n/. A Unix domain socket can optionally also be
  given as a second source. This option does not use a default socket
  name.

- *--time-only* :: Do not print the date part of the timestamp.

- *--verbose* :: Enable extra informational output.

- *--version* :: Print version of the program and exit.

- *--help* :: Display a brief help page and exit.

* EXAMPLES

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ watchgnupg --time-only
#+end_example

#+end_quote

This waits for connections on the local socket (e.g.
‘//var/run/user/1234/gnupg/S.log/') and shows all log entries. To make
this work the option *log-file* needs to be used with all modules which
logs are to be shown. The suggested entry for the configuration files
is:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
log-file socket://
#+end_example

#+end_quote

If the default socket as given above and returned by "echo $(gpgconf
--list-dirs socketdir)/S.log" is not desired an arbitrary socket name
can be specified, for example ‘/socket:///home/foo/bar/mysocket/'. For
debugging purposes it is also possible to do remote logging. Take care
if you use this feature because the information is send in the clear
over the network. Use this syntax in the conf files:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
log-file tcp://192.168.1.1:4711
#+end_example

#+end_quote

You may use any port and not just 4711 as shown above; only IP addresses
are supported (v4 and v6) and no host names. You need to start
*watchgnupg* with the *tcp* option. Note that under Windows the registry
entry /HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:DefaultLogFile/ can be used to change the
default log output from *stderr* to whatever is given by that entry.
However the only useful entry is a TCP name for remote debugging.

The full documentation for this tool is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
If GnuPG and the info program are properly installed at your site, the
command

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
info gnupg
#+end_example

#+end_quote

should give you access to the complete manual including a menu structure
and an index.
