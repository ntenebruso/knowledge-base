#+TITLE: Manpages - git-p4.1
* NAME
git-p4 - Import from and submit to Perforce repositories

* SYNOPSIS
#+begin_example
git p4 clone [<sync-options>] [<clone-options>] <p4-depot-path>...
git p4 sync [<sync-options>] [<p4-depot-path>...]
git p4 rebase
git p4 submit [<submit-options>] [<master-branch-name>]
#+end_example

* DESCRIPTION
This command provides a way to interact with p4 repositories using Git.

Create a new Git repository from an existing p4 repository using /git p4
clone/, giving it one or more p4 depot paths. Incorporate new commits
from p4 changes with /git p4 sync/. The /sync/ command is also used to
include new branches from other p4 depot paths. Submit Git changes back
to p4 using /git p4 submit/. The command /git p4 rebase/ does a sync
plus rebases the current branch onto the updated p4 remote branch.

* EXAMPLES

#+begin_quote
·

Clone a repository:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ git p4 clone //depot/path/project
#+end_example

#+end_quote

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
·

Do some work in the newly created Git repository:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ cd project
$ vi foo.h
$ git commit -a -m "edited foo.h"
#+end_example

#+end_quote

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
·

Update the Git repository with recent changes from p4, rebasing your
work on top:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ git p4 rebase
#+end_example

#+end_quote

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
·

Submit your commits back to p4:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ git p4 submit
#+end_example

#+end_quote

#+end_quote

* COMMANDS
** Clone
Generally, /git p4 clone/ is used to create a new Git directory from an
existing p4 repository:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ git p4 clone //depot/path/project
#+end_example

#+end_quote

This:

#+begin_quote
1.

Creates an empty Git repository in a subdirectory called /project/.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
2.

Imports the full contents of the head revision from the given p4 depot
path into a single commit in the Git branch /refs/remotes/p4/master/.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
3.

Creates a local branch, /master/ from this remote and checks it out.

#+end_quote

To reproduce the entire p4 history in Git, use the /@all/ modifier on
the depot path:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ git p4 clone //depot/path/project@all
#+end_example

#+end_quote

** Sync
As development continues in the p4 repository, those changes can be
included in the Git repository using:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ git p4 sync
#+end_example

#+end_quote

This command finds new changes in p4 and imports them as Git commits.

P4 repositories can be added to an existing Git repository using /git p4
sync/ too:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ mkdir repo-git
$ cd repo-git
$ git init
$ git p4 sync //path/in/your/perforce/depot
#+end_example

#+end_quote

This imports the specified depot into /refs/remotes/p4/master/ in an
existing Git repository. The *--branch* option can be used to specify a
different branch to be used for the p4 content.

If a Git repository includes branches /refs/remotes/origin/p4/, these
will be fetched and consulted first during a /git p4 sync/. Since
importing directly from p4 is considerably slower than pulling changes
from a Git remote, this can be useful in a multi-developer environment.

If there are multiple branches, doing /git p4 sync/ will automatically
use the "BRANCH DETECTION" algorithm to try to partition new changes
into the right branch. This can be overridden with the *--branch* option
to specify just a single branch to update.

** Rebase
A common working pattern is to fetch the latest changes from the p4
depot and merge them with local uncommitted changes. Often, the p4
repository is the ultimate location for all code, thus a rebase workflow
makes sense. This command does /git p4 sync/ followed by /git rebase/ to
move local commits on top of updated p4 changes.

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ git p4 rebase
#+end_example

#+end_quote

** Submit
Submitting changes from a Git repository back to the p4 repository
requires a separate p4 client workspace. This should be specified using
the *P4CLIENT* environment variable or the Git configuration variable
/git-p4.client/. The p4 client must exist, but the client root will be
created and populated if it does not already exist.

To submit all changes that are in the current Git branch but not in the
/p4/master/ branch, use:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ git p4 submit
#+end_example

#+end_quote

To specify a branch other than the current one, use:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ git p4 submit topicbranch
#+end_example

#+end_quote

To specify a single commit or a range of commits, use:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ git p4 submit --commit <sha1>
$ git p4 submit --commit <sha1..sha1>
#+end_example

#+end_quote

The upstream reference is generally /refs/remotes/p4/master/, but can be
overridden using the *--origin=* command-line option.

The p4 changes will be created as the user invoking /git p4 submit/. The
*--preserve-user* option will cause ownership to be modified according
to the author of the Git commit. This option requires admin privileges
in p4, which can be granted using /p4 protect/.

To shelve changes instead of submitting, use *--shelve* and
*--update-shelve*:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ git p4 submit --shelve
$ git p4 submit --update-shelve 1234 --update-shelve 2345
#+end_example

#+end_quote

** Unshelve
Unshelving will take a shelved P4 changelist, and produce the equivalent
git commit in the branch refs/remotes/p4-unshelved/<changelist>.

The git commit is created relative to the current origin revision (HEAD
by default). A parent commit is created based on the origin, and then
the unshelve commit is created based on that.

The origin revision can be changed with the "--origin" option.

If the target branch in refs/remotes/p4-unshelved already exists, the
old one will be renamed.

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ git p4 sync
$ git p4 unshelve 12345
$ git show p4-unshelved/12345
<submit more changes via p4 to the same files>
$ git p4 unshelve 12345
<refuses to unshelve until git is in sync with p4 again>
#+end_example

#+end_quote

* OPTIONS
** General options
All commands except clone accept these options.

--git-dir <dir>

#+begin_quote
Set the *GIT_DIR* environment variable. See *git*(1).

#+end_quote

-v, --verbose

#+begin_quote
Provide more progress information.

#+end_quote

** Sync options
These options can be used in the initial /clone/ as well as in
subsequent /sync/ operations.

--branch <ref>

#+begin_quote
Import changes into <ref> instead of refs/remotes/p4/master. If <ref>
starts with refs/, it is used as is. Otherwise, if it does not start
with p4/, that prefix is added.

By default a <ref> not starting with refs/ is treated as the name of a
remote-tracking branch (under refs/remotes/). This behavior can be
modified using the --import-local option.

The default <ref> is "master".

This example imports a new remote "p4/proj2" into an existing Git
repository:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
    $ git init
    $ git p4 sync --branch=refs/remotes/p4/proj2 //depot/proj2
#+end_example

#+end_quote

#+end_quote

--detect-branches

#+begin_quote
Use the branch detection algorithm to find new paths in p4. It is
documented below in "BRANCH DETECTION".

#+end_quote

--changesfile <file>

#+begin_quote
Import exactly the p4 change numbers listed in /file/, one per line.
Normally, /git p4/ inspects the current p4 repository state and detects
the changes it should import.

#+end_quote

--silent

#+begin_quote
Do not print any progress information.

#+end_quote

--detect-labels

#+begin_quote
Query p4 for labels associated with the depot paths, and add them as
tags in Git. Limited usefulness as only imports labels associated with
new changelists. Deprecated.

#+end_quote

--import-labels

#+begin_quote
Import labels from p4 into Git.

#+end_quote

--import-local

#+begin_quote
By default, p4 branches are stored in /refs/remotes/p4//, where they
will be treated as remote-tracking branches by *git-branch*(1) and other
commands. This option instead puts p4 branches in /refs/heads/p4//. Note
that future sync operations must specify *--import-local* as well so
that they can find the p4 branches in refs/heads.

#+end_quote

--max-changes <n>

#+begin_quote
Import at most /n/ changes, rather than the entire range of changes
included in the given revision specifier. A typical usage would be use
/@all/ as the revision specifier, but then to use /--max-changes 1000/
to import only the last 1000 revisions rather than the entire revision
history.

#+end_quote

--changes-block-size <n>

#+begin_quote
The internal block size to use when converting a revision specifier such
as /@all/ into a list of specific change numbers. Instead of using a
single call to /p4 changes/ to find the full list of changes for the
conversion, there are a sequence of calls to /p4 changes -m/, each of
which requests one block of changes of the given size. The default block
size is 500, which should usually be suitable.

#+end_quote

--keep-path

#+begin_quote
The mapping of file names from the p4 depot path to Git, by default,
involves removing the entire depot path. With this option, the full p4
depot path is retained in Git. For example, path
///depot/main/foo/bar.c/, when imported from ///depot/main//, becomes
/foo/bar.c/. With *--keep-path*, the Git path is instead
/depot/main/foo/bar.c/.

#+end_quote

--use-client-spec

#+begin_quote
Use a client spec to find the list of interesting files in p4. See the
"CLIENT SPEC" section below.

#+end_quote

-/ <path>

#+begin_quote
Exclude selected depot paths when cloning or syncing.

#+end_quote

** Clone options
These options can be used in an initial /clone/, along with the /sync/
options described above.

--destination <directory>

#+begin_quote
Where to create the Git repository. If not provided, the last component
in the p4 depot path is used to create a new directory.

#+end_quote

--bare

#+begin_quote
Perform a bare clone. See *git-clone*(1).

#+end_quote

** Submit options
These options can be used to modify /git p4 submit/ behavior.

--origin <commit>

#+begin_quote
Upstream location from which commits are identified to submit to p4. By
default, this is the most recent p4 commit reachable from *HEAD*.

#+end_quote

-M

#+begin_quote
Detect renames. See *git-diff*(1). Renames will be represented in p4
using explicit /move/ operations. There is no corresponding option to
detect copies, but there are variables for both moves and copies.

#+end_quote

--preserve-user

#+begin_quote
Re-author p4 changes before submitting to p4. This option requires p4
admin privileges.

#+end_quote

--export-labels

#+begin_quote
Export tags from Git as p4 labels. Tags found in Git are applied to the
perforce working directory.

#+end_quote

-n, --dry-run

#+begin_quote
Show just what commits would be submitted to p4; do not change state in
Git or p4.

#+end_quote

--prepare-p4-only

#+begin_quote
Apply a commit to the p4 workspace, opening, adding and deleting files
in p4 as for a normal submit operation. Do not issue the final "p4
submit", but instead print a message about how to submit manually or
revert. This option always stops after the first (oldest) commit. Git
tags are not exported to p4.

#+end_quote

--shelve

#+begin_quote
Instead of submitting create a series of shelved changelists. After
creating each shelve, the relevant files are reverted/deleted. If you
have multiple commits pending multiple shelves will be created.

#+end_quote

--update-shelve CHANGELIST

#+begin_quote
Update an existing shelved changelist with this commit. Implies
--shelve. Repeat for multiple shelved changelists.

#+end_quote

--conflict=(ask|skip|quit)

#+begin_quote
Conflicts can occur when applying a commit to p4. When this happens, the
default behavior ("ask") is to prompt whether to skip this commit and
continue, or quit. This option can be used to bypass the prompt, causing
conflicting commits to be automatically skipped, or to quit trying to
apply commits, without prompting.

#+end_quote

--branch <branch>

#+begin_quote
After submitting, sync this named branch instead of the default
p4/master. See the "Sync options" section above for more information.

#+end_quote

--commit (<sha1>|<sha1>..<sha1>)

#+begin_quote
Submit only the specified commit or range of commits, instead of the
full list of changes that are in the current Git branch.

#+end_quote

--disable-rebase

#+begin_quote
Disable the automatic rebase after all commits have been successfully
submitted. Can also be set with git-p4.disableRebase.

#+end_quote

--disable-p4sync

#+begin_quote
Disable the automatic sync of p4/master from Perforce after commits have
been submitted. Implies --disable-rebase. Can also be set with
git-p4.disableP4Sync. Sync with origin/master still goes ahead if
possible.

#+end_quote

* HOOKS FOR SUBMIT
** p4-pre-submit
The *p4-pre-submit* hook is executed if it exists and is executable. The
hook takes no parameters and nothing from standard input. Exiting with
non-zero status from this script prevents *git-p4 submit* from
launching. It can be bypassed with the *--no-verify* command line
option.

One usage scenario is to run unit tests in the hook.

** p4-prepare-changelist
The *p4-prepare-changelist* hook is executed right after preparing the
default changelist message and before the editor is started. It takes
one parameter, the name of the file that contains the changelist text.
Exiting with a non-zero status from the script will abort the process.

The purpose of the hook is to edit the message file in place, and it is
not suppressed by the *--no-verify* option. This hook is called even if
*--prepare-p4-only* is set.

** p4-changelist
The *p4-changelist* hook is executed after the changelist message has
been edited by the user. It can be bypassed with the *--no-verify*
option. It takes a single parameter, the name of the file that holds the
proposed changelist text. Exiting with a non-zero status causes the
command to abort.

The hook is allowed to edit the changelist file and can be used to
normalize the text into some project standard format. It can also be
used to refuse the Submit after inspect the message file.

** p4-post-changelist
The *p4-post-changelist* hook is invoked after the submit has
successfully occurred in P4. It takes no parameters and is meant
primarily for notification and cannot affect the outcome of the git p4
submit action.

** Rebase options
These options can be used to modify /git p4 rebase/ behavior.

--import-labels

#+begin_quote
Import p4 labels.

#+end_quote

** Unshelve options
--origin

#+begin_quote
Sets the git refspec against which the shelved P4 changelist is
compared. Defaults to p4/master.

#+end_quote

* DEPOT PATH SYNTAX
The p4 depot path argument to /git p4 sync/ and /git p4 clone/ can be
one or more space-separated p4 depot paths, with an optional p4 revision
specifier on the end:

"//depot/my/project"

#+begin_quote
Import one commit with all files in the /#head/ change under that tree.

#+end_quote

"//depot/my/project@all"

#+begin_quote
Import one commit for each change in the history of that depot path.

#+end_quote

"//depot/my/project@1,6"

#+begin_quote
Import only changes 1 through 6.

#+end_quote

"//depot/proj1@all //depot/proj2@all"

#+begin_quote
Import all changes from both named depot paths into a single repository.
Only files below these directories are included. There is not a
subdirectory in Git for each "proj1" and "proj2". You must use the
*--destination* option when specifying more than one depot path. The
revision specifier must be specified identically on each depot path. If
there are files in the depot paths with the same name, the path with the
most recently updated version of the file is the one that appears in
Git.

#+end_quote

See /p4 help revisions/ for the full syntax of p4 revision specifiers.

* CLIENT SPEC
The p4 client specification is maintained with the /p4 client/ command
and contains among other fields, a View that specifies how the depot is
mapped into the client repository. The /clone/ and /sync/ commands can
consult the client spec when given the *--use-client-spec* option or
when the useClientSpec variable is true. After /git p4 clone/, the
useClientSpec variable is automatically set in the repository
configuration file. This allows future /git p4 submit/ commands to work
properly; the submit command looks only at the variable and does not
have a command-line option.

The full syntax for a p4 view is documented in /p4 help views/. /git p4/
knows only a subset of the view syntax. It understands multi-line
mappings, overlays with /+/, exclusions with /-/ and double-quotes
around whitespace. Of the possible wildcards, /git p4/ only handles
/.../, and only when it is at the end of the path. /git p4/ will
complain if it encounters an unhandled wildcard.

Bugs in the implementation of overlap mappings exist. If multiple depot
paths map through overlays to the same location in the repository, /git
p4/ can choose the wrong one. This is hard to solve without dedicating a
client spec just for /git p4/.

The name of the client can be given to /git p4/ in multiple ways. The
variable /git-p4.client/ takes precedence if it exists. Otherwise,
normal p4 mechanisms of determining the client are used: environment
variable *P4CLIENT*, a file referenced by *P4CONFIG*, or the local host
name.

* BRANCH DETECTION
P4 does not have the same concept of a branch as Git. Instead, p4
organizes its content as a directory tree, where by convention different
logical branches are in different locations in the tree. The /p4 branch/
command is used to maintain mappings between different areas in the
tree, and indicate related content. /git p4/ can use these mappings to
determine branch relationships.

If you have a repository where all the branches of interest exist as
subdirectories of a single depot path, you can use *--detect-branches*
when cloning or syncing to have /git p4/ automatically find
subdirectories in p4, and to generate these as branches in Git.

For example, if the P4 repository structure is:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
//depot/main/...
//depot/branch1/...
#+end_example

#+end_quote

And "p4 branch -o branch1" shows a View line that looks like:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
//depot/main/... //depot/branch1/...
#+end_example

#+end_quote

Then this /git p4 clone/ command:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
git p4 clone --detect-branches //depot@all
#+end_example

#+end_quote

produces a separate branch in /refs/remotes/p4// for //depot/main,
called /master/, and one for //depot/branch1 called /depot/branch1/.

However, it is not necessary to create branches in p4 to be able to use
them like branches. Because it is difficult to infer branch
relationships automatically, a Git configuration setting
/git-p4.branchList/ can be used to explicitly identify branch
relationships. It is a list of "source:destination" pairs, like a simple
p4 branch specification, where the "source" and "destination" are the
path elements in the p4 repository. The example above relied on the
presence of the p4 branch. Without p4 branches, the same result will
occur with:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
git init depot
cd depot
git config git-p4.branchList main:branch1
git p4 clone --detect-branches //depot@all .
#+end_example

#+end_quote

* PERFORMANCE
The fast-import mechanism used by /git p4/ creates one pack file for
each invocation of /git p4 sync/. Normally, Git garbage compression
(*git-gc*(1)) automatically compresses these to fewer pack files, but
explicit invocation of /git repack -adf/ may improve performance.

* CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
The following config settings can be used to modify /git p4/ behavior.
They all are in the /git-p4/ section.

** General variables
git-p4.user

#+begin_quote
User specified as an option to all p4 commands, with /-u <user>/. The
environment variable *P4USER* can be used instead.

#+end_quote

git-p4.password

#+begin_quote
Password specified as an option to all p4 commands, with /-P
<password>/. The environment variable *P4PASS* can be used instead.

#+end_quote

git-p4.port

#+begin_quote
Port specified as an option to all p4 commands, with /-p <port>/. The
environment variable *P4PORT* can be used instead.

#+end_quote

git-p4.host

#+begin_quote
Host specified as an option to all p4 commands, with /-h <host>/. The
environment variable *P4HOST* can be used instead.

#+end_quote

git-p4.client

#+begin_quote
Client specified as an option to all p4 commands, with /-c <client>/,
including the client spec.

#+end_quote

git-p4.retries

#+begin_quote
Specifies the number of times to retry a p4 command (notably, /p4 sync/)
if the network times out. The default value is 3. Set the value to 0 to
disable retries or if your p4 version does not support retries (pre
2012.2).

#+end_quote

** Clone and sync variables
git-p4.syncFromOrigin

#+begin_quote
Because importing commits from other Git repositories is much faster
than importing them from p4, a mechanism exists to find p4 changes first
in Git remotes. If branches exist under /refs/remote/origin/p4/, those
will be fetched and used when syncing from p4. This variable can be set
to /false/ to disable this behavior.

#+end_quote

git-p4.branchUser

#+begin_quote
One phase in branch detection involves looking at p4 branches to find
new ones to import. By default, all branches are inspected. This option
limits the search to just those owned by the single user named in the
variable.

#+end_quote

git-p4.branchList

#+begin_quote
List of branches to be imported when branch detection is enabled. Each
entry should be a pair of branch names separated by a colon (:). This
example declares that both branchA and branchB were created from main:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
git config       git-p4.branchList main:branchA
git config --add git-p4.branchList main:branchB
#+end_example

#+end_quote

#+end_quote

git-p4.ignoredP4Labels

#+begin_quote
List of p4 labels to ignore. This is built automatically as unimportable
labels are discovered.

#+end_quote

git-p4.importLabels

#+begin_quote
Import p4 labels into git, as per --import-labels.

#+end_quote

git-p4.labelImportRegexp

#+begin_quote
Only p4 labels matching this regular expression will be imported. The
default value is /[a-zA-Z0-9_\-.]+$/.

#+end_quote

git-p4.useClientSpec

#+begin_quote
Specify that the p4 client spec should be used to identify p4 depot
paths of interest. This is equivalent to specifying the option
*--use-client-spec*. See the "CLIENT SPEC" section above. This variable
is a boolean, not the name of a p4 client.

#+end_quote

git-p4.pathEncoding

#+begin_quote
Perforce keeps the encoding of a path as given by the originating OS.
Git expects paths encoded as UTF-8. Use this config to tell git-p4 what
encoding Perforce had used for the paths. This encoding is used to
transcode the paths to UTF-8. As an example, Perforce on Windows often
uses "cp1252" to encode path names. If this option is passed into a p4
clone request, it is persisted in the resulting new git repo.

#+end_quote

git-p4.metadataDecodingStrategy

#+begin_quote
Perforce keeps the encoding of a changelist descriptions and user full
names as stored by the client on a given OS. The p4v client uses the
OS-local encoding, and so different users can end up storing different
changelist descriptions or user full names in different encodings, in
the same depot. Git tolerates inconsistent/incorrect encodings in commit
messages and author names, but expects them to be specified in utf-8.
git-p4 can use three different decoding strategies in handling the
encoding uncertainty in Perforce: /passthrough/ simply passes the
original bytes through from Perforce to git, creating usable but
incorrectly-encoded data when the Perforce data is encoded as anything
other than utf-8. /strict/ expects the Perforce data to be encoded as
utf-8, and fails to import when this is not true. /fallback/ attempts to
interpret the data as utf-8, and otherwise falls back to using a
secondary encoding - by default the common windows encoding /cp-1252/ -
with upper-range bytes escaped if decoding with the fallback encoding
also fails. Under python2 the default strategy is /passthrough/ for
historical reasons, and under python3 the default is /fallback/. When
/strict/ is selected and decoding fails, the error message will propose
changing this config parameter as a workaround. If this option is passed
into a p4 clone request, it is persisted into the resulting new git
repo.

#+end_quote

git-p4.metadataFallbackEncoding

#+begin_quote
Specify the fallback encoding to use when decoding Perforce author names
and changelists descriptions using the /fallback/ strategy (see
git-p4.metadataDecodingStrategy). The fallback encoding will only be
used when decoding as utf-8 fails. This option defaults to cp1252, a
common windows encoding. If this option is passed into a p4 clone
request, it is persisted into the resulting new git repo.

#+end_quote

git-p4.largeFileSystem

#+begin_quote
Specify the system that is used for large (binary) files. Please note
that large file systems do not support the /git p4 submit/ command. Only
Git LFS is implemented right now (see *https://git-lfs.github.com/* for
more information). Download and install the Git LFS command line
extension to use this option and configure it like this:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
git config       git-p4.largeFileSystem GitLFS
#+end_example

#+end_quote

#+end_quote

git-p4.largeFileExtensions

#+begin_quote
All files matching a file extension in the list will be processed by the
large file system. Do not prefix the extensions with /./.

#+end_quote

git-p4.largeFileThreshold

#+begin_quote
All files with an uncompressed size exceeding the threshold will be
processed by the large file system. By default the threshold is defined
in bytes. Add the suffix k, m, or g to change the unit.

#+end_quote

git-p4.largeFileCompressedThreshold

#+begin_quote
All files with a compressed size exceeding the threshold will be
processed by the large file system. This option might slow down your
clone/sync process. By default the threshold is defined in bytes. Add
the suffix k, m, or g to change the unit.

#+end_quote

git-p4.largeFilePush

#+begin_quote
Boolean variable which defines if large files are automatically pushed
to a server.

#+end_quote

git-p4.keepEmptyCommits

#+begin_quote
A changelist that contains only excluded files will be imported as an
empty commit if this boolean option is set to true.

#+end_quote

git-p4.mapUser

#+begin_quote
Map a P4 user to a name and email address in Git. Use a string with the
following format to create a mapping:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
git config --add git-p4.mapUser "p4user = First Last <mail@address.com>"
#+end_example

#+end_quote

A mapping will override any user information from P4. Mappings for
multiple P4 user can be defined.

#+end_quote

** Submit variables
git-p4.detectRenames

#+begin_quote
Detect renames. See *git-diff*(1). This can be true, false, or a score
as expected by /git diff -M/.

#+end_quote

git-p4.detectCopies

#+begin_quote
Detect copies. See *git-diff*(1). This can be true, false, or a score as
expected by /git diff -C/.

#+end_quote

git-p4.detectCopiesHarder

#+begin_quote
Detect copies harder. See *git-diff*(1). A boolean.

#+end_quote

git-p4.preserveUser

#+begin_quote
On submit, re-author changes to reflect the Git author, regardless of
who invokes /git p4 submit/.

#+end_quote

git-p4.allowMissingP4Users

#+begin_quote
When /preserveUser/ is true, /git p4/ normally dies if it cannot find an
author in the p4 user map. This setting submits the change regardless.

#+end_quote

git-p4.skipSubmitEdit

#+begin_quote
The submit process invokes the editor before each p4 change is
submitted. If this setting is true, though, the editing step is skipped.

#+end_quote

git-p4.skipSubmitEditCheck

#+begin_quote
After editing the p4 change message, /git p4/ makes sure that the
description really was changed by looking at the file modification time.
This option disables that test.

#+end_quote

git-p4.allowSubmit

#+begin_quote
By default, any branch can be used as the source for a /git p4 submit/
operation. This configuration variable, if set, permits only the named
branches to be used as submit sources. Branch names must be the short
names (no "refs/heads/"), and should be separated by commas (","), with
no spaces.

#+end_quote

git-p4.skipUserNameCheck

#+begin_quote
If the user running /git p4 submit/ does not exist in the p4 user map,
/git p4/ exits. This option can be used to force submission regardless.

#+end_quote

git-p4.attemptRCSCleanup

#+begin_quote
If enabled, /git p4 submit/ will attempt to cleanup RCS keywords
($Header$, etc). These would otherwise cause merge conflicts and prevent
the submit going ahead. This option should be considered experimental at
present.

#+end_quote

git-p4.exportLabels

#+begin_quote
Export Git tags to p4 labels, as per --export-labels.

#+end_quote

git-p4.labelExportRegexp

#+begin_quote
Only p4 labels matching this regular expression will be exported. The
default value is /[a-zA-Z0-9_\-.]+$/.

#+end_quote

git-p4.conflict

#+begin_quote
Specify submit behavior when a conflict with p4 is found, as per
--conflict. The default behavior is /ask/.

#+end_quote

git-p4.disableRebase

#+begin_quote
Do not rebase the tree against p4/master following a submit.

#+end_quote

git-p4.disableP4Sync

#+begin_quote
Do not sync p4/master with Perforce following a submit. Implies
git-p4.disableRebase.

#+end_quote

* IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

#+begin_quote
·

Changesets from p4 are imported using Git fast-import.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
·

Cloning or syncing does not require a p4 client; file contents are
collected using /p4 print/.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
·

Submitting requires a p4 client, which is not in the same location as
the Git repository. Patches are applied, one at a time, to this p4
client and submitted from there.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
·

Each commit imported by /git p4/ has a line at the end of the log
message indicating the p4 depot location and change number. This line is
used by later /git p4 sync/ operations to know which p4 changes are new.
