#+TITLE: Manpages - mcookie.1
* NAME
mcookie - generate magic cookies for xauth

* SYNOPSIS
*mcookie* [options]

* DESCRIPTION
*mcookie* generates a 128-bit random hexadecimal number for use with the
X authority system. Typical usage:

#+begin_quote
*xauth add :0 . *=mcookie=\\

#+end_quote

The "random" number generated is actually the MD5 message digest of
random information coming from one of the sources
*getrandom*=(2) system call, =//dev/urandom/=, =//dev/random/=, or the =/libc
pseudo-random
functions/=, in this preference order. See also the option =*--file*=.=

* OPTIONS
*-f*=, =*--file*= =/file/

#+begin_quote
Use this
/file/= as an additional source of randomness (for example =//dev/urandom/=). When =/file/= is -, characters are read from standard input.=

#+end_quote

*-m*=, =*--max-size*= =/number/

#+begin_quote
Read from
/file/= only this =/number/= of bytes. This option is meant to be used when reading additional randomness from a file or device.=

The
/number/= argument may be followed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB=1024, MiB=1024*1024, and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB") or the suffixes KB=1000, MB=1000*1000, and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.=

#+end_quote

*-v*=, =*--verbose*

#+begin_quote
Inform where randomness originated, with amount of entropy read from
each source.

#+end_quote

*-h*=, =*--help*

#+begin_quote
Display help text and exit.

#+end_quote

*-V*=, =*--version*

#+begin_quote
Print version and exit.

#+end_quote

* FILES
//dev/urandom/

//dev/random/

* BUGS
It is assumed that none of the randomness sources will block.
