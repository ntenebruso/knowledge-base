#+TITLE: Manpages - newgrp.1
* NAME
newgrp - log in to a new group

* SYNOPSIS
*newgrp* [-] [/group/]

* DESCRIPTION
The *newgrp* command is used to change the current group ID during a
login session. If the optional *-* flag is given, the users environment
will be reinitialized as though the user had logged in, otherwise the
current environment, including current working directory, remains
unchanged.

*newgrp* changes the current real group ID to the named group, or to the
default group listed in /etc/passwd if no group name is given. *newgrp*
also tries to add the group to the user groupset. If not root, the user
will be prompted for a password if she does not have a password (in
/etc/shadow if this user has an entry in the shadowed password file, or
in /etc/passwd otherwise) and the group does, or if the user is not
listed as a member and the group has a password. The user will be denied
access if the group password is empty and the user is not listed as a
member.

If there is an entry for this group in /etc/gshadow, then the list of
members and the password of this group will be taken from this file,
otherwise, the entry in /etc/group is considered.
