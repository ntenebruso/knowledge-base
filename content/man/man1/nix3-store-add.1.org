This program is *experimental* and its interface is subject to change.

* Name
=nix store add= - Add a file or directory to the Nix store

* Synopsis
=nix store add= [/option/...] /path/

* Description
Copy /path/ to the Nix store, and print the resulting store path on
standard output.

#+begin_quote
*Warning*

The resulting store path is not registered as a garbage collector root,
so it could be deleted before you have a chance to register it.

#+end_quote

* Examples
Add a directory to the store:

#+begin_example
# mkdir dir
# echo foo > dir/bar

# nix store add ./dir
/nix/store/6pmjx56pm94n66n4qw1nff0y1crm8nqg-dir

# cat /nix/store/6pmjx56pm94n66n4qw1nff0y1crm8nqg-dir/bar
foo
#+end_example

* Options
- =--dry-run=

  Show what this command would do without doing it.

- =--hash-algo= /hash-algo/

  Hash algorithm (=md5=, =sha1=, =sha256=, or =sha512=).

- =--mode= /content-address-method/

  How to compute the content-address of the store object. One of:

  - =nar= (the default): Serialises the input as a *Nix Archive* and
    passes that to the hash function.

  - =flat=: Assumes that the input is a single file and *directly
    passes* it to the hash function.

  - =text=: Like =flat=, but used for *derivations* serialized in store
    object and =builtins.toFile=. For advanced use-cases only; for
    regular usage prefer =nar= and =flat=.

- =--name= / =-n= /name/

  Override the name component of the store path. It defaults to the base
  name of /path/.

** Logging-related options
- =--debug=

  Set the logging verbosity level to â€˜debug'.

- =--log-format= /format/

  Set the format of log output; one of =raw=, =internal-json=, =bar= or
  =bar-with-logs=.

- =--print-build-logs= / =-L=

  Print full build logs on standard error.

- =--quiet=

  Decrease the logging verbosity level.

- =--verbose= / =-v=

  Increase the logging verbosity level.

** Miscellaneous global options
- =--help=

  Show usage information.

- =--offline=

  Disable substituters and consider all previously downloaded files
  up-to-date.

- =--option= /name/ /value/

  Set the Nix configuration setting /name/ to /value/ (overriding
  =nix.conf=).

- =--refresh=

  Consider all previously downloaded files out-of-date.

- =--version=

  Show version information.

  *Note*

  See =man nix.conf= for overriding configuration settings with command
  line flags.
