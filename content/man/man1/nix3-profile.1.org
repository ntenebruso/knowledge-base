This program is *experimental* and its interface is subject to change.

#+end_quote

* Name
=nix profile= - manage Nix profiles

* Synopsis
=nix profile= [/option/...] /subcommand/

where /subcommand/ is one of the following:

- =nix profile diff-closures= - show the closure difference between each
  version of a profile

- =nix profile history= - show all versions of a profile

- =nix profile install= - install a package into a profile

- =nix profile list= - list installed packages

- =nix profile remove= - remove packages from a profile

- =nix profile rollback= - roll back to the previous version or a
  specified version of a profile

- =nix profile upgrade= - upgrade packages using their most recent flake

- =nix profile wipe-history= - delete non-current versions of a profile

* Description
=nix profile= allows you to create and manage /Nix profiles/. A Nix
profile is a set of packages that can be installed and upgraded
independently from each other. Nix profiles are versioned, allowing them
to be rolled back easily.

* Files
** Profiles
A directory that contains links to profiles managed by =nix-env= and
=nix profile=:

- =$XDG_STATE_HOME/nix/profiles= for regular users

- =$NIX_STATE_DIR/profiles/per-user/root= if the user is =root=

A profile is a directory of symlinks to files in the Nix store.

** Filesystem layout
Profiles are versioned as follows. When using a profile named /path/,
/path/ is a symlink to /path/=-=/N/=-link=, where /N/ is the version of
the profile. In turn, /path/=-=/N/=-link= is a symlink to a path in the
Nix store. For example:

#+begin_example
$ ls -l ~alice/.local/state/nix/profiles/profile*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 alice users 14 Nov 25 14:35 /home/alice/.local/state/nix/profiles/profile -> profile-7-link
lrwxrwxrwx 1 alice users 51 Oct 28 16:18 /home/alice/.local/state/nix/profiles/profile-5-link -> /nix/store/q69xad13ghpf7ir87h0b2gd28lafjj1j-profile
lrwxrwxrwx 1 alice users 51 Oct 29 13:20 /home/alice/.local/state/nix/profiles/profile-6-link -> /nix/store/6bvhpysd7vwz7k3b0pndn7ifi5xr32dg-profile
lrwxrwxrwx 1 alice users 51 Nov 25 14:35 /home/alice/.local/state/nix/profiles/profile-7-link -> /nix/store/mp0x6xnsg0b8qhswy6riqvimai4gm677-profile
#+end_example

Each of these symlinks is a root for the Nix garbage collector.

The contents of the store path corresponding to each version of the
profile is a tree of symlinks to the files of the installed packages,
e.g.

#+begin_example

#+end_example

Each profile version contains a manifest file: - =manifest.nix= used by
=nix-env=. - =manifest.json= used by =nix profile= (experimental).

** User profile link
A symbolic link to the user's current profile:

- =~/.nix-profile=

- =$XDG_STATE_HOME/nix/profile= if =use-xdg-base-directories= is set to
  =true=.

By default, this symlink points to:

- =$XDG_STATE_HOME/nix/profiles/profile= for regular users

- =$NIX_STATE_DIR/profiles/per-user/root/profile= for =root=

The =PATH= environment variable should include =/bin= subdirectory of
the profile link (e.g. =~/.nix-profile/bin=) for the user environment to
be visible to the user. The *installer* sets this up by default, unless
you enable =use-xdg-base-directories=.

** Profile compatibility

#+begin_quote
*Warning*

Once you have used =nix profile= you can no longer use =nix-env= without
first deleting =$XDG_STATE_HOME/nix/profiles/profile=

#+end_quote

Once you installed a package with =nix profile=, you get the following
error message when using =nix-env=:

#+begin_example
$ nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA 'hello'
error: nix-env
profile '/home/alice/.local/state/nix/profiles/profile' is incompatible with 'nix-env'; please use 'nix profile' instead
#+end_example

To migrate back to =nix-env= you can delete your current profile:

#+begin_quote
*Warning*

This will delete packages that have been installed before, so you may
want to back up this information before running the command.

#+end_quote

#+begin_example
 $ rm -rf "${XDG_STATE_HOME-$HOME/.local/state}/nix/profiles/profile"
#+end_example
