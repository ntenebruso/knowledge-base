#+TITLE: Manpages - git-quiltimport.1
* NAME
git-quiltimport - Applies a quilt patchset onto the current branch

* SYNOPSIS
#+begin_example
git quiltimport [--dry-run | -n] [--author <author>] [--patches <dir>]
                [--series <file>] [--keep-non-patch]
#+end_example

* DESCRIPTION
Applies a quilt patchset onto the current Git branch, preserving the
patch boundaries, patch order, and patch descriptions present in the
quilt patchset.

For each patch the code attempts to extract the author from the patch
description. If that fails it falls back to the author specified with
--author. If the --author flag was not given the patch description is
displayed and the user is asked to interactively enter the author of the
patch.

If a subject is not found in the patch description the patch name is
preserved as the 1 line subject in the Git description.

-n, --dry-run
