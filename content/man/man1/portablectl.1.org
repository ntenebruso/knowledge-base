* NAME
portablectl - Attach, detach or inspect portable service images

* SYNOPSIS
*portablectl* [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND} [NAME...]

* DESCRIPTION
*portablectl* may be used to attach, detach or inspect portable service
images. Its primarily a command interfacing with
*systemd-portabled.service*(8).

Portable service images contain an OS file system tree along with
*systemd*(1) unit file information. A service image may be "attached" to
the local system. If attached, a set of unit files are copied from the
image to the host, and extended with /RootDirectory=/ or /RootImage=/
assignments (in case of service units) pointing to the image file or
directory, ensuring the services will run within the file system context
of the image.

Portable service images are an efficient way to bundle multiple related
services and other units together, and transfer them as a whole between
systems. When these images are attached to the local system, the
contained units may run in most ways like regular system-provided units,
either with full privileges or inside strict sandboxing, depending on
the selected configuration. For more details, see *Portable Services
Documentation*[1].

Portable service images may be of the following kinds:

#+begin_quote
·

Directory trees containing an OS, including the top-level directories
/usr/, /etc/, and so on.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
·

btrfs subvolumes containing OS trees, similar to normal directory trees.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
·

Binary "raw" disk images containing MBR or GPT partition tables and
Linux file system partitions. (These must be regular files, with the
.raw suffix.)

#+end_quote

* COMMANDS
The following commands are understood:

*list*

#+begin_quote
List available portable service images. This will list all portable
service images discovered in the portable image search paths (see
below), along with brief metadata and state information. Note that many
of the commands below may both operate on images inside and outside of
the search paths. This command is hence mostly a convenience option, the
commands are generally not restricted to what this list shows.

Added in version 239.

#+end_quote

*attach* /IMAGE/ [/PREFIX.../]

#+begin_quote
Attach a portable service image to the host system. Expects a file
system path to a portable service image file or directory as first
argument. If the specified path contains no slash character ("/") it is
understood as image filename that is searched for in the portable
service image search paths (see below). To reference a file in the
current working directory prefix the filename with "./" to avoid this
search path logic.

When a portable service is attached four operations are executed:

#+begin_quote
1.

All unit files of types .service, .socket, .target, .timer and .path
which match the indicated unit file name prefix are copied from the
image to the hosts /etc/systemd/system.attached/ directory (or
/run/systemd/system.attached/ --- depending whether *--runtime* is
specified, see below), which is included in the built-in unit search
path of the system service manager.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
2.

For unit files of type .service a drop-in is added to these copies that
adds /RootDirectory=/ or /RootImage=/ settings (see *systemd.unit*(5)
for details), that ensures these services are run within the file system
of the originating portable service image.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
3.

A second drop-in is created: the "profile" drop-in, that may contain
additional security settings (and other settings). A number of profiles
are available by default but administrators may define their own ones.
See below.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
4.

If the portable service image file is not already in the search path
(see below), a symbolic link to it is created in /etc/portables/ or
/run/portables/, to make sure it is included in it.

#+end_quote

By default all unit files whose names start with a prefix generated from
the images file name are copied out. Specifically, the prefix is
determined from the image file name with any suffix such as .raw
removed, truncated at the first occurrence of an underscore character
("_"), if there is one. The underscore logic is supposed to be used to
versioning so that the an image file foobar_47.11.raw will result in a
unit file matching prefix of foobar. This prefix is then compared with
all unit files names contained in the image in the usual directories,
but only unit file names where the prefix is followed by "-", "." or "@"
are considered. Example: if a portable service image file is named
foobar_47.11.raw then by default all its unit files with names such as
foobar-quux-waldi.service, foobar.service or foobar@.service will be
considered. Its possible to override the matching prefix: all strings
listed on the command line after the image file name are considered
prefixes, overriding the implicit logic where the prefix is derived from
the image file name.

By default, after the unit files are attached the service managers
configuration is reloaded, except when *--no-reload* is specified (see
below). This ensures that the new units made available to the service
manager are seen by it.

If *--now* and/or *--enable* are passed, the portable services are
immediately started (blocking operation unless *--no-block* is passed)
and/or enabled after attaching the image.

In place of the image path a ".v/" versioned directory may be specified,
see *systemd.v*(7) for details.

In place of the directory path a ".v/" versioned directory may be
specified, see *systemd.v*(7) for details.

Added in version 239.

#+end_quote

*detach* /IMAGE/ [/PREFIX.../]

#+begin_quote
Detaches a portable service image from the host. This undoes the
operations executed by the *attach* command above, and removes the unit
file copies, drop-ins and image symlink again. This command expects an
image name or path as parameter. Note that if a path is specified only
the last component of it (i.e. the file or directory name itself, not
the path to it) is used for finding matching unit files. This is a
convenience feature to allow all arguments passed as *attach* also to
*detach*.

If *--now* and/or *--enable* are passed, the portable services are
immediately stopped (blocking operation) and/or disabled before
detaching the image. Prefix(es) are also accepted, to be used in case
the unit names do not match the image name as described in the *attach*.

Added in version 239.

#+end_quote

*reattach* /IMAGE/ [/PREFIX.../]

#+begin_quote
Detaches an existing portable service image from the host, and
immediately attaches it again. This is useful in case the image was
replaced. Running units are not stopped during the process. Partial
matching, to allow for different versions in the image name, is allowed:
only the part before the first "_" character has to match. If the new
image doesnt exist, the existing one will not be detached. The
parameters follow the same syntax as the *attach* command.

If *--now* and/or *--enable* are passed, the portable services are
immediately stopped if removed, started and/or enabled if added, or
restarted if updated. Prefixes are also accepted, in the same way as
described in the *attach* case.

Added in version 248.

#+end_quote

*inspect* /IMAGE/ [/PREFIX.../]

#+begin_quote
Extracts various metadata from a portable service image and presents it
to the caller. Specifically, the *os-release*(5) file of the image is
retrieved as well as all matching unit files. By default a short summary
showing the most relevant metadata in combination with a list of
matching unit files is shown (that is the unit files *attach* would
install to the host system). If combined with *--cat* (see above), the
os-release data and the units files contents is displayed unprocessed.
This command is useful to determine whether an image qualifies as
portable service image, and which unit files are included. This command
expects the path to the image as parameter, optionally followed by a
list of unit file prefixes to consider, similar to the *attach* command
described above.

Added in version 239.

#+end_quote

*is-attached* /IMAGE/

#+begin_quote
Determines whether the specified image is currently attached or not.
Unless combined with the *--quiet* switch this will show a short state
identifier for the image. Specifically:

\\
*Table 1. Image attachment states*

| State              | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| *detached*         | The image is currently not attached.                                                                                                                   |
| *attached*         | The image is currently attached, i.e. its unit files have been made available to the host system.                                                      |
| *attached-runtime* | Like *attached*, but the unit files have been made available transiently only, i.e. the *attach* command has been invoked with the *--runtime* option. |
| *enabled*          | The image is currently attached, and at least one unit file associated with it has been enabled.                                                       |
| *enabled-runtime*  | Like *enabled*, but the unit files have been made available transiently only, i.e. the *attach* command has been invoked with the *--runtime* option.  |
| *running*          | The image is currently attached, and at least one unit file associated with it is running.                                                             |
| *running-runtime*  | The image is currently attached transiently, and at least one unit file associated with it is running.                                                 |

Added in version 239.

#+end_quote

*read-only* /IMAGE/ [/BOOL/]

#+begin_quote
Marks or (unmarks) a portable service image read-only. Takes an image
name, followed by a boolean as arguments. If the boolean is omitted,
positive is implied, i.e. the image is marked read-only.

Added in version 239.

#+end_quote

*remove* /IMAGE/...

#+begin_quote
Removes one or more portable service images. Note that this command will
only remove the specified image path itself --- it refers to a symbolic
link then the symbolic link is removed and not the image it points to.

Added in version 239.

#+end_quote

*set-limit* [/IMAGE/] /BYTES/

#+begin_quote
Sets the maximum size in bytes that a specific portable service image,
or all images, may grow up to on disk (disk quota). Takes either one or
two parameters. The first, optional parameter refers to a portable
service image name. If specified, the size limit of the specified image
is changed. If omitted, the overall size limit of the sum of all images
stored locally is changed. The final argument specifies the size limit
in bytes, possibly suffixed by the usual K, M, G, T units. If the size
limit shall be disabled, specify "-" as size.

Note that per-image size limits are only supported on btrfs file
systems. Also, depending on /BindPaths=/ settings in the portable
services unit files directories from the host might be visible in the
image environment during runtime which are not affected by this setting,
as only the image itself is counted against this limit.

Added in version 239.

#+end_quote

* OPTIONS
The following options are understood:

*-q*, *--quiet*

#+begin_quote
Suppresses additional informational output while running.

Added in version 239.

#+end_quote

*-p* /PROFILE/, *--profile=*/PROFILE/

#+begin_quote
When attaching an image, select the profile to use. By default the
"default" profile is used. For details about profiles, see below.

Added in version 239.

#+end_quote

*--copy=*

#+begin_quote
When attaching an image, select whether to prefer copying or symlinking
of files installed into the host system. Takes one of "copy" (files will
be copied), "symlink" (to prefer creation of symbolic links), "auto" for
an intermediary mode where security profile drop-ins and images are
symlinked while unit files are copied, or "mixed" (since v256) where
security profile drop-ins are symlinked while unit files and images are
copied. Note that this option expresses a preference only, in cases
where symbolic links cannot be created --- for example when the image
operated on is a raw disk image, and hence not directly referentiable
from the host file system --- copying of files is used unconditionally.

Added in version 239.

#+end_quote

*--runtime*

#+begin_quote
When specified the unit and drop-in files are placed in
/run/systemd/system.attached/ instead of /etc/systemd/system.attached/.
Images attached with this option set hence remain attached only until
the next reboot, while they are normally attached persistently.

Added in version 239.

#+end_quote

*--no-reload*

#+begin_quote
Dont reload the service manager after attaching or detaching a portable
service image. Normally the service manager is reloaded to ensure it is
aware of added or removed unit files.

Added in version 239.

#+end_quote

*--cat*

#+begin_quote
When inspecting portable service images, show the (unprocessed) contents
of the metadata files pulled from the image, instead of brief summaries.
Specifically, this will show the *os-release*(5) and unit file contents
of the image.

Added in version 239.

#+end_quote

*--enable*

#+begin_quote
Immediately enable/disable the portable service after
attaching/detaching.

Added in version 245.

#+end_quote

*--now*

#+begin_quote
Immediately start/stop/restart the portable service after
attaching/before detaching/after upgrading.

Added in version 245.

#+end_quote

*--no-block*

#+begin_quote
Dont block waiting for attach --now to complete.

Added in version 245.

#+end_quote

*--clean*

#+begin_quote
When detaching ensure the configuration, state, logs, cache, and runtime
data directories of the portable service are removed from the host
system.

Added in version 256.

#+end_quote

*--extension=*/PATH/

#+begin_quote
Add an additional image /PATH/ as an overlay on top of /IMAGE/ when
attaching/detaching. This argument can be specified multiple times, in
which case the order in which images are laid down follows the rules
specified in *systemd.exec*(5) for the /ExtensionImages=/ directive and
for the *systemd-sysext*(8) and *systemd-confext*(8) tools. The images
must contain an extension-release file with metadata that matches what
is defined in the os-release of /IMAGE/. See: *os-release*(5). Images
can be block images, btrfs subvolumes or directories. For more
information on portable services with extensions, see the "Extension
Images" paragraph on *Portable Services Documentation*[1].

Note that the same extensions have to be specified, in the same order,
when attaching and detaching.

In place of the image path a ".v/" versioned directory may be specified,
see *systemd.v*(7) for details.

In place of the directory path a ".v/" versioned directory may be
specified, see *systemd.v*(7) for details.

Added in version 249.

#+end_quote

*--force*

#+begin_quote
Skip safety checks and attach or detach images (with extensions) without
first ensuring that the units are not running, and do not insist that
the extension-release./NAME/ file in the extension image has to match
the image filename.

Added in version 252.

#+end_quote

*-H*, *--host=*

#+begin_quote
Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a username and
hostname separated by "@", to connect to. The hostname may optionally be
suffixed by a port ssh is listening on, separated by ":", and then a
container name, separated by "/", which connects directly to a specific
container on the specified host. This will use SSH to talk to the remote
machine manager instance. Container names may be enumerated with
*machinectl -H */HOST/. Put IPv6 addresses in brackets.

#+end_quote

*-M*, *--machine=*

#+begin_quote
Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container name to
connect to, optionally prefixed by a user name to connect as and a
separating "@" character. If the special string ".host" is used in place
of the container name, a connection to the local system is made (which
is useful to connect to a specific users user bus: "--user
--machine=lennart@.host"). If the "@" syntax is not used, the connection
is made as root user. If the "@" syntax is used either the left hand
side or the right hand side may be omitted (but not both) in which case
the local user name and ".host" are implied.

#+end_quote

*--no-pager*

#+begin_quote
Do not pipe output into a pager.

#+end_quote

*--no-legend*

#+begin_quote
Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer with hints.

#+end_quote

*--no-ask-password*

#+begin_quote
Do not query the user for authentication for privileged operations.

#+end_quote

*-h*, *--help*

#+begin_quote
Print a short help text and exit.

#+end_quote

*--version*

#+begin_quote
Print a short version string and exit.

#+end_quote

* FILES AND DIRECTORIES
Portable service images are preferably stored in /var/lib/portables/,
but are also searched for in /etc/portables/, /run/systemd/portables/,
/usr/local/lib/portables/ and /usr/lib/portables/. Its recommended not
to place image files directly in /etc/portables/ or
/run/systemd/portables/ (as these are generally not suitable for storing
large or non-textual data), but use these directories only for linking
images located elsewhere into the image search path.

When a portable service image is attached, matching unit files are
copied onto the host into the /etc/systemd/system.attached/ and
/run/systemd/system.attached/ directories. When an image is detached,
the unit files are removed again from these directories.

* PROFILES
When portable service images are attached a "profile" drop-in is linked
in, which may be used to enforce additional security (and other)
restrictions locally. Four profile drop-ins are defined by default, and
shipped in /usr/lib/systemd/portable/profile/. Additional, local
profiles may be defined by placing them in
/etc/systemd/portable/profile/. The default profiles are:

\\
*Table 2. Profiles*

| Name      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| default   | This is the default profile if no other profile name is set via the *--profile=* (see above). Its fairly restrictive, but should be useful for common, unprivileged system workloads. This includes write access to the logging framework, as well as IPC access to the D-Bus system. |
| nonetwork | Very similar to default, but networking is turned off for any services of the portable service image.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| strict    | A profile with very strict settings. This profile excludes IPC (D-Bus) and network access.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| trusted   | A profile with very relaxed settings. In this profile the services run with full privileges.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

For details on these profiles and their effects see their precise
definitions, e.g. /usr/lib/systemd/portable/profile/default/service.conf
and similar.

* EXIT STATUS
On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

* ENVIRONMENT
/$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL/

#+begin_quote
The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a higher log
level, i.e. less important ones, will be suppressed). Takes a
comma-separated list of values. A value may be either one of (in order
of decreasing importance) *emerg*, *alert*, *crit*, *err*, *warning*,
*notice*, *info*, *debug*, or an integer in the range 0...7. See
*syslog*(3) for more information. Each value may optionally be prefixed
with one of *console*, *syslog*, *kmsg* or *journal* followed by a colon
to set the maximum log level for that specific log target (e.g.
*SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug,console:info* specifies to log at debug level
except when logging to the console which should be at info level). Note
that the global maximum log level takes priority over any per target
maximum log levels.

#+end_quote

/$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR/

#+begin_quote
A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be colored
according to priority.

This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the
terminal, because *journalctl*(1) and other tools that display logs will
color messages based on the log level on their own.

#+end_quote

/$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME/

#+begin_quote
A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed with a
timestamp.

This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the
terminal or a file, because *journalctl*(1) and other tools that display
logs will attach timestamps based on the entry metadata on their own.

#+end_quote

/$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION/

#+begin_quote
A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename and line
number in the source code where the message originates.

Note that the log location is often attached as metadata to journal
entries anyway. Including it directly in the message text can
nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

#+end_quote

/$SYSTEMD_LOG_TID/

#+begin_quote
A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with the current numerical
thread ID (TID).

Note that the this information is attached as metadata to journal
entries anyway. Including it directly in the message text can
nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

#+end_quote

/$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET/

#+begin_quote
The destination for log messages. One of *console* (log to the attached
tty), *console-prefixed* (log to the attached tty but with prefixes
encoding the log level and "facility", see *syslog*(3), *kmsg* (log to
the kernel circular log buffer), *journal* (log to the journal),
*journal-or-kmsg* (log to the journal if available, and to kmsg
otherwise), *auto* (determine the appropriate log target automatically,
the default), *null* (disable log output).

#+end_quote

/$SYSTEMD_LOG_RATELIMIT_KMSG/

#+begin_quote
Whether to ratelimit kmsg or not. Takes a boolean. Defaults to "true".
If disabled, systemd will not ratelimit messages written to kmsg.

#+end_quote

/$SYSTEMD_PAGER/

#+begin_quote
Pager to use when *--no-pager* is not given; overrides /$PAGER/. If
neither /$SYSTEMD_PAGER/ nor /$PAGER/ are set, a set of well-known pager
implementations are tried in turn, including *less*(1) and *more*(1),
until one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is
invoked. Setting this environment variable to an empty string or the
value "cat" is equivalent to passing *--no-pager*.

Note: if /$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE/ is not set, /$SYSTEMD_PAGER/ (as well as
/$PAGER/) will be silently ignored.

#+end_quote

/$SYSTEMD_LESS/

#+begin_quote
Override the options passed to *less* (by default "FRSXMK").

Users might want to change two options in particular:

*K*

#+begin_quote
This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when Ctrl+C is
pressed. To allow *less* to handle Ctrl+C itself to switch back to the
pager command prompt, unset this option.

If the value of /$SYSTEMD_LESS/ does not include "K", and the pager that
is invoked is *less*, Ctrl+C will be ignored by the executable, and
needs to be handled by the pager.

#+end_quote

*X*

#+begin_quote
This option instructs the pager to not send termcap initialization and
deinitialization strings to the terminal. It is set by default to allow
command output to remain visible in the terminal even after the pager
exits. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager functionality from
working, in particular paged output cannot be scrolled with the mouse.

#+end_quote

Note that setting the regular /$LESS/ environment variable has no effect
for *less* invocations by systemd tools.

See *less*(1) for more discussion.

#+end_quote

/$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET/

#+begin_quote
Override the charset passed to *less* (by default "utf-8", if the
invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).

Note that setting the regular /$LESSCHARSET/ environment variable has no
effect for *less* invocations by systemd tools.

#+end_quote

/$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE/

#+begin_quote
Takes a boolean argument. When true, the "secure" mode of the pager is
enabled; if false, disabled. If /$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE/ is not set at
all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the
owner of the login session, see *geteuid*(2) and
*sd_pid_get_owner_uid*(3). In secure mode, *LESSSECURE=1* will be set
when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open
or create new files or start new subprocesses. When
/$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE/ is not set at all, pagers which are not known to
implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only *less*(1)
implements secure mode.)

Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for example
under *sudo*(8) or *pkexec*(1), care must be taken to ensure that
unintended interactive features are not enabled. "Secure" mode for the
pager may be enabled automatically as describe above. Setting
/SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0/ or not removing it from the inherited
environment allows the user to invoke arbitrary commands. Note that if
the /$SYSTEMD_PAGER/ or /$PAGER/ variables are to be honoured,
/$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE/ must be set too. It might be reasonable to
completely disable the pager using *--no-pager* instead.

#+end_quote

/$SYSTEMD_COLORS/

#+begin_quote
Takes a boolean argument. When true, *systemd* and related utilities
