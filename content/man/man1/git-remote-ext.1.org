#+TITLE: Manpages - git-remote-ext.1
* NAME
git-remote-ext - Bridge smart transport to external command.

* SYNOPSIS
#+begin_example
git remote add <nick> "ext::<command>[ <arguments>...]"
#+end_example

* DESCRIPTION
This remote helper uses the specified /<command>/ to connect to a remote
Git server.

Data written to stdin of the specified /<command>/ is assumed to be sent
to a git:// server, git-upload-pack, git-receive-pack or
git-upload-archive (depending on situation), and data read from stdout
of <command> is assumed to be received from the same service.

Command and arguments are separated by an unescaped space.

The following sequences have a special meaning:

%

#+begin_quote
Literal space in command or argument.

#+end_quote

/%%/

#+begin_quote
Literal percent sign.

#+end_quote

/%s/

#+begin_quote
Replaced with name (receive-pack, upload-pack, or upload-archive) of the
service Git wants to invoke.

#+end_quote

/%S/

#+begin_quote
Replaced with long name (git-receive-pack, git-upload-pack, or
git-upload-archive) of the service Git wants to invoke.

#+end_quote

/%G/ (must be the first characters in an argument)

#+begin_quote
This argument will not be passed to /<command>/. Instead, it will cause
the helper to start by sending git:// service requests to the remote
side with the service field set to an appropriate value and the
repository field set to the rest of the argument. Default is not to send
such a request.

This is useful if the remote side is git:// server accessed over some
tunnel.

#+end_quote

/%V/ (must be first characters in argument)

#+begin_quote
This argument will not be passed to /<command>/. Instead it sets the
vhost field in the git:// service request (to the rest of the argument).
Default is not to send vhost in such request (if sent).

#+end_quote

* ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
GIT_TRANSLOOP_DEBUG

#+begin_quote
If set, prints debugging information about various reads/writes.

#+end_quote

* ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES PASSED TO COMMAND
GIT_EXT_SERVICE

#+begin_quote
Set to long name (git-upload-pack, etc...) of service helper needs to
invoke.

#+end_quote

GIT_EXT_SERVICE_NOPREFIX

#+begin_quote
Set to long name (upload-pack, etc...) of service helper needs to
invoke.

#+end_quote

* EXAMPLES
This remote helper is transparently used by Git when you use commands
such as "git fetch <URL>", "git clone <URL>", , "git push <URL>" or "git
remote add <nick> <URL>", where <URL> begins with *ext::*. Examples:

"ext::ssh -i /home/foo/.ssh/somekey user@host.example %S /foo/repo/"

#+begin_quote
Like host.example:foo/repo, but use /home/foo/.ssh/somekey as keypair
and user as the user on the remote side. This avoids the need to edit
.ssh/config.

#+end_quote

"ext::socat -t3600 - ABSTRACT-CONNECT:/git-server %G/somerepo"

#+begin_quote
Represents repository with path /somerepo accessible over git protocol
at the abstract namespace address /git-server.

#+end_quote

"ext::git-server-alias foo %G/repo"

#+begin_quote
Represents a repository with path /repo accessed using the helper
program "git-server-alias foo". The path to the repository and type of
request are not passed on the command line but as part of the protocol
stream, as usual with git:// protocol.

#+end_quote

"ext::git-server-alias foo %G/repo %Vfoo"

#+begin_quote
Represents a repository with path /repo accessed using the helper
program "git-server-alias foo". The hostname for the remote server
passed in the protocol stream will be "foo" (this allows multiple
virtual Git servers to share a link-level address).

#+end_quote

"ext::git-server-alias foo %G/repo% with% spaces %Vfoo"

#+begin_quote
Represents a repository with path */repo with spaces* accessed using the
helper program "git-server-alias foo". The hostname for the remote
server passed in the protocol stream will be "foo" (this allows multiple
virtual Git servers to share a link-level address).

#+end_quote

"ext::git-ssl foo.example /bar"

#+begin_quote
Represents a repository accessed using the helper program "git-ssl
foo.example /bar". The type of request can be determined by the helper
using environment variables (see above).

#+end_quote
