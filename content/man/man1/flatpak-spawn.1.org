#+TITLE: Manpages - flatpak-spawn.1
* NAME
flatpak-spawn - Run commands in a sandbox

* SYNOPSIS
*flatpak-spawn* [OPTION...] COMMAND [ARGUMENT...]

* DESCRIPTION
Unlike other flatpak commands, *flatpak-spawn* is available to
applications inside the sandbox. It runs COMMAND outside the sandbox:
either in another sandbox, or on the host.

When called without *--host*, *flatpak-spawn* uses the Flatpak portal to
create a copy of the sandbox it was called from, optionally using
tighter permissions and optionally the latest version of the app and
runtime (see *--latest-version*).

* OPTIONS
The following options are understood:

*-h*, *--help*

#+begin_quote
Show help options and exit.

#+end_quote

*-v*, *--verbose*

#+begin_quote
Print debug information

#+end_quote

*--forward-fd=FD*

#+begin_quote
Forward a file descriptor

#+end_quote

*--clear-env*

#+begin_quote
Run with a clean environment

#+end_quote

*--watch-bus*

#+begin_quote
Make the spawned command exit if the caller disappears from the session
bus

#+end_quote

*--env=VAR=VALUE*

#+begin_quote
Set an environment variable

#+end_quote

*--latest-version*

#+begin_quote
Use the latest version of the refs that are used to set up the sandbox

#+end_quote

*--no-network*

#+begin_quote
Run without network access

#+end_quote

*--sandbox*

#+begin_quote
Run fully sandboxed. See the documentation for the *--sandbox* option in
*flatpak-run*(1)

See the *--sandbox-expose* and *--sandbox-expose-ro* options for
selective file access.

#+end_quote

*--sandbox-expose=NAME*

#+begin_quote
Expose read-write access to a file in the sandbox.

Note that absolute paths or subdirectories are not allowed. The files
must be in the sandbox subdirectory of the instance directory (i.e.
~/.var/app/$APP_ID/sandbox).

This option is useful in combination with *--sandbox* (otherwise the
instance directory is accessible anyway).

#+end_quote

*--sandbox-expose-ro=NAME*

#+begin_quote
Expose readonly access to a file in the sandbox.

Note that absolute paths or subdirectories are not allowed. The files
must be in the sandbox subdirectory of the instance directory (i.e.
~/.var/app/$APP_ID/sandbox).

This option is useful in combination with *--sandbox* (otherwise the
instance directory is accessible anyway).

#+end_quote

*--host*

#+begin_quote
Run the command unsandboxed on the host. This requires access to the
org.freedesktop.Flatpak D-Bus interface.

#+end_quote

*--directory=DIR*

#+begin_quote
The working directory in which to run the command.

Note that the given directory must exist in the sandbox or, when used in
conjunction with *--host*, on the host.

#+end_quote

* EXAMPLES
*$ flatpak-spawn ls /var/run*
