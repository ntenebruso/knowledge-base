* NAME
git-prune-packed - Remove extra objects that are already in pack files

* SYNOPSIS
#+begin_example
git prune-packed [-n | --dry-run] [-q | --quiet]
#+end_example

* DESCRIPTION
This program searches the *$GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY* for all objects that
currently exist in a pack file as well as in the independent object
directories.

All such extra objects are removed.

A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with delta
compression applied, stored in a single file, with an associated index
file.

Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines,
disk storage, etc.

#+begin_quote
Don't actually remove any objects, only show those that would have been
removed.

#+end_quote

-q, --quiet

#+begin_quote
