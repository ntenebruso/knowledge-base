#+TITLE: Manpages - flatpak-mask.1
* NAME
flatpak-mask - Mask out updates and automatic installation

* SYNOPSIS
*flatpak mask* [OPTION...] PATTERN...

* DESCRIPTION
Flatpak maintains a list of patterns that define which refs are masked.
A masked ref will never be updated or automatically installed (for
example a masked extension marked auto-download will not be downloaded).
You can still manually install such refs, but once they are installed
the version will be pinned.

The patterns are just a partial ref, with the * character matching
anything within that part of the ref. Here are some example patterns:

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
org.some.App
org.some.App//unstable
app/org.domain.*
org.some.App/arm
#+end_example

#+end_quote

To list the current set of masks, run this command without any patterns.

* OPTIONS
The following options are understood:

*-h*, *--help*

#+begin_quote
Show help options and exit.

#+end_quote

*--remove*

#+begin_quote
Instead of adding the patterns, remove matching patterns.

#+end_quote

*-u*, *--user*

#+begin_quote
Mask refs in a per-user installation.

#+end_quote

*--system*

#+begin_quote
Mask refs in the default system-wide installation.

#+end_quote

*--installation=NAME*

#+begin_quote
Mask refs in a system-wide installation specified by NAME among those
defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using *--installation=default*
is equivalent to using *--system*.

#+end_quote

*-v*, *--verbose*

#+begin_quote
Print debug information during command processing.

#+end_quote

* EXAMPLES
*$ flatpak mask*
