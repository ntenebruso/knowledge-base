* Name
=nix store verify= - verify the integrity of store paths

* Synopsis
=nix store verify= [/option/...] /installables/...

* Examples
- Verify the entire Nix store:

#+begin_example
# nix store verify --all
#+end_example

- Check whether each path in the closure of Firefox has at least 2
  signatures:

#+begin_example
# nix store verify --recursive --sigs-needed 2 --no-contents $(type -p firefox)
#+end_example

- Verify a store path in the binary cache =https://cache.nixos.org/=:

#+begin_example
# nix store verify --store https://cache.nixos.org/ \
  /nix/store/v5sv61sszx301i0x6xysaqzla09nksnd-hello-2.10
#+end_example

* Description
This command verifies the integrity of the store paths /installables/,
or, if =--all= is given, the entire Nix store. For each path, it checks
that

- its contents match the NAR hash recorded in the Nix database; and

- it is /trusted/, that is, it is signed by at least one trusted signing
  key, is content-addressed, or is built locally (“ultimately trusted”).

* Exit status
The exit status of this command is the sum of the following values:

- *1* if any path is corrupted (i.e. its contents don't match the
  recorded NAR hash).

- *2* if any path is untrusted.

- *4* if any path couldn't be verified for any other reason (such as an
  I/O error).

* Options
- =--no-contents=

  Do not verify the contents of each store path.

- =--no-trust=

  Do not verify whether each store path is trusted.

- =--sigs-needed= / =-n= /n/

  Require that each path is signed by at least /n/ different keys.

- =--stdin=

  Read installables from the standard input. No default installable
  applied.

- =--substituter= / =-s= /store-uri/

  Use signatures from the specified store.

** Common evaluation options
- =--arg= /name/ /expr/

  Pass the value /expr/ as the argument /name/ to Nix functions.

- =--arg-from-file= /name/ /path/

  Pass the contents of file /path/ as the argument /name/ to Nix
  functions.

- =--arg-from-stdin= /name/

  Pass the contents of stdin as the argument /name/ to Nix functions.

- =--argstr= /name/ /string/

  Pass the string /string/ as the argument /name/ to Nix functions.

- =--debugger=

  Start an interactive environment if evaluation fails.

- =--eval-store= /store-url/

  The *URL of the Nix store* to use for evaluation, i.e. to store
  derivations (=.drv= files) and inputs referenced by them.

- =--impure=

  Allow access to mutable paths and repositories.

- =--include= / =-I= /path/

  Add /path/ to search path entries used to resolve *lookup paths*

  This option may be given multiple times.

  Paths added through =-I= take precedence over the =nix-path=
  configuration setting and the =NIX_PATH= environment variable.

- =--override-flake= /original-ref/ /resolved-ref/

  Override the flake registries, redirecting /original-ref/ to
  /resolved-ref/.

** Common flake-related options
- =--commit-lock-file=

  Commit changes to the flake's lock file.

- =--inputs-from= /flake-url/

  Use the inputs of the specified flake as registry entries.

- =--no-registries=

  Don't allow lookups in the flake registries.

  #+begin_quote
  *DEPRECATED*

  #+end_quote

  #+begin_quote
  Use =--no-use-registries= instead.

  #+end_quote

- =--no-update-lock-file=

  Do not allow any updates to the flake's lock file.

- =--no-write-lock-file=

  Do not write the flake's newly generated lock file.

- =--output-lock-file= /flake-lock-path/

  Write the given lock file instead of =flake.lock= within the top-level
  flake.

- =--override-input= /input-path/ /flake-url/

  Override a specific flake input (e.g. =dwarffs/nixpkgs=). This implies
  =--no-write-lock-file=.

- =--recreate-lock-file=

  Recreate the flake's lock file from scratch.

  #+begin_quote
  *DEPRECATED*

  #+end_quote

  #+begin_quote
  Use =nix flake update= instead.

  #+end_quote

- =--reference-lock-file= /flake-lock-path/

  Read the given lock file instead of =flake.lock= within the top-level
  flake.

- =--update-input= /input-path/

  Update a specific flake input (ignoring its previous entry in the lock
  file).

  #+begin_quote
  *DEPRECATED*

  #+end_quote

  #+begin_quote
  Use =nix flake update= instead.

  #+end_quote

** Logging-related options
- =--debug=

  Set the logging verbosity level to ‘debug'.

- =--log-format= /format/

  Set the format of log output; one of =raw=, =internal-json=, =bar= or
  =bar-with-logs=.

- =--print-build-logs= / =-L=

  Print full build logs on standard error.

- =--quiet=

  Decrease the logging verbosity level.

- =--verbose= / =-v=

  Increase the logging verbosity level.

** Miscellaneous global options
- =--help=

  Show usage information.

- =--offline=

  Disable substituters and consider all previously downloaded files
  up-to-date.

- =--option= /name/ /value/

  Set the Nix configuration setting /name/ to /value/ (overriding
  =nix.conf=).

- =--refresh=

  Consider all previously downloaded files out-of-date.

- =--repair=

  During evaluation, rewrite missing or corrupted files in the Nix
  store. During building, rebuild missing or corrupted store paths.

- =--version=

  Show version information.

** Options that change the interpretation of *installables*
- =--all=

  Apply the operation to every store path.

- =--derivation=

  Operate on the *store derivation* rather than its outputs.

- =--expr= /expr/

  Interpret /installables/ as attribute paths relative to the Nix
  expression /expr/.

- =--file= / =-f= /file/

  Interpret /installables/ as attribute paths relative to the Nix
  expression stored in /file/. If /file/ is the character -, then a Nix
  expression will be read from standard input. Implies =--impure=.

- =--recursive= / =-r=

  Apply operation to closure of the specified paths.

  *Note*

  See =man nix.conf= for overriding configuration settings with command
  line flags.
