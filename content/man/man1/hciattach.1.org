#+TITLE: Manpages - hciattach.1
* NAME
hciattach - attach serial devices via UART HCI to BlueZ stack

* SYNOPSIS
*hciattach* [/OPTIONS/] </tty/> </type|id/> [/speed/] [/flow/] [/sleep/]
[/bdaddr/]

*hciattach* -1

* DESCRIPTION
*hciattach(1)* is used to attach a serial UART to the Bluetooth stack as
HCI transport interface.

* OPTIONS

#+begin_quote
- *-i* :: Send break

- *-n* :: Don't detach from controlling terminal.

- *-p* :: Print the PID when detaching.

- *-t*/ timeout/ :: Specify an initialization timeout. Default is 5
  seconds.

- *-s*/ speed/ :: Specify an initial speed instead of the hardware
  default.

- *-l* :: List all available configurations.

- *-r* :: Set the HCI device into raw mode. The kernel and bluetooth
  daemon will ignore it.

- *-h*,* --help* :: Show help options

#+end_quote

* ARGUMENTS

#+begin_quote
- */show/* :: This specifies the serial device to attach. A leading /dev
  can be omitted.

  Examples: */dev/ttyS1 ttyS2*

- */type|id/* :: The /type/* or */id/* of the Bluetooth device that is
  to be attached,* i.e. vendor or other device specific identifier.
  Currently supported types are

#+begin_quote
- */speed/* :: The /speed/* specifies the UART speed to use. Baudrates
  higher than 115200bps* require vendor specific initializations that
  are not implemented for all types of devices. In general the following
  speeds are supported:

  Supported vendor devices are automatically initialised to their
  respective best settings.

- */flow/* :: If the /flow/* is appended to the list of options then
  hardware flow control* is forced on the serial link (*CRTSCTS). All
  above mentioned device* types have flow set by default. To force no
  flow control use /noflow/ instead.

- */sleep|nosleep/* :: Enables hardware specific power management
  feature. If /sleep/* is appended* to the list of options then this
  feature is enabled. To disable this feature use /nosleep/* instead.
  All above mentioned device types have* /nosleep/* set by default.*

  Note: This option will only be valid for hardware which support
  hardware specific power management enable option from host.

- */bdaddr/* :: The bdaddr specifies the Bluetooth Address to use. Some
  devices (like the STLC2500) do not store the Bluetooth address in
  hardware memory. Instead it must be uploaded during the initialization
  process. If this argument is specified, then the address will be used
  to initialize the device. Otherwise, a default address will be used.
