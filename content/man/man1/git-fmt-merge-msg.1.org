#+TITLE: Manpages - git-fmt-merge-msg.1
* NAME
git-fmt-merge-msg - Produce a merge commit message

* SYNOPSIS
#+begin_example
git fmt-merge-msg [-m <message>] [--into-name <branch>] [--log[=<n>] | --no-log]
git fmt-merge-msg [-m <message>] [--log[=<n>] | --no-log] -F <file>
#+end_example

* DESCRIPTION
Takes the list of merged objects on stdin and produces a suitable commit
message to be used for the merge commit, usually to be passed as the
/<merge-message>/ argument of /git merge/.

This command is intended mostly for internal use by scripts
automatically invoking /git merge/.

* OPTIONS
--log[=<n>]

#+begin_quote
In addition to branch names, populate the log message with one-line
descriptions from the actual commits that are being merged. At most <n>
commits from each merge parent will be used (20 if <n> is omitted). This
overrides the *merge.log* configuration variable.

#+end_quote

--no-log

#+begin_quote
Do not list one-line descriptions from the actual commits being merged.

#+end_quote

--[no-]summary

#+begin_quote
Synonyms to --log and --no-log; these are deprecated and will be removed
in the future.

#+end_quote

-m <message>, --message <message>

#+begin_quote
Use <message> instead of the branch names for the first line of the log
message. For use with *--log*.

#+end_quote

--into-name <branch>

#+begin_quote
Prepare the merge message as if merging to the branch *<branch>*,
instead of the name of the real branch to which the merge is made.

#+end_quote

-F <file>, --file <file>

#+begin_quote
Take the list of merged objects from <file> instead of stdin.

#+end_quote

* CONFIGURATION
merge.branchdesc

#+begin_quote
In addition to branch names, populate the log message with the branch
description text associated with them. Defaults to false.

#+end_quote

merge.log

#+begin_quote
In addition to branch names, populate the log message with at most the
specified number of one-line descriptions from the actual commits that
are being merged. Defaults to false, and true is a synonym for 20.

#+end_quote

merge.suppressDest

#+begin_quote
By adding a glob that matches the names of integration branches to this
multi-valued configuration variable, the default merge message computed
for merges into these integration branches will omit "into <branch
name>" from its title.

An element with an empty value can be used to clear the list of globs
accumulated from previous configuration entries. When there is no
*merge.suppressDest* variable defined, the default value of *master* is
used for backward compatibility.

#+end_quote

merge.summary

#+begin_quote
Synonym to *merge.log*; this is deprecated and will be removed in the
future.

#+end_quote

* EXAMPLES

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
$ git fetch origin master
$ git fmt-merge-msg --log <$GIT_DIR/FETCH_HEAD
#+end_example

#+end_quote

Print a log message describing a merge of the "master" branch from the
"origin" remote.
