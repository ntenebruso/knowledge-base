#+TITLE: Manpages - scriptlive.1
* NAME
scriptlive - re-run session typescripts, using timing information

* SYNOPSIS
*scriptlive* [options] [*-t*] /timingfile/ [*-I*|*-B*] /typescript/

* DESCRIPTION
This program re-runs a typescript, using stdin typescript and timing
information to ensure that input happens in the same rhythm as it
originally appeared when the script was recorded.

The *session is executed* in a newly created pseudoterminal with the
user's $SHELL (or defaults to //bin/bash/).

*Be careful!* Do not forget that the typescript may contains arbitrary
commands. It is recommended to use *"scriptreplay --stream in --log-in
typescript"* (or with *--log-io* instead of *--log-in*) to verify the
typescript before it is executed by *scriptlive*.

The timing information is what *script*(1) outputs to file specified by
*--log-timing*. The typescript has to contain stdin information and it
is what script1 outputs to file specified by *--log-in* or *--log-io*.

* OPTIONS
*-I*, *--log-in* /file/

#+begin_quote
File containing *script*s terminal input.

#+end_quote

*-B*, *--log-io* /file/

#+begin_quote
File containing *script*s terminal output and input.

#+end_quote

*-t*, *--timing* /file/

#+begin_quote
File containing *script*s timing output. This option overrides old-style
arguments.

#+end_quote

*-T*, *--log-timing* /file/

#+begin_quote
Aliased to *-t*, maintained for compatibility with *script*(1)
command-line options.

#+end_quote

*-d*, *--divisor* /number/

#+begin_quote
Speed up the replay displaying this /number/ of times. The argument is a
floating-point number. It's called divisor because it divides the
timings by this factor. This option overrides old-style arguments.

#+end_quote

*-m*, *--maxdelay* /number/

#+begin_quote
Set the maximum delay between updates to /number/ of seconds. The
argument is a floating-point number. This can be used to avoid long
pauses in the typescript replay.

#+end_quote

*-h*, *--help*

#+begin_quote
Display help text and exit.

#+end_quote

*-V*, *--version*

#+begin_quote
Print version and exit.

#+end_quote

* EXAMPLES

#+begin_quote
#+begin_example
% script --log-timing file.tm --log-in script.in
Script started, file is script.out
% date
<etc, etc>
% exit
Script done, file is script.out
% scriptlive --log-timing file.tm --log-in script.in
#+end_example

#+end_quote
